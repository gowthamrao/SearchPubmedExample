Buprenorphine treatment of OUD improves quality of life and reduces both overdose risk and mortality. Additionally, buprenorphine decreases high-risk behaviors linked to transmission of HIV and hepatitis C.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Despite the many well-established benefits of buprenorphine treatment for OUD, adoption in most EDs remains limited.</p><p>There is an urgent need to roll out large-scale interventions to reduce opioid-related overdose deaths. Although results from controlled trials of ED-initiated buprenorphine are promising, studies of patient outcomes from clinical implementation of low-threshold access to buprenorphine treatment in EDs are lacking.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231573r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> A substantial effect of ED buprenorphine access on subsequent OUD treatment engagement could potentially help set benchmarks for buprenorphine delivery to ED patients with OUD, enhance clinical decision-making, and guide policy efforts aimed at optimizing the ED&#8217;s role in addressing the opioid crisis. Therefore, this study examined the association of ED buprenorphine treatment (including buprenorphine administration, prescription, or both) with subsequent OUD treatment engagement at 30 days after the ED visit.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-ZOI231573"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-ZOI231573"><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>The CA Bridge Patient Outcomes Study was conducted from April 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022.

All front-end staff were recommended to be trained in motivational interviewing and harm-reduction principles as strategies to encourage patients to openly communicate concerns around their opioid use or interest in treatment. Suspected OUD was confirmed by the attending ED physician, and all patients (regardless of participation in the cohort study) were offered both buprenorphine treatment and a consultation with a patient navigator.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Participant recruitment for the cohort study was conducted during regular business hours (approximately 9:00 <sc>am</sc> to 6:00 <sc>pm</sc>, Monday through Friday). Patients were eligible for inclusion in the cohort study if they were aged at least 18 years, had OUD as confirmed by the attending ED physician, were offered CA Bridge services, and agreed to provide informed consent to participate.

Standardized data forms were used to abstract relevant data (sociodemographics, substance use history, OUD treatment history, and clinical encounter information) from the EHR at baseline (ED visit) and at 7 and 30 days after the ED visit. Participants were administered surveys on clinically relevant information (including self-identified race and ethnicity) at baseline during the ED visit and at 30 days through a telephone call with research staff. For the 30-day surveys, research assistants attempted to contact all study participants. These attempts included multiple telephone calls starting at 25 days and continuing to 37 days after the ED visit for those participants who initially did not respond.</p><p>The eAppendix in <xref rid="note-ZOI231573-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> describes the data source for key variables. Race and ethnicity was included to assess for potential disparities in treatment uptake and patient outcomes. These data were categorized as Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black (hereinafter Black), non-Hispanic White (hereinafter White), or other race or ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or multiple races or ethnicities). Unstable housing was defined as not having one&#8217;s own house, apartment, or shared housing, as measured by self-report or documentation in the participant&#8217;s EHR. A blinded researcher abstracted data for 10% of the medical records (n&#8201;=&#8201;53), and there was 97.1% agreement with almost perfect interrater reliability (&#954;&#8201;=&#8201;0.95).</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-ZOI231573"><title>Measures</title><p>Consistent with prior studies conducted in EDs concerning medication treatment for individuals with OUD, the primary exposure, ED buprenorphine treatment, was defined as either buprenorphine administration or prescription during the ED visit.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The primary outcome was OUD treatment engagement at 30 days (allowable range, 25-37 days) after the ED visit as determined by a composite measure of any or all of the following: participant self-report, EHR documentation of an active (non-ED clinician) prescription, or documentation of attendance at an OUD treatment visit. Participants were asked about their use of buprenorphine and engagement in treatment during the 30-day survey telephone call with research staff. Then the EHR was abstracted using standardized forms for indication of treatment engagement including an active buprenorphine prescription. The prescription drug monitoring program was not directly queried. However, at all sites, the ED clinical team (patient navigator and ED physician) maintained a standard practice of querying the prescription drug monitoring program to assess engagement in care after discharge for ED patients treated with buprenorphine. Any buprenorphine prescription that was filled was then documented in the EHR. Thus, the EHR data abstraction would include such documentation. Any participants lost to follow-up, defined as both no response to the 30-day follow-up telephone call and no EHR clinical documentation following the ED visit, were classified as not engaged in OUD treatment at 30 days.</p></sec><sec id="H2-5-ZOI231573"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Participant characteristics were described using frequencies for categorical variables and medians (IQRs) for continuous variables, compared by ED buprenorphine treatment status. A Poisson regression was used to assess the association of ED buprenorphine treatment with OUD treatment engagement at 30 days. Modified Poisson regression yields a direct estimate of the risk ratio by fitting a Poisson regression model with a binary outcome; all individuals were assigned a value of 1 for their time at risk, because this was a cohort study in which all participants were followed for the same amount of time.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231573r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Robust sandwich estimators were used to produce valid variance estimates, as Poisson regression with a binary outcome has been shown to yield overestimated variances.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> To account for hospital-level effects, the site was included as a group-level random effect.

The high uptake of ED buprenorphine treatment and its association with OUD treatment engagement at 30 days highlight the success of the CA Bridge intervention and underscores the critical access point to OUD treatment that EDs can provide. These findings are notable given that our study population had a high prevalence of comorbid mental health conditions, self-reported fentanyl and methamphetamine use, and adverse social conditions including unstable housing and reliance on Medicaid insurance.</p><p>Our findings of 30-day OUD treatment engagement compare favorably with buprenorphine initiation in specialty office settings.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231573r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Many of the traditionally expected steps&#8212;such as complex intake evaluations and treatment readiness assessment&#8212;in buprenorphine initiation are omitted in the CA Bridge low-threshold model that emphasizes &#8220;making the right thing the easy thing&#8221; through a flexible, harm-reduction approach that promotes convenience, comfort, and interpersonal engagement with patient navigators.<sup><xref rid="zoi231573r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although the focus of this analysis was on the medication component of the CA Bridge intervention, patient navigation is an important bundled intervention. Patient navigators follow up with patients within 7 to 14 days of ED discharge, with a focus on identifying challenges to treatment engagement and working with patients to surmount these barriers. Site clinical champions and patient navigators are trained to facilitate coordinated care that links acute ED interventions with outpatient services to promote ongoing engagement in multidisciplinary treatment for OUD after the ED visit. The low OUD treatment engagement at 30 days among those not treated with buprenorphine emphasizes the need for additional interventions to reach this population. Individuals who chose not to receive ED buprenorphine treatment likely had more treatment challenges, as demonstrated by higher percentages of patients experiencing unstable housing, comorbid mental illness, and use of other substances, including alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine, or benzodiazepines, compared with patients who chose to receive ED buprenorphine treatment. Additionally, the proportion of patients receiving ED buprenorphine treatment who had a consultation with a patient navigator was higher compared with those who did not receive ED buprenorphine treatment. Future studies are needed to describe the effect of patient navigation on both uptake of buprenorphine treatment among ED patients with OUD and subsequent engagement in treatment after discharge.</p><sec id="H2-6-ZOI231573"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. The high rate of acceptance of buprenorphine treatment suggests selection bias toward patients with interest in treatment and may bias the association between ED buprenorphine treatment and 30-day treatment engagement. Identification of patients with OUD was done through multiple strategies, and it was not practically possible to track all potential study participants with OUD in the high-volume ED setting with multiple clinical staff engaging patients along multiple clinical handoffs common in ED care. Some participants may have been clinically diagnosed with OUD or engaged in treatment that was not documented in their EHR or referred to the research team. Our findings are also subject to residual confounding due to potentially incomplete or incorrect control of confounders. Furthermore, there may be misclassification in the assessment of the primary outcome. Among the 17 of 213 participants (8.0%) without clinical documentation of an active buprenorphine prescription, self-report of engagement in treatment was not independently confirmed, and social desirability bias due to stigma and discrimination associated with substance use may have led some participants to falsely report engagement in treatment. Furthermore, achievement of the primary outcome does not mean that all patients had 30-day continuous OUD treatment, since not all patients who was engaged in treatment at 30 days had continually been taking buprenorphine for the full 30 days after the ED visit. Finally, the regional context of California could limit the generalizability of these findings to patients in other areas, as the study participants may not be representative of all ED patients with OUD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI231573"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this cohort study suggest that among ED patients with OUD, treatment with buprenorphine may substantially improve the likelihood of sustained treatment engagement 1 month later. Future research should investigate techniques to optimize both the uptake and effectiveness of buprenorphine initiation in low-threshold settings such as the ED.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI231573"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi231573r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group>.
