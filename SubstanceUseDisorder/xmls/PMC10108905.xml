During the DB phase, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive PP6M (700 mg eq. or 1000 mg eq.) or PP3M (350 mg eq. or 525 mg eq.). The doses of PP6M for the patients in the PP6M group were chosen equivalent to the most prescribed doses of PP1M and PP3M.

experienced &#8805;1 TEAEs (<xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The majority of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and the most common TEAEs (&#8805;2% in either group) were increased weight, headache, nasopharyngitis, and injection-site pain. Serious TEAEs (&#8805;1% in either group) were experienced by 16 (6.2%) patients in the PP6M group and 6 (4.8%) patients in the PP3M group. The most common serious TEAEs (&gt;5 patients) were related to the worsening of schizophrenia (6 [1.0%], PP6M and none for PP3M). A total of 8 (3.1%) patients in the PP6M group and 2 (1.6%) patients in the PP3M group withdrew from the DB phase due to TEAEs. In European PP6M vs PP3M groups, the incidence of EPS-related TEAEs including parkinsonism, akathisia, dyskinesia, dystonia, and tremor was 4.6% vs 2.4%, 3.1% vs 2.4%, 1.9% vs 0, 0.8% (each) and 0 vs 0.4%, respectively; akathisia being the only one significant. There were no cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Among European PP6M and PP3M groups injection-site-related TEAEs were observed in fewer than 6% of patients, were mostly mild in severity, and included injection-site induration (1.5%, 1.6%), swelling (1.5%, 0.8%), discomfort (0.4%, 0.8%), hemorrhage (0.4%, 0), and edema (0.4%, 0). No cases of injection-site reaction were reported as serious, and none led to discontinuation of treatment. The most common events were related to the worsening of schizophrenia (PP6M: 4 [1.5%]; PP3M: 0). One (0.8%) death due to pulmonary embolism was reported in the PP3M group and was considered unrelated to the study drug by the investigator.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>This post hoc subgroup analysis confirmed the non-inferiority of PP6M to PP3M in the European subpopulation and the findings were consistent with those in the global population. The efficacy or safety while transitioning from PP1M or PP3M to PP6M was similar and consistent. The majority (&gt;90%) of patients in both the PP6M and PP3M treatment groups completed the 48-week DB phase without a relapse. The results from the secondary efficacy endpoints also suggested that PP6M displayed similar efficacy to PP3M in the treatment of European patients with schizophrenia. The low relapse rates and the efficacy of PP6M in the European subpopulation in delaying relapse and improving symptoms were consistent with those reported in the global study. Efficacy results in the European subpopulation were similar as most patients (53.4%) as compared to global (46.4%) had not received any LAIs prior to entering the study as they were receiving OAPs.</p><p>Safety and tolerability profiles of PP6M and PP3M during the DB phase in the European subpopulation were comparable. The incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in the European subpopulation as compared with that reported in the global study. Headache in the PP6M group and weight gain and nasopharyngitis in the PP3M group were the most common TEAEs observed. Serious TEAEs observed were similar in both treatment groups, mostly related to worsening psychiatric-related symptoms. No new safety findings were reported. It is previously noted that to optimize AP treatments for individual patients, it is useful to collect information on demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and it would be helpful to identify the most effective therapy appropriate to the needs of each subgroup.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Though differences in health-care systems along with disparities in race and ethnicities can influence efficacy and safety responses in patients treated with APs, this study did not reveal any major differences in the European population compared to the global population. We note that European data comprised 54.7% of the global population data.</p><p>Among the existing LAIs, PP6M provides the longest dosing interval with twice-yearly dosing. Assured medication delivery displays sustained therapeutic effects; the reduced frequency of injections required with PP6M can help meet treatment needs in terms of improved patient adherence and a reduced risk of relapse compared with oral or other LAI APs that require more frequent administrations. Real-world evidence indicates an improvement in the long-term treatment continuation upon a decrease in the frequency of treatment injections.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The convenience of LAIs with long dosing intervals is expected to have positive impact on social functioning and quality of life that contribute to overall clinical stability in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, by reducing hospitalizations and improving medication adherence, LAIs can improve long-term functionality and facilitate better social integration and patient empowerment. In a real-world observational study, early introduction of PP3M in recently diagnosed schizophrenia was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in social functioning and high level of treatment satisfaction, while maintaining symptomatic stability.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another real-world observational study from Hungary, with larger sample size reports greater 1-year and 1.5-year longer median time to discontinuation and treatment continuation rates for second-generation AP LAIs compared with OAPs. Additionally, the study also suggested that the time to treatment discontinuation of PP3M was observed to be lower than previous LAIs.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Longer intervals of medication may also be desirable for patients who are socially isolated or less connected to the healthcare system.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#8211;22</xref> It also can be advantageous during a health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> PP6M can reduce the need for patients with schizophrenia to attend the clinic every month or 3-months for injections, thus allowing more time for a physician to intervene and focus on other aspects of treatment to further improve quality of life.</p><p>As PP6M requires only twice-yearly injections, it may offer an advantage for patients with schizophrenia who are vulnerable to relapse by potentially allowing greater time for a clinician to intervene and resume treatment. This represents a significant advancement over existing treatments; thus, patients, particularly those who are difficult to reach, would have longer medication coverage. Additionally, switching patients to LAIs may be beneficial in the early course of schizophrenia. Furthermore, after patients are stabilized on once-month LAIs, advancement to progressively longer-acting LAIs may be facilitated. Longer follow-up studies are warranted to assess PP6M treatment safety and impact on patients&#8217; adherence, functioning, caregiver burden, quality of life, and satisfaction in real-world patients switching from PP1M or PP3M to PP6M.</p><p>The post hoc nature of this analysis with a small number of patients is the major limitation of this study. Patients entering the DB phase were already responsive to or stable with PP1M or PP3M treatment, which may also be a reason for the high rates of completion and the low rates of relapse. Unlike real-life practice, patients treated with PP6M and PP3M had no opportunities for dose adjustments. To maintain blinding, all patients in the study received 3-month injections, including those in the PP6M cohort, so they did not experience the full convenience of a 6-month regimen. Some varied responses observed in the study may be attributed to the occurrence of different ethnicities, as well as differences in healthcare delivery within the European populations.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results in the European subgroup are comparable to the global study population. Efficacy and safety results showed no significant differences when transitioning directly from PP1M or PP3M to PP6M. Efficacy of PP6M was non-inferior to that of PP3M in preventing relapse in patients with schizophrenia previously stabilized on doses of PP1M or PP3M. No new safety signals particularly for PP6M emerged specifically for the European subgroup. In European PP6M vs PP3M groups, the incidence of EPS-related TEAEs was similar except for akathisia. No cases of injection-site reaction were reported as serious, and none led to discontinuation of treatment. The most common events were related to the worsening of schizophrenia. Along with PP1M and PP3M, PP6M provides flexible dosing regimens for increased adherence, especially in cases where reducing the frequency of injections is desirable. These flexible dosing regimens can aid in optimizing therapy management for patients with schizophrenia from European regions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Salgo Merin Ricki Elenjikamalil, PhD (SIRO Clinpharm Pvt.
