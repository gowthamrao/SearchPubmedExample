Over the 3-year period before the measure was implemented, 58&#8201;054&#160;168 boxes of zolpidem were reimbursed vs. 24&#8201;896&#160;772 boxes over the 3-year period after the measure was implemented (decrease of &#8764;57%). The proportion of reports that included zolpidem gradually increased between 2014 and 2017 and then decreased between 2018 and 2020 (respectively 1.488 and 1.079 per 1000 reimbursed boxes).</p><p>

The number of NOTS reported over the two periods of equivalent duration was comparable (245 vs. 214). Concerning the patient-related factors reported, comparing the 3-year period after the measure vs. the 3-year period before the measure, the mean age of consumers was slightly higher (43.3 vs. 42.6), as was the proportion of women (53.5% vs. 49.4%), and patients tended to have more vulnerability factors (76.6%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;164 vs. 69.0%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;169, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.07), particularly regarding the consumption of related substances (66.8%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;143 vs. 57.9%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;142, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.05): users mentioned in the NOTS in the period after the measure consumed significantly more frequently controlled substances (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) and alcohol (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) and had significantly more reported diagnoses of dependence (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.04) than those mentioned before the measure. The unlawful method of obtention increased between the two study periods (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;78, 31.8% vs. <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;87, 40.6%) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.05). In more than two-thirds of cases, it involved nomadism, mostly medical in both periods. Falsified prescriptions (28.9% before the measure vs. 10.3% after) and street shopping and obtention on the internet seemed relatively stable. The other unlawful methods of obtention mentioned in our NOTS seemed to be on the rise and represented in the period after the measure nearly a third of cases of illicit procurement (illicit procurement by health care facility staff as self-prescription or workplace theft, giving or stealing from a third party, requesting a prescription for a friend or family member or a prescription of convenience, assault or lying to obtain a prescription, overlap of prescriptions and prescription theft). Regarding the items marking the use outside the SPC mentions, comparing the period before the measure vs. the period after the measure, (i) overuse tended to decrease; it was mentioned in 79.2% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;194) vs. 73.4% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;157) of the total notifications analyzed, the dose consumed was significantly lower (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.02) and the median dose was divided by two in the cases reported (80&#8201;mg vs. 40&#8201;mg per day); (ii) users subject to notification had a higher median anteriority of use (72&#8201;months vs. 84&#8201;months); and (iii) the proportion of misusers increased significantly: 43.6% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;107) vs. 59.3% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;127) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Focus on the NOTS reported to the FAN that mentioned misuse. Comparing misusers vs. non-misusers in both periods, misusers were mostly men, significantly younger (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) and appeared to have more risk factors for substance use disorder than non-misusers. About three-quarters of them presented at least one risk factor for substance use disorder, mainly the consumption of related substances. Over the two periods, the median dose consumed by misusers was three times higher than the median dose consumed by non-misusers. The median anteriority remained more than 30&#8201;months lower than the values reported among non-misusers over the two periods. Regarding misuse for unapproved indication, in a third of cases regardless of the period, at least one effect other than hypnotic was sought. Non-hypnotic effects were classified into two categories based on the terms used in the notification: &#8216;calming effects&#8217; (anxiolytic, amnesia, antidepressant, analgesic, self-treatment, descent or replacement, potentiating association with buprenorphine, alcohol, benzodiazepines and zopiclone) and &#8216;stimulating effects&#8217; (stimulant and recreational). When an effect other than hypnotic was sought, it was calming effects in nearly three-fourth of cases (69.3%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;61 in the period after the measure and 73.1%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;57 in the period before). In both periods, the most sought-after non-hypnotic effect remained the anxiolytic effect. Comparing the period after the measure vs. the period before the measure among misusers, there was a significant decrease in the dose consumed (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) in the NOTS reported to the FAN; the median dose was divided by more than two (60&#8201;mg vs. 140&#8201;mg per day), 75% of misusers consumed at most 140&#8201;mg per day after the measure vs. 270&#8201;mg per day before the measure and the median anteriority increased (72&#8201;months vs. 48&#8201;months). Misuse for both an unapproved route of administration (13.1% vs. 9.4%) and an unapproved indication (41.1% vs. 31.8%) tended to increase. There was a more marked use of the IV route than the nasal route (78.6% and 14.3% vs. 60.9% and 30.4%, respectively). When an effect other than hypnotic was sought, the use as a descent or replacement substance increased (5.1% vs. 13.6%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.03); stimulating effects were sought in 30.1% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;27) and 26.9% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;21) of cases, respectively. The proportion of daytime intake decreased (39.7% vs. 23.9%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.03) but remained at a high level. Among problematic zolpidem users mentioned in our NOTS, there was an increase after the measure in the use of benzodiazepines and zopiclone (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.02), controlled substances (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) and alcohol (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), and misusers appeared to have more diagnoses of

Thus, falsified prescriptions have decreased in a large proportion and in first place in OSIAP since 2011, zolpidem moved to seventh place in the period after the measure. An unlawful method of obtention was still reported in approximately one-third of the cases, which may be related to the difficulty of falsifying secure prescriptions. Regarding the decrease in the exposure of the population to zolpidem, our results show a decline of &#8764;57% in the number of boxes reimbursed in community pharmacies between the period before the measure and the period after; this may come from a decrease in the number of consumers, which was also found in other studies,<xref rid="ckad003-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15&#8211;17</sup></xref> but also from the decrease in the quantity consumed shown by our results. The number of reports of addictovigilance that included zolpidem relative to reimbursed data increased until 2018, before starting a slow decline. Nevertheless, these data should be compared with the total number of notifications of the network (all substances) in constant increases. Furthermore, the peak of notifications in 2017 might be linked to an announcement effect after a period of underreporting, all the more marked as the profile of abuse and misuse of zolpidem was known. In addition, the reimbursement data give the number of boxes and not the number of consumers, unlike notifications; the ZORRO historical cohort study, whose objective was to evaluate the impact of the change in the regulatory framework for zolpidem on the prescription of zolpidem and other sedative medications, considered the number of consumers by using data from the Generalist Sample of Beneficiaries (6). Thus, the proportion of notifications that included zolpidem in the total number of reports to the FAN reached its lowest level in 2020 (1.3%).</p><p>The change in regulation has therefore had an overall impact on all users, problematic consumers or not, misusers or not; otherwise, the number of notifications that included zolpidem would not have decreased as much. The overall decrease in the exposure of the population to zolpidem has implied less initiation of treatment<xref rid="ckad003-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ckad003-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and therefore a decrease in the number of users who initiate problematic use.

Experimental studies have shown that the sedative effect of zolpidem occurs at lower doses than those necessary to achieve anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and anxiolytic effects. This could be explained by a dose&#8211;dependent loss of selectivity for the &#945;1 subunit of GABA-A receptors, which are responsible for the sedative effect. Zolpidem could then bind to subunits of lower affinity, including &#945;2 and &#945;3, which are involved in the occurrence of the anxiolytic effect.<xref rid="ckad003-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The second population, &#8216;nonmisusers&#8217;, took zolpidem for hypnotic purposes without deviating from the typical route of administration. These were chronic users (75% of them had been consuming zolpidem for more than 3&#8201;years) of high doses (75% of them consumed more than 20&#8201;mg per day regardless of the period), and more than half of them had a diagnosis of dependence in 2018&#8211;20.</p><p>Data from the NOTS over the two periods appeared to show worsening cases after the regulatory change, in particular for people who were genuinely dependent and/or had comorbidities or misusers for whom zolpidem was the substance of interest. Thus, over the period after the measure, there was a significant increase in vulnerability factors and a tendency to have a longer duration of consumption compared to the period before the measure. Similar results are reported in the literature with other tools. For example, Istvan et al.,<xref rid="ckad003-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in a study conducted in the general population, showed that the regulatory change had a predominantly quantitative impact: if the number of potential problematic users decreased in absolute value after the regulatory change, the profile of these users remained similar before and after the measure. Nevertheless, our data seemed to show a worsening of the cases reported in the period after the implementation of the measure, especially in terms of the vulnerability of patients. Finally, it seems that some populations (such as older subjects) had more difficulty stopping their zolpidem consumption.<xref rid="ckad003-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>A report of the problem?</title><p>Furthermore, according to Istvan et al., since the regulatory change, 21% of chronic zolpidem users have replaced zolpidem with zopiclone (6). Rousselot et al.<xref rid="ckad003-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> also found that the preferential substitution, when there was replacement, was zopiclone. Zopiclone presents an abuse, dependence and misuse profile that seems less problematic than that for zolpidem.<xref rid="ckad003-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ckad003-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A more in-depth study of the addictovigilance data of zopiclone therefore seems necessary to evaluate the impact of this substitution and the possible appearance of new problematic uses for zopiclone.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This national study presents an analysis of the cases of problematic consumption of zolpidem on the basis of clinical and consumption data, which provides complementary information to studies based on medico-administrative data.</p><p>The main limitation of this methodology is the non-exhaustiveness of the data: although mandatory, reporting by health professionals is spontaneous, and we have no notion of the total number of zolpidem consumers.
