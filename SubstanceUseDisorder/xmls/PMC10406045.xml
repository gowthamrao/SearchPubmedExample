In a retrospective review using Medicare claims data between 2014 and 2019, we identified PAC payments within 90 days of hospitalization discharges and grouped hospitals into quintiles of PAC spending. The degree of variation present in PAC spending across hospital quintiles was evaluated after accounting for patient case-mix factors and hospital characteristics using multivariable regression models, adjusting for PAC setting choice by fixing the proportion of PAC discharge disposition across hospital quintiles, and adjusting for PAC intensity by fixing the amount of PAC spending across hospital quintiles.

The primary outcome was PAC spending within 90 days of discharge following hospitalization for traumatic hip fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean PAC spending varied widely between top versus bottom spending hospital quintiles ($31,831 vs $17,681). After price standardization, the difference between top versus bottom spending hospital quintiles was $8,964.

We selected for claims after hip fracture injury among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries &#8805;65.5 years old from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2019, using a nationally representative 20% sample. The age cutoff of 65.5 years old was chosen to permit adjustment for healthcare expenditures within the preceding 6 months before traumatic injury. Patients with third-party insurers (eg, Medicare Advantage plans) were excluded from analysis. These data were linked with the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals from 2016 to obtain hospital-level information.</p><p>Beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes (see Supplemental Table, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A180" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/AOSO/A180</ext-link>, which includes the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used to create the traumatic hip fracture injury cohort).

We defined PAC payments as the presence of claims for any of these types of services within 90 days of index hospitalization discharge: home with home health, skilled nursing facility (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation (IPR), outpatient rehabilitation, and long-term acute care (LTAC) facility. If patients were readmitted, the payments associated with readmission were included in the primary outcome measures. Each of these settings have different payment models that are important to acknowledge.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Skilled nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation, and LTAC facilities are reimbursed based on a per-diem basis with various adjustments according to the patient&#8217;s clinical status, functional status, and services provided. Conversely, home health services and inpatient rehabilitation are reimbursed on a per-case basis with similar adjustments so long as minimum services are provided. All payments were inflation-adjusted to 2019 US dollars ($USD).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Our goal was to determine the drivers of differences in mean episode PAC payments by hospital quintile. First, we investigated whether patient demographics, injury patterns, and hospital characteristics were systematically different between PAC spending quintiles. Hospitals were placed into quintiles based on their inflation-adjusted (2019 $USD) total mean PAC spending per episode. These characteristics were compared with &#967;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables or analysis of variance F-test for continuous variables.</p><p>Next, we compared the distributions of discharge destination (home, home health, skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation, and LTAC facility) across hospital quintiles of total PAC spending. We then measured how each component of PAC spending (skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation, home health, readmissions, outpatient rehabilitation, LTAC, plus total PAC spending) differed across hospital quintiles of PAC spending.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the degree to which mean episode PAC payment variation was explained by differences in geographic location, patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, readmissions, and choice and intensity of PAC setting across hospital quintiles. Sequential adjustment was performed to quantify PAC payment variation explained by the following factors: (1) price standardization; (2) patient characteristics (age, sex, race, Elixhauser comorbidities,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> injury severity score, complications during index hospitalization defined according to the Complications Screening Project that included pulmonary failure, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, renal failure, hemorrhage, surgical site infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> index hospitalization inpatient spending, and total prior 6-month spending); (3) hospital characteristics (bed size, teaching status, for-profit status, certified trauma center status, rural versus urban, critical access status, and annual traumatic hip fracture operative volume modeled a priori as a continuous variable with splines at 10 and 30 episodes per year in the study&#8217;s 20% representative sample); (4) readmissions; and (5) either choice of PAC setting or intensity of spending (the amount of spending within a PAC setting).</p><p>Price standardization was performed to account for intended differences in Medicare payments. These include compensation differences based on regional wage disparities, cost of living, illness severity, and the expense of caring for underinsured patients.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We used price standardization methods previously employed within our research group.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The methods have been described by researchers with the <italic toggle="yes">Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare</italic> and are similar to the methods used by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Sequential adjustments for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, and readmissions were performed using multivariable regression models. Observed-to-expected ratios were calculated using expected values from these models. To measure the effect of choice of the PAC setting, the percentage use of a given PAC setting was held constant across observations, while allowing spending to vary. To measure the effect of intensity, spending within a given PAC setting was held fixed, while allowing percentage use to vary. After the sequential inclusion of each level, we calculated the difference in mean episode PAC payments between the highest (Q5) and lowest (Q1) hospitals, as well as the percentage difference in PAC payments between quintiles, measured as a share of the lowest-spending quintile (mean 90-day PAC payments between the highest- (Q5) and lowest (Q1)-spending quintiles, divided by the mean 90-day PAC payment of the lowest (Q1)-spending quintile: (Q5 &#8211; Q1)/Q1).</p><p>We assessed statistical significance at &#945; = 0.05 with two-sided tests. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 and Stata 15.0. The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study as secondary use of existing data with waiver of consent.

Discharge to home with or without home health was also more common (13%) among the lowest-spending hospital quintile, although this difference was less substantial (quintile 5 = 8%). After adjusting for price standardization, case-mix, hospital characteristics and readmissions, subsequent adjustment for PAC setting, or intensity resulted in substantial reductions in differences in mean PAC spending between hospital quintiles (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Adjustment for PAC setting decreased the difference to $4119 per episode, whereas adjustment for PAC intensity decreased the difference to $3790 per episode. Following adjustment for setting or intensity 17.8%&#8211;19.4% of the original variability in mean PAC payments between hospital quintiles remained unexplained.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this nationally representative study of Medicare beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of traumatic hip fracture who underwent operative repair, we found that discharge to a PAC setting other than home is common, occurring in over 90% of cases. However, mean 90-day PAC payments vary substantially between treating hospitals. The highest-spending hospitals tended to discharge patients to IPR, whereas the lowest-spending hospitals tended to discharge patients to SNF settings. Patient, injury, and hospital characteristics explained little of the variation in PAC spending (4.8%), whereas setting or intensity of PAC explained most of the total variation (16%&#8211;17.6%) after price standardization in risk-adjusted payments.</p><p>If variation is largely driven by patient factors such as injury severity, demographic characteristics, and baseline comorbidities, then higher payments for sicker patients might be appropriate. However, substantial payment variations after adjusting for patient-level factors would suggest systems-level inefficiencies that can be targeted for intervention to improve the appropriateness and value of healthcare spending.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Concern regarding the relationship between the variation in healthcare expenditures and the quality of care has led to recent collaborative quality initiatives focused on achieving high-quality care with the efficient use of scarce healthcare resources.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>We found that even after controlling for patient, injury, and hospital characteristics, substantial variation exists across hospitals in PAC spending and utilization of PAC services. The decision regarding which if any PAC setting to discharge a patient to following traumatic hip fracture is complex and often involves input from a multidisciplinary team, in addition to the patient and their family. The team includes physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, case managers, social workers, and others. Preferences may exist among these team members who favor particular PAC settings even with similar case-mix characteristics between hospitals. This may be influenced by improved outcomes according to PAC setting among other hospitalized patient populations that members of the multidisciplinary team also manage. For instance, patients with cerebrovascular accident have been shown to have better functional outcomes when discharged to IPR facilities.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> To our knowledge, no qualitative studies have investigated decision patterns among multidisciplinary teams regarding choice of PAC setting among traumatic hip fracture patients. There is also evidence that nonclinical unmeasured hospital characteristics drives the majority of the variation in discharge location for trauma patients.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> It is also uncertain what influence patient preferences have on the choice of PAC setting.</p><p>The choice of PAC setting or intensity has not been shown to influence functional outcomes among hip or lower extremity fracture cohorts, although these observational studies are likely limited by selection bias.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Previous studies have suggested that recovery to pre-fracture activities of daily living (ADL) occurs in only 31% of patients following hip fracture and that a substantial portion (64%) of those with ADL independence before injury do not return to ADL independence following their acute care episode.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Whether the higher costs associated with settings such as IPR add value to the care of patients with hip fracture and justify their higher costs remains to be seen.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>Hospital ownership of PAC facilities may also play a role in choice of PAC setting. According to a recent study by Carroll et al, 80% of AHA hospitals owned at least 1 PAC facility.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> This might incentivize discharge to one of these facilities. Interestingly, the authors found that PAC facility ownership was associated with lower episode payments for SNF and home health services but higher episode payments for IPR settings. In our study, hospital factors such as bed size and teaching status were not associated with substantial PAC payment variation between hospital quintiles. However, hospital ownership of PAC facilities was not available for analysis in our study and its contribution to PAC payment variation between hospitals will be an important area of future research.</p><p>Finally, it is unclear to what degree variability in PAC facility availability contributes to variation in spending. Certain geographic locations may suffer from poor accessibility to timely placement of patients into rehabilitation facilities following traumatic hip fracture and this may affect utilization patterns beyond the control of the hospitals which discharge these patients. Data from the 2020 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Report to Congress show that nationwide inpatient rehabilitation average occupancy rates are near 67%, suggesting that overall occupancy is not a particular barrier to rehabilitation utilization, but that this may still be a factor in specific geographic locations.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p>Our study has several important limitations. The principal limitation to our analyses is related to the inability to assess functional status and its interaction with PAC utilization. Medicare claims do not contain granular clinical information regarding the degree to which patients are functional either prior to or following their acute hospitalization and recovery. This information has implications for patient eligibility for and appropriateness of PAC services and limits our assessment of how variation in functional status may account for variation in PAC spending. We are not aware of any prior studies suggesting that significant variation in the baseline mobility or functional independence of patients across hospitals exists for hip fracture patients in the United States, and therefore would not expect this to explain a significant proportion of the variance in PAC spending. The lack of mobility or functionality data in the postinjury period also limits our ability to assess the degree to which variation in the utilization of PAC rehabilitation services improves outcomes in these patients, and therefore, we are unable to make any assessment of value of these services in this analysis. Our analysis is also limited to fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who underwent operative management for their injuries and therefore may not be generalizable to other populations with hip fracture such as those less than 65 years of age, Medicare beneficiaries with additional third-party insurers, or patients who do not undergo operative management for their injuries. Finally, we excluded patients with significant polytrauma (AIS &gt; 1 to any other body region) and our results may not be generalizable to this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study demonstrates a substantial variation in PAC payments after a traumatic hip fracture between the highest- and lowest-spending hospital quintiles.
