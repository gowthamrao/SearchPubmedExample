The results of this study show real world incidences of SSI in CFEA and hybrid groin revascularisation procedures. It also used validated criteria in the definition of SSI as per the CDC criteria,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> which was also used in the GIVE study.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The overall SSI incidence in the current study was comparable with the GIVE study, which reported an SSI incidence of 8.6%. Furthermore, when HR alone was considered, the SSI incidence was lower than that reported in the GIVE study (9% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 12.1%, respectively). The GIVE study is a multicentre study, whilst the current study was a single centre study and all cases were performed in a hybrid theatre, which may have had some impact on outcomes. Another previous multicentre study in 2022 found that of 128 patients who underwent hybrid revascularisation, 25% developed an SSI, although the criteria used for diagnosis of SSI were not stated.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0115">An alternative to hybrid revascularisation in treating multilevel arterial disease involving the CFA is to arrange a separate endovascular procedure; this was the case in six of the current patients who underwent CFEA. However, arranging a separate endovascular procedure to complement an open procedure carries its own risks; it would also result in repeat admissions for the patient and increased cost. Muller et&#160;al.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> retrospectively analysed 676 cases of iliac endovascular procedures and identified a complication rate of 4.3%, which included vascular site complications, bleeding, and pseudoaneurysm.</p><p id="p0120">There is increasing interest in the endovascular approach for CFA disease, but it remains predominantly being used in extremely high risk patients.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> There is an ongoing multinational randomised control trial (SUPERSURG-RCT) being conducted to evaluate the role of endovascular therapy in CFA disease compared with CFEA, with an expected study completion date in 2025.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing endovascular procedures with open surgery alone in treating CFA disease has shown that endovascular procedures resulted in inferior long term arterial patency rates.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Until there is more evidence available, surgical repair of CFA disease remains the gold standard. Therefore, evaluating outcomes, especially of SSI, is important, as there are data to support increased morbidity and length of stay in patients developing SSI.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p id="p0125">Another consideration in reducing SSI incidence in patients undergoing open groin surgery is the use of closed incision negative pressure dressings at the index procedure. Studies have previously shown that these can reduce SSI rates, particularly in patients with recurrent groin incisions.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, the dressings themselves are costly and recent studies have shown they have little effect in reducing wound infections and advocate for a risk factor based model when considering their use.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="p0130">Despite the increased operating time of HR procedures, this did not result in an increase in the SSI incidence, length of stay, amputation rate, or mortality rate in the current study. Therefore, HR procedures should be considered where appropriate for the management of multilevel CFA disease. Patients may also benefit from a single operation and avoid the risks associated with a separate endovascular procedure. There are also benefits in reducing the number of hospital admissions and costs associated with multiple procedures, as shown in patients with acute limb ischaemia.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p id="p0135">This study was limited by its retrospective nature and by being a single centre study. It used validated criteria in recording SSI using the CDC criteria<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and all cases of SSI were diagnosed by a consultant vascular surgeon who may or may not have been the operating surgeon. However, these criteria contain an element of subjectivity, especially for the superficial SSI category, which may be diagnosed in the presence of purulent discharge without an identified organism or need for further surgery. Another limitation was regarding the follow up outcomes. Late complications or SSI that happened in the community after the patient was discharged and were managed in primary care would not have made it into the records; therefore, SSI data are more accurate in the short term, not the long term. However, this is a limitation of any observational study and is applicable even for the GIVE study.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0140">Hybrid revascularisation for CFA disease is safe and has comparable rates of SSI, amputation, and mortality compared with CFEA alone.
