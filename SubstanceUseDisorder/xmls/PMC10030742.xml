Overall, 23.4% of patients were not employed and 6.5% received disability pensions. Current work cessation was prevalent in 120 patients, and 28 of those were out of work for 10 years or longer. Of the 590 currently employed patients, 31.9% reported absenteeism and 35.9% reported presenteeism for &gt;1&#8201;month within the past year. Multivariate logistic regression identified low disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index), better physical function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) and better global functioning (Assessment of SpondylAarthritis International Society&#8211;Health Index) as the main predictors for unimpaired WP (n=242).

</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were conducted using SPSS V.27. We used a standard significance criterion of &#945;=0.05 for all analyses. For statistical analysis, the &#967;&#178; test, Student t-test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test were performed as appropriate. We analysed a &#8216;full study population&#8217; sample and, for a more detailed analysis of work outcomes, a &#8216;WP study population&#8217; sample. The latter group was derived by excluding old age retirees and students to define a cohort of participants who should have full access to WP, that is, participants who are eligible to work. For describing the characteristics of the full study population and the WP study population, we determined absolute and relative frequencies (reported in percentages). For non-categorical variables, we reported the arithmetic mean and SD. To determine the impact of age on workplace experience, the WP was divided into two age cohorts based on the mean age of 47 years in the full set population. Particular focus was on general characteristics and work characteristics, including duration of work cessation, short-term and long-term absenteeism, presenteeism in relation to workplace experiences and the impact of disease activity and function on WP. Further, we examined descriptively whether there was a correlation between presenteeism and absenteeism, and presenteeism and impairment of daily activities. Because work impairment is a time-dependent process, we performed similar analyses in two age groups separated by the mean age of the WP study population. We used binary logistic regression to determine the main predictors for work impairment. Model assumptions were verified by testing for the absence of multicollinearity between the independent variables using the Pearson correlation matrix, variance inflation factors (VIFs) and condition indexes (CIs); a VIF of &gt;10&#8201;and a CI of &gt;100 suggest multicollinearity. We used WP (impaired vs unimpaired) as Bernoulli distributed target variable where impaired WP=0&#8201;and unimpaired WP=1. We computed univariate logit models independently for explanatory variables of particular interest (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for the variables). The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate regression coefficients. To decide whether to include a variable in multivariate regression, we evaluated the variables with regard to model significance and quality. Model quality of the fitted models was assessed by the &#8722;2 log likelihood value indicating deviance, the Cox and Snell pseudo R&#178; (R<sup>2</sup>
<sub>CS</sub>), Nagelkerke pseudo R&#178; (R<sup>2</sup>
<sub>N</sub>), and classification matrices indicating prediction quality. Variables that achieved significance in their univariate logit models and good model quality were included in the multivariate logit model. The multivariate model was assessed by these same criteria. For interval estimation, we used CIs and ORs exp(&#223;<sub>j</sub>). Additionally, we conducted a post hoc Games-Howell test to compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by different types of WP impairment (unimpaired WP, short-term presenteeism, short-term absenteeism, no employment and disability pension).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression with WP as target variable (unimpaired WP=1, n=695)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Predictors</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impaired WP (n=453)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unimpaired WP (n=242)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#946;<sub>j</sub> (constant &#946;<sub>0</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95%&#8201;CI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#967;<sup>2</sup>

Next, we calculated the frequency of patients with unimpaired WP, that is, patients who were currently employed, with no current presenteeism (&#8804;20% by WPAI&#8211;axSpA), no current absenteeism (by WPAI-axSpA) and lack of prolonged sick leave within the last year (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). There was a larger proportion of patients who had impaired WP (65.2%, n=453) than unimpaired WP (34.8%, n=242). Importantly, 348 patients (50.1%) with impaired WP were nevertheless part of the workforce. A continuous increase in age did not impact (or was not associated with increased) absenteeism and presenteeism in the WP study population (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>), contrary to what was observed for unemployment status and disability pensions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C, D</xref>), and no increase with disease duration was observed (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>).

Importantly, only 48 of these patients (40.0%) were unable to work for a short duration of less than 1&#8201;year, but 72 (60.0%) were out of work for longer than a year, and 28 patients (23.3%) reported being unable to work for 10 years or longer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). This indicates that long-term work cessation is a major problem in patients currently unable to work due to their axSpA.

Patients with impaired WP tended to have worse global functioning (ASAS-HI), impaired physical function (BASFI) and higher disease activity (BASDAI). The ORs imply that the chances of having unimpaired WP decrease by a factor of 0.866, 0.576 and 0.816 if the ASAS-HI, BASDAI and BASFI scores, respectively, increase by one point (ie, if health, disease activity and functional capacity worsen).

We investigated the short-term and long-term durations of work outcomes and included questions about different workplace experiences.</p><p>In terms of general characteristics, the axSpA population reported in the current study is comparable to the general population in Germany across various characteristics, such as average age (male: 46.7 vs 43.2, female: 47.8 vs 45.8), BMI (male: 28.1 vs 26.5, female: 27.6 vs 24.9) and education (27.0% vs 18.0% with a degree in higher education).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A high proportion of the employed patients showed presenteeism and in addition, we observed a high degree of negative workplace experiences. These included not only factors that might contribute to a lesser income but also factors that might influence participation in the workforce and lead to a higher risk of being at least temporarily unemployed. Self-reported discrimination at the workplace was frequent and adaptations at the workplace were often required. Our data support the literature reporting the severe impact of axSpA on WP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;10 13 15 31</xref>
</p><p>Long-term unemployment due to axSpA was reported, and a large proportion of patients received disability pensions. Importantly, cessation of workforce participation was frequently a long-term problem. Of patients eligible to work, the majority reported impaired WP. Almost a fifth of employed patients showed short-term absenteeism and sick leave was common. However, we demonstrated that short-term absenteeism, as analysed using the WPAI&#8211;axSpA, did not necessarily reflect the overall burden of sick leave over a year in our cohort. Random weekly variations of absenteeism are not likely to confound the results given in a large study population. However, a crucial factor for assessing the WPAI is the existence of current employment. This might be a significant problem in a population with a high proportion of workers with negative workplace experiences (eg, due to chronic diseases) who frequently change jobs and who, although unemployed, still consider themselves as part of the workforce. These patients would be a priori excluded from the analysis of the WPAI, and this might be a potential bias which could also explain the discrepancy between long-term absenteeism and short-term absenteeism as analysed via WPAI-axSpA. As such, our data suggest the importance of considering the choice and influence of outcome measures of work impairment.</p><p>Even though grave WP impairments existed in our population, only a small proportion of patients had previously participated in vocational rehabilitation or reintegration programmes, suggesting the need for better access to these programmes in Germany. Multivariate regression identified worse global functioning (ASAS-HI), impaired physical function (BASFI) and higher disease activity (BASDAI) as the main predictors of impaired WP. Other studies have already identified a correlation between these PROs and treatment,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 17 32&#8211;34</xref> suggesting that treatments which target alleviating symptoms related to physical function and disease activity will likely also improve WP. BASDAI subvariables only reached significance in the univariate models, suggesting they were not able to explain any variance beyond the other predictors. Both short-term presenteeism and absenteeism are associated with PROs including higher disease activity and limitations in physical function.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 35 36</xref> Interestingly, some patients with a low or very low BASDAI score reported at least some degree of presenteeism and a similar observation could be made for BASFI function. However, an increase in BASDAI activity resulted in higher impairments of work productivity compared with BASFI function. This descriptive examination of the data suggested an association between BASDAI and BASFI scores and short-term presenteeism in our cohort. Moreover, an increase in fatigue (BASDAI #1) suggests an association between fatigue and short-term presenteeism as well.</p><p>We found no differences in terms of disease duration; as WP is already substantially reduced in patients with early axSpA,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> effective fast-acting therapies are needed. Strikingly, biological treatment did not significantly improve WP. This supports some previous findings<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and highlights that the medical need remains high and requires urgent attention. Although other studies suggest biological treatment can lead to improvements in work disability and disease symptoms,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#8211;39</xref> substantial unmet needs remain.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> It may be that biological treatment improves outcomes for some domains of impairment but not all; for instance, Wallman and colleagues only found improved work disability after treatment, while disability pension levels remained similar.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition to biological treatment, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes are likely to be required as they have a positive effect on quality of life in terms of physical function and pain.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#8211;42</xref> Additional effects can be achieved if rehabilitation is added with behavioural therapy, although it is unclear which effect is achieved by behavioural training and rehabilitation alone.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Further, EULAR recommendations also cover a range of lifestyle behaviours, including exercise and diet recommendations, that are likely to complement treatment plans.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Specialised rheumatological rehabilitation programmes use a multidisciplinary team approach to address the different individual needs of patients, including education and provision of self-management strategies which are addressed by recommendations.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45&#8211;48</xref> Rehabilitation programmes are an effective way to provide patients with axSpA the access to healthcare professionals, which may improve participation.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 49</xref>

The study included a variety of demographic, clinical and HR-QoL confounders, as well as vocational rehabilitation programmes and other work-related information about the impact of axSpA on work typically neglected in clinical settings and other studies (eg, adaptions at work, differences in treatment and workplace changes). These factors are important as WP is related not only to disease but also to other variables such as the social environment.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> Furthermore, the population was identified via diagnosis through rheumatologists at study sites and additional external monitoring was performed, making the results more reliable and specific to the axSpA population compared with other studies, such as the <italic toggle="yes">European map of axial spondyloarthritis</italic> (EMAS) survey<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which included patients with self-reported axSpA.</p><p>The comprehensiveness of the questions in this study offers a rich characterisation of the axSpA population that may guide future research and provide a framework for asking questions in a clinical setting, as well as direct workplace strategies to provide appropriate support. For instance, further distinction between patients according to their dominant domain of work impairment may provide insight if patients with distinct impairments also differ in other characteristics.</p><p>Impaired WP is not just limited to work life but can also create additional social and psychological burdens as well as indirect costs from an economic point of view (eg, sick leave and time loss). Despite multiple medical therapy options for axSpA and evidence for the effectiveness of biological treatment in improving outcomes, we observed substantially impaired WP in patients with axSpA. Current treatment recommendations emphasise the importance of considering patient characteristics, including sociodemographic factors, in therapy plans.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> This requires a thorough characterisation of the patient population and the complex relationships across different health domains. The current study stresses the need for adopting a broader view to fully understand the relevance of the different domains of work impairment and their impact on patients with axSpA.</p><p>AxSpA most frequently affects people in their second and third decades of life, which tend to be important years for establishing a professional career.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The average age of patients in the current study was around 47 years of age, which is similar to cohorts published earlier.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although patients &#8804;47 years of age had a longer disease duration, the impairments in work productivity were similar to those in patients &#8804;47&#8201;and &gt;47 years of age. Patients &gt;47 years of age were more likely to be unemployed (35.2%) compared with patients &#8804;47 years of age (11.5%). Nevertheless, presenteeism and absenteeism differed in both groups, resulting in a higher total impairment score in the &gt;47 cohort compared with patients &#8804;47. Perhaps future studies should aim to access the effect of AxSpA on a younger cohort.</p><p>However, there are several limitations to this study. The cross-sectional design does not allow for conclusions about temporal causality. The survey did not question the time course but recorded the patient&#8217;s condition at the time of survey completion only. Accordingly, we cannot draw conclusions about differences in WP that could occur over time. Further, we did not capture work capacity prior to disease onset. However, such data would be prone to errors in memory, whereas presenteeism and absenteeism questionnaires such as the WPAI, assessing the time frame of 1&#8201;week, have a reduced risk of incorrect recollection.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> In this study, we also asked about absenteeism in the last 12 months and the duration of the current work cessation. It must be emphasised that questioning about longer periods of times may increase the risk of recall bias.</p><p>Another limitation is that the self-reported WP and data on disease activity and physical function rely on PROs rather than objective measures such as the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> or the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Self-generated questions of the survey were not validated by external experts other than the authors of this work and psychometricians. In addition, we were not able to assess the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) level because we did not collect data for C reactive protein in this study. As no data about the frequency of consultation with the rheumatologist were collected, it was not possible to analyse the effect of tight control treatment on the working participation; therefore, we cannot determine if the WP results were influenced by the combination of short disease duration and tight control treatment.</p><p>As this study focused exclusively on the German population, it is difficult to draw conclusions about other populations as countries differ by various patient characteristics, such as the proportion of manual versus non-manual occupations, comorbidities and differences in employment, and health systems. Nevertheless, similar results have been found in various European countries,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as well as in Asia,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> suggesting patients across different geographical locations face similar difficulties. Further, we did not distinguish the type of employment; however, given the physical restrictions of the disease, manual workers tend to be more affected.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
