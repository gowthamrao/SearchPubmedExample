These wounds affect millions of individuals, leading to significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and increasing healthcare costs.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref> The growing prevalence of&#160;diabetes, obesity, and vascular diseases&#8212;major risk factors for chronic wounds&#8212;has further exacerbated this issue, particularly in aging populations.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite advances in wound care technologies, the management of chronic wounds remains a challenge, often requiring months or even years for complete healing. Complications such as&#160;infection, gangrene, and lower limb amputation&#160;pose significant risks, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, increased patient suffering, and loss of productivity.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The impact is especially pronounced in&#160;vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with limited access to healthcare services.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>While effective wound care depends on medical interventions such as&#160;debridement, advanced dressings, and infection control, communication plays a fundamental role in determining patient outcomes. Communication is a critical component in healthcare that influences&#160;clinical decision-making, treatment adherence, and patient engagement.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In chronic wound management, effective communication ensures that&#160;patients understand their treatment protocols, recognize early signs of complications, and follow medical advice accurately.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Research has consistently shown that&#160;poor communication is a leading cause of treatment non-compliance, which can lead to&#160;prolonged wound healing, preventable infections, and unnecessary hospitalizations.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, communication is vital in&#160;fostering trust between patients and healthcare providers. Many individuals with chronic wounds experience&#160;frustration, anxiety, and psychological distress&#160;due to the persistent nature of their condition.&#160;Empathetic and patient-centered communication&#160;can help alleviate these concerns, improving morale and increasing adherence to treatment regimens.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Beyond patient-provider interactions, communication also plays a crucial role in&#160;healthcare coordination. The management of chronic wounds often involves an&#160;interdisciplinary team&#160;that includes physicians, nurses, podiatrists, physical therapists, and dietitians.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Without effective communication among these professionals,&#160;delays in treatment, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent medical advice&#160;can occur, ultimately compromising patient outcomes.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The implementation of&#160;structured communication frameworks, such as the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) model, has been shown to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and reduce errors in wound care settings. Additionally, public health campaigns and patient education initiatives rely on&#160;clear communication&#160;to raise awareness about&#160;wound prevention strategies and self-care practices.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Despite its importance, communication in chronic wound management faces several challenges. One of the most significant barriers is&#160;health literacy. Many patients struggle with&#160;complex medical terminology, making it difficult for them to&#160;comprehend wound care instructions and medication guidelines.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#160;Limited health literacy has been directly linked to&#160;poor treatment adherence, increasing the likelihood of complications and prolonged healing times.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally,&#160;cultural and language differences&#160;can further complicate effective communication. In diverse healthcare settings, patients may hold&#160;traditional healing beliefs that conflict with modern medical practices, leading to&#160;resistance or misunderstanding of recommended treatments.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#160;The use of&#160;medical interpreters, culturally tailored educational materials, and multilingual resources&#160;is essential in overcoming these barriers.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Psychological and emotional factors also play a crucial role in&#160;communication effectiveness. Patients with chronic wounds often experience&#160;depression, anxiety, and social isolation, which can hinder their ability to engage with healthcare providers.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Addressing these emotional challenges through&#160;compassionate communication strategies, such as&#160;active listening and motivational interviewing, has been shown to&#160;improve treatment adherence and overall well-being.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#160;Additionally, the rapid advancement of&#160;digital health technologies&#160;is reshaping communication in wound care.&#160;Telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth) applications, and artificial intelligence-driven chatbots&#160;are emerging as innovative tools to enhance&#160;patient-provider interactions.&#160;Remote wound monitoring&#160;allows for&#160;real-time assessments, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and enabling early intervention in case of complications.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> AI-driven chatbots&#160;provide&#160;instant guidance on wound care practices, helping patients manage their conditions more effectively while alleviating the burden on healthcare professionals.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In low-resource environments, the management of chronic wounds of the lower limbs presents even greater challenges due to limited healthcare infrastructure, shortage of trained personnel, and restricted access to medical technologies. In such settings, effective communication becomes not only a clinical necessity but a critical determinant of care continuity and patient survival. Communication strategies must often compensate for the absence of specialized wound care services by empowering patients and caregivers with clear, culturally adapted education on wound management, hygiene, and warning signs of complications. Moreover, public health policies play a pivotal role in addressing systemic disparities by promoting community-based care models, task-shifting to trained lay workers, and the use of mobile communication tools to extend the reach of healthcare services. Policies that support inclusive health literacy programs, the translation of medical materials into local languages, and the subsidization of basic digital health technologies can significantly enhance the effectiveness of wound care in under-resourced settings. Thus, bridging the communication gap through policy-driven interventions is essential to achieving equity in wound care outcomes globally.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#8211;7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>However, the integration of&#160;technology in communication&#160;also presents challenges. The&#160;digital divide&#160;remains a significant concern, as&#160;older adults, rural populations, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups&#160;may have&#160;limited access to telehealth services and mobile applications.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#160;Ensuring that these technologies are&#160;accessible and user-friendly&#160;is essential in maximizing their benefits. Furthermore,&#160;ethical considerations&#160;surrounding&#160;patient privacy, data security, and informed consent&#160;must be carefully addressed as&#160;digital health solutions become more prevalent.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Given the complexities of&#160;chronic wound care&#160;and the pivotal role of&#160;communication in optimizing treatment outcomes, it is essential to examine&#160;how communication strategies can be improved&#160;to enhance&#160;patient adherence, interdisciplinary collaboration, and healthcare efficiency. This review explores&#160;the impact of communication in chronic wound management, highlighting&#160;key barriers and innovative solutions. By synthesizing&#160;current research, this study provides insights for&#160;healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers&#160;on how&#160;effective communication can improve patient outcomes&#160;and&#160;reduce healthcare disparities. Furthermore, it evaluates&#160;the role of technological advancements&#160;in&#160;bridging communication gaps and shaping the future of wound care management. Understanding these factors is crucial in developing&#160;evidence-based strategies&#160;that enhance&#160;communication effectiveness&#160;and ultimately contribute to&#160;better patient care and health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Data Sources</title><p>This review follows a systematic approach to analyzing literature on communication in chronic wound management.

Chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, arterial ulcers, and pressure injuries, require continuous and coordinated care involving multiple healthcare professionals. Without structured and patient-centered communication, adherence to treatment plans can be compromised, leading to delayed healing, increased risk of infection, and higher rates of hospital readmission.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><sec id="s0003-s2005-s3001"><title>Communication as a Tool for Enhancing Patient Adherence</title><p>One of the most significant challenges in chronic wound management is ensuring that patients adhere to prescribed treatments, including wound dressing changes, medication regimens, and lifestyle modifications.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Effective communication is crucial in this regard, as it allows healthcare providers to educate patients about their condition, clarify treatment instructions, and emphasize the importance of adherence. Studies indicate that patient education, when delivered in a structured, engaging, and culturally sensitive manner, improves adherence to wound care protocols and accelerates healing. Additionally, patients who receive clear verbal and written instructions are more likely to comply with medical advice, reducing the risk of complications and hospital visits.<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Healthcare professionals must consider patient literacy levels when communicating wound care instructions. Research shows that individuals with limited health literacy struggle to understand medical terminology and complex treatment guidelines, leading to improper wound care practices.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Simple language, visual aids, and interactive communication techniques&#8212;such as teach-back methods, where patients repeat instructions in their own words&#8212;enhance comprehension and promote adherence.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0003-s2005-s3002"><title>The Role of Emotional Support in Wound Management</title><p>Chronic wounds often cause significant emotional distress for patients, leading to frustration, anxiety, and depression.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The persistent nature of these wounds, coupled with social stigma and limited mobility, can contribute to feelings of helplessness and decreased motivation to adhere to treatment plans. In such cases, empathetic communication from healthcare providers plays a critical role in improving patient morale and engagement in self-care. Studies highlight that patient-provider interactions characterized by compassion, active listening, and psychological support contribute to better health outcomes.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Motivational interviewing (MI) techniques, which involve open-ended questions, reflective listening, and collaborative goal-setting, have been particularly effective in chronic wound management. These strategies empower patients, fostering a sense of control over their condition and encouraging proactive participation in their care.<xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0003-s2006"><title>Communication Barriers in Chronic Wound Management</title><p>Although communication is a cornerstone of effective chronic wound management, numerous barriers continue to impede its successful implementation in clinical practice. These obstacles may arise from both patient-related and systemic factors, ultimately compromising the quality of care and contributing to suboptimal clinical outcomes.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> One of the most significant challenges is low health literacy, which affects a patient&#8217;s ability to comprehend medical information, follow treatment instructions, and make informed decisions regarding their care. Individuals with limited health literacy may struggle to understand wound etiology, recognize signs of infection, or adhere to complex dressing protocols, thereby increasing the risk of delayed healing or wound deterioration. Compounding this issue are language differences between patients and healthcare providers, which can lead to misinterpretation of medical instructions or an inability to communicate symptoms effectively. These language barriers are particularly pronounced in multicultural settings, where access to professional medical interpreters may be limited or inconsistent.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Cultural beliefs and values also play a critical role in shaping patient perceptions of illness and treatment. In some cultures, wounds may be viewed as a sign of spiritual imbalance, or traditional remedies may be favored over biomedical interventions. When healthcare providers fail to acknowledge or respectfully address these beliefs, it can result in reduced patient engagement, mistrust, and non-adherence to prescribed treatment regimens.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Furthermore, disparities in access to digital communication tools&#8212;such as telemedicine platforms, patient portals, or mHealth applications&#8212;can exacerbate communication challenges, particularly among older adults, individuals with limited technological literacy, or those living in resource-constrained settings. The digital divide restricts opportunities for timely follow-up, remote monitoring, and educational outreach, thereby limiting continuity of care and coordinated wound management.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><p>Addressing these barriers requires a multifaceted approach that includes the use of plain language in patient education, culturally tailored communication strategies, access to professional interpreters, and initiatives to bridge the digital divide. By recognizing and mitigating these challenges, healthcare providers can enhance communication effectiveness, promote patient engagement, and improve outcomes in chronic wound care.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><sec id="s0003-s2006-s3001"><title>Health Literacy Challenges</title><p>Health literacy plays a foundational role in the effective management of chronic wounds, yet it remains a pervasive challenge across diverse patient populations. Defined as the ability to access, understand, and utilize health information to make appropriate healthcare decisions, health literacy is particularly critical for conditions requiring complex self-management, such as chronic wounds. Evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of patients with chronic wounds exhibit limited health literacy, impairing their ability to comprehend clinical instructions, implement wound care protocols correctly, and recognize the early signs of complications.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This limitation often leads to adverse outcomes, including delayed wound healing, increased risk of infection, and more frequent hospital admissions.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p><p>Patients with low health literacy may misinterpret prescription labels, inadequately apply or change dressings, or be unable to distinguish between normal wound healing and pathological changes such as increased exudate, odor, or tissue necrosis. Inadequate understanding can also result in non-adherence to follow-up appointments, misuse of prescribed medications, and a lack of engagement in preventive strategies, further complicating wound care and recovery. These challenges are compounded by comorbidities often present in individuals with chronic wounds, such as diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease, which themselves require nuanced management and patient education.<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p><p>Addressing health literacy barriers necessitates a deliberate, multifaceted approach that emphasizes clarity, repetition, and patient empowerment. Healthcare providers must tailor their communication methods to accommodate individual patient needs, taking into account language proficiency, cognitive ability, and cultural context.
