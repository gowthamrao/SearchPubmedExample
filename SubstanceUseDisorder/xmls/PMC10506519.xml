Recurrent tonsillar infections and tonsillar hypertrophy are the most prevalent reasons for tonsillectomy procedures because the tonsils act as a septic focus and obstruct the upper airway (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In the last decades, with advancements in anesthetic and surgical methods, fatality incidents resulting from tonsillectomy have declined. But still, tonsillectomy is accompanied by severe complications, including pain, hemorrhage, and dietary restrictions (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). New techniques and tools have been introduced to avoid and reduce these comorbidities and complications. The majority of these techniques, such as cold-steel dissection, monopolar electrocautery (ME), bipolar electrocautery (BE), coblation, laser dissection, and thermal welding system (TW) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), work by applying a variety of energy sources to denature the muscles and tissues and block the blood vessels outside of the typical coagulation pathways (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These approaches have been examined and contrasted in children, adults, and both; nonetheless, TW and ME are currently the most applied approaches (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Undertaking a tonsillectomy with TW is an innovative approach. It depends on using temperature, pressure, and time to seal vessels. It depends on applying heat and pressure to block blood vessels. The instrument has a heat source in one arm powered by a low-voltage current set between 300 and 400 degrees Celsius. This heat source is forced against an opposing arm to generate the ideal pressure for tissue fusing and dividing. Additionally, the fusing and dividing process of the tissues is accompanied by evaporation along the constrained area in touch with the heat source (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The latest research that evaluated the effectiveness of this novel method discovered that TW caused only minimal tissue damage. These investigations presented TW as a secure approach to tonsillectomy procedures. Additionally, they showed that it shortened the operation duration and provided adequate hemostasis during surgery and tissue dissection (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>ME is among the new techniques used for tonsillectomy. ME abrades structures and tissues around the tonsils by producing an electric discharge between the tissue and the ME. It sections tissues at 400 &#176;C or above. It coagulates vasculature and separates the tissue holding the tonsil to the underneath pharyngeal constrictor muscles by applying high heat to the tonsillar region. Its use is complicated with issues relating to postoperative comorbidities, including thermal damage to adjacent structures. Thermal injury to the pillar mucosal layer might delay healing and aggravate late problems involving postoperative bleeding and pain (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Despite the various advantages offered by the current procedures and technologies, there still has to be clarity on the approach and technology that will result in the least amount of postoperative discomfort and the highest level of safety in tonsillectomy (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In hopes of contributing to the decision about the best surgical option in tonsillectomy, we performed this work to compare the effectiveness and safety of the TW and ME tonsillectomy in terms of postoperative pain, postoperative bleeding, and operation time in patients undergoing for tonsillectomy to determine which procedure is most expected to enhance the postoperative quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We adopted the Cochrane Handbook guidelines for Systematic Reviews, besides the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

TW showed lower postoperative pain levels than ME statistically but without achieving significant clinical advantage. Also, ME showed lower operative duration than TW statistically but without achieving significant clinical advantage. Since TW is more costly than ME and the utilization of the TW did not provide any apparent benefits over ME in tonsillectomy, we suggest that the cost factor should be considered when choosing one of these two procedures (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>ME and TW both have the drawback of applying high heat, which might harm the adjacent mucosa and the muscle tissue, and lead to pharynx spasms (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, TW contains an insulating component to minimize tissue injury when utilizing this technique (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This may result in reduced tissue injury to the pharynx muscles, pharynx spasms, as well as postoperative pain. These results aligned with our study, as the TW technique reduced postoperative pain more than ME. Comparing TW to other hot-tonsillectomy methods, Sanl&#305; et al. (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) also concluded it to be a reliable approach in terms of tissue injury.</p><p>Comparing the TW and BE procedures, Karatzias et al. (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) discovered that the TW group experienced substantially less pain and no thermal harm to the nearby structures. In the BE arm, they also found a small amount of peritonsillar and uvula edema. Yet, according to Cunningham and Chio (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), there was no substantial statistical variation in pain levels between electrocautery and TW.</p><p>A previous investigation on tonsil bed healing and the extent of the necrosis showed that the TW group performed substantially better than the ME group (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These findings are consistent with those of Ozkiri&#351; et al. (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) who found that the TW group had greater re-epithelization of the tonsillar fossae than the BE dissection approach provided. The amount of thermal tissue injury and pain levels were connected and found to be considerably lower in the TW group. Consequently, analysis of the thermal tissue injury can provide insight into the likely level of postoperative pain that patients will experience after any tonsillectomy approach and affects when patients are discharged from the hospital and how much the procedure costs overall.</p><p>Concerning postoperative bleeding, our gathered analysis revealed no substantial variation between the ME and TW techniques in tonsillectomy. According to Hinton-Bayre et al. (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), who reviewed the methods employed by consulting surgeons, there was no substantial variation in secondary post-tonsillectomy bleeding between the trial arms. Additionally, the authors highlighted that as a contributing factor to bleeding, surgeon experience was possibly more crucial than the technology of the tools utilized in these surgeries. According to a prior trial, however, the TW technique could cause fewer bleeding concerns than conventional tonsillectomy techniques (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In this study, the authors demonstrated that whereas there were no cases of hemorrhage in the TW arm, three individuals in the ME arm experienced late hemorrhage. The small sample size still restricts the results of this study, and large-scale confirming RCTs are required to verify the safety of TW.</p><p>TW had the greatest rate of return to the operating room for the management of secondary hemorrhage and the greatest degrees of pain. Whereas the observed extent of the injury was less severe than that of coblation, this result could be due to the high operating temperatures for TW (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, when comparing coblation with the laser technique, a recent pooled analysis revealed no substantial variation between the coblation and the laser procedures in terms of postoperative pain and bleeding (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the duration of the operations, we found a significant difference between the TW and ME techniques (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Another trial also found that using TW resulted in prolonged operating times (p&lt;0.001). When total anesthetic times were compared, however, this did not result in a statistically significant extension of intraoperative time, and hence, did not result in an increase in cost (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Although the majority of otorhinolaryngologists are aware that several modern devices used in tonsillectomy -those used for coblation and TW, for instance- are substantially more costly than those used for ME, the increased operating time had the highest impact on cost (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Another study, supporting these findings, reported a significant increase in operation times and costs in TW compared to ME (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Yet, there is a lack in the literature concerning the cost of these new techniques. Even the few studies that discussed the cost need to be updated, as they were conducted more than 10 years ago. For example, in 2003, TW forceps cost was estimated to be approximately &#8364;280/US$340. These forceps were single-use Bayonet UltraSlim instruments (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This finding was cost-effective in some investigations as the single-use protects against Creutzfeldt&#8211;Jakob disease transmission (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, a study conducted in the Turkish population in 2013 reported that the main disadvantage of TW was the cost of the procedure, which was significantly higher than those of BE and classic dissection techniques, as the cost of TW forceps was about US$310 at that time in Turkey (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The results of this pooled analysis provide new information. However, some of its drawbacks necessitate caution when generalizing its findings. The inability to assess publication bias and the short postoperative follow-up times are two of these drawbacks. The low number of eligible studies mainly contributed to these limitations. The included studies also revealed a discrepancy in demographic traits depending on whether the group was made up of adults or children, which could introduce bias. Histopathologic characterization of the extent of injury of TW was lacking, and further research involving a larger patient group is required to thoroughly explore the substantial variations between TW and ME.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pooled analysis revealed that postoperative bleeding for tonsillectomy were similar between the ME and TW techniques. TW showed lower postoperative pain levels than ME statistically, but without achieving significant clinical advantage. Also, ME showed lower operative duration than TW statistically but without achieving significant clinical advantage. Since the TW technique is costlier than the ME and the utilization of TW did not provide any apparent benefits over ME in tonsillectomy, we suggest that the cost factor should be considered when choosing one of these two procedures. Additional well-designed RCTs with greater sample sizes are needed to fully understand and comparatively assess the morbidity rates associated with ME and TW in tonsillectomy.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>
