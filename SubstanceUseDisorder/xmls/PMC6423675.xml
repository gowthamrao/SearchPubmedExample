disease (CKD) is an increasingly prevalent condition in Australia, placing a
significant burden on the health budget and on the affected individuals
themselves. Yet, there are relatively limited data on the prevalence of CKD
within Australian general practice patients. In part, this could be due to
variation in the terminology used by general practitioners (GPs) to identify and
document a diagnosis of CKD. This project sought to investigate the variation in
terms used when recording a diagnosis of CKD in general practice.
<bold>Methods:</bold> A search of routinely collected de-identified
Australian general practice patient data (NPS MedicineWise MedicineInsight from
January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2016; collected from 329 general practices) was
conducted to determine the terms used. Manual searches were conducted on coded
and on &#8220;free-text&#8221; or narrative information in the medical history, reason for
encounter, and reason for prescription data fields. <bold>Results:</bold> From
this data set, 61 102 patients were potentially diagnosable with CKD on the
basis of pathology results, but only 14 172 (23.2%) of these had a term
representing CKD in their electronic record. Younger patients with pathology
evidence of CKD were more likely to have documented CKD compared with older
patients. There were a total of 2090 unique recorded documentation terms used by
the GPs for CKD. The most commonly used terms tended to be those included as
&#8220;pick-list&#8221; options within the various general practice software packages&#8217;
standard &#8220;classifications,&#8221; accounting for 84% of use. <bold>Conclusions:</bold>
A diagnosis of CKD was often not documented and, when recorded, it was in a
variety of ways. While recording CKD with various terms and in free-text fields
may allow GPs to flexibly document disease qualifiers and enter patient specific
information, it might inadvertently decrease the quality of data collected from
general practice records for clinical audit or research purposes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>electronic health records</kwd><kwd>documentation</kwd><kwd>terminology</kwd><kwd>classification</kwd><kwd>coding</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2150132719833298"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing worldwide health problem and affects

the development of a longitudinal database in which patients within sites can be
tracked over time. We used MedicineInsight data from January 1, 2013, to June 01,
2016, collected from 329 general practices. Regular patients (defined by the Royal
Australian College of General Practitioners as those with 3 or more encounters in 2
years) were included if at the time of data extraction (July 2016) they were aged at
least 18 years. Patients were determined as &#8220;diagnosable&#8221; with CKD if they had 2 or
more estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) recorded values less than 60
mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and/or 2 urinary albumin/creatinine ratios &#8805;3.5 mg/mmol

practice&#8212;ranging from an absence of recording (in more than three-quarters of
patients) through to the use of multiple clinical terms. Variation related to both
differing and numerous terms within clinical software packages and the use of
free-text by GPs. With the various clinical information system available in
Australian general practice, GPs can use medical coding vocabularies to register
diagnosis, reason for encounter, and reason for prescription into their systems.
Although GPs are required to complete all these fields every time they see a
patient, the use of the codes is not mandatory and clinicians can enter medical
terms as free-text.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>There was an association between age of the patient and having a recorded diagnosis

years.</p><p>The challenges in the use of electronic medical records, intended to assist in the
delivery and documentation of care in clinical practice, when applied for quality
improvement and research purposes have been well characterized in Australia and
internationally. Symptom lists may be incomplete, diagnoses may vary in their
accuracy, and accessing data can be difficult when outcomes or conditions are
recorded without a standard nomenclature or when details are entered in progress
notes or other text fields not readily accessible for data queries.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr16-2150132719833298" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This is not only a research
problem but also a clinical issue. Clinical information systems generally provide
users with add-on clinical audit tools. However, the algorithms in these clinical
audit tools are based on GPs using drop-down options when recording a patient
diagnosis. So, if a GP uses a free-text term or misspells their term, a clinical
audit tool would not &#8220;find&#8221; this term/patient.</p><p>If GPs only used the pick-list options within the various clinical software packages&#8217;
standard classifications, the variation between the packages would not be an issue
if all the packages&#8217; codes were collected. However, having too many codes does make
it hard to extract, and still misses instances of CKD. More sophisticated extraction
procedures across multiple data fields in addition to searching free-text entries,
as in this study, can minimize some of these limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank NPS MedicineWise for providing the data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the
