Indeed, it varies among patients treated in the same hospital system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> or by the same clinician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="Par9">Recent studies suggest that quality of opioid analgesic (OA) prescribing may also vary by insurance type. Patterns of OA prescribing such as high-risk or potentially inappropriate prescribing and rapid discontinuation are considered potential indicators of poor quality, given their association with harms including an increased risk of overdose, development of opioid use disorder, poorer health outcomes, and a greater likelihood of remaining out of the workforce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> High-risk OA prescribing, such as initial prescriptions &gt;7 days or &gt;90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME), varies by insurance status: compared to the commercially insured, Medicaid and self-pay patients experience high-risk prescribing at higher rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Compared to commercially insured patients, Medicaid enrollees and self-pay patients receiving long-term opioids are more likely to have episodes rapidly discontinued.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Self-pay patients on long-term opioids are also less likely to receive naltrexone co-prescriptions&#160;compared to those with insurance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p><p id="Par10">Some variability in opioid prescribing patterns likely reflects differences in <italic toggle="yes">where</italic> patients receive care&#8212;e.g., in&#160;health systems or from prescribers more likely to provide lower quality opioid care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> For example, approximately 1% of prescribers account for 49% of all opioid doses prescribed in the US, and they commonly prescribe higher opioid doses than recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Some clinicians are also more likely to prescribe high-risk opioids than others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> even when working in the same health system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="Par11">However, OA prescribing quality may vary because prescribers treat patients with different insurance statuses differently. A study of access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder for pregnant individuals found significant variation within the same practice based on insurance status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> However, we are unaware of studies examining to what extent insurance status may influence the quality of OA prescribing by the same clinician or what the characteristics are of clinicians more likely to prescribe differently based on insurance status.</p><p id="Par12">To address this gap in the literature, we used national pharmacy claims from approximately 90% of US retail pharmacies to conduct an exploratory analysis identifying prescribers treating at least twenty individuals with OA prescriptions during the period January 2017 through December 2018. We examined to what extent prescribers may have different rates of high-risk OA prescribing to patient populations with different insurance statuses. We also examined provider specialty and its association with high-risk prescribing to patients with different insurance statuses. State, federal, and local stakeholders seeking to decrease high-risk OA prescribing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> need to know if prescribers prescribe differently based on a&#160;patient&#8217;s insurance status.

The data include information on the prescription, payer, some patient demographics, prescriber specialty and location, each dispensed prescription&#8217;s natural drug code, dosage, quantity, and days&#8217; supply. Patients have unique identifiers enabling researchers to identify prescriptions dispensed to that individual across pharmacies. We excluded buprenorphine formulations (e.g., suboxone) primarily used to treat opioid use disorder.</p><p id="Par14">We defined new treatment episodes as the first observed date of a dispensed opioid prescription following a period of at least 60 days after the days&#8217; supply of any prior dispensed opioid prescription had run out. An episode lasted through the last day of the supply for the last dispensed opioid prescription, with no more than a 60-day gap between the last day supply of one prescription and the subsequent prescription being dispensed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We limited our sample to episodes from prescribers who wrote OA prescriptions for at least twenty individuals during the 2 years. We categorized each episode by payer and prescriber of the first prescription and identified three groups of prescribers: prescribers with (1) &#8805; 10 commercial insurance episodes and &#8805; 10 Medicaid episodes; (2) &#8805; 10 commercial insurance episodes and &#8805; 10 self-pay episodes; and (3) &#8805; 10 Medicaid episodes and &#8805; 10 self-pay episodes. We label these provider groups respectively as (1) Medicaid/commercial, (2) commercial/self-pay, and (3) Medicaid/self-pay. A prescriber could be in more than one payer dyad.

Such high-risk prescribing was more common for self-pay patients than for commercially insured and Medicaid-enrolled patients among clinicians treating both patient populations, suggesting that the relationship between insurance status and quality of prescribing OAs goes beyond where patients receive care. This differential prescribing may stem from factors such as patient education or patient demographics not captured in the data. Nonetheless, our study suggests that insurance type itself is a marker for risk of lower quality opioid care. Prior studies have shown that access to health insurance improves opioid-related health outcomes, probably reflecting access to opioid use disorder treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> We found that access to insurance&#8212;either Medicaid or commercial&#8212;is associated with safer initial prescribing of OAs.</p><p id="Par27">We found that self-pay patients had more high-risk opioid episodes than Medicaid or commercial patients but can only hypothesize about the reason. Clinicians may alter their practices due to clinical differences among populations, implicit or explicit bias, or misaligned financial incentives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> For example, commercially insured patients may have fewer high-risk opioid episodes because they are receiving other treatments, such as surgery or physical therapy. These patients may be more likely than Medicaid patients to receive such interventions because of higher reimbursement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> or because such procedures may be prohibitively expensive for self-pay patients. Patients who cannot afford alternative treatments may be more reliant on opioids, and it may be more cost-effective for such patients to receive a shorter course of higher dose opioids than a longer course of lower dose opioids. Clinicians may be responding to these realities.</p><p id="Par28">Unbalanced prescribing may reflect prescribing restrictions for patients with commercial and Medicaid insurance but not for self-pay. Alternatively, because many commercial insurers and Medicaid programs monitor and track opioid prescriptions using pharmacy claims,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> some individuals who self-pay for opioids may be seeking to evade or circumvent such efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> It is also possible that self-pay patients who received an initial episode &gt;7 days were in fact on long-term opioids but had gaps in prescriptions because they were unable to pay for medications. Finally, prescribers themselves may also suggest self-payment to evade the need for prior authorization or prescription monitoring.</p><p id="Par29">Studies show that high-risk prescribing varies by clinician type and characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> However, results are mixed regarding which prescriber specialties are more likely to write high-risk prescriptions. Fink and colleagues found patients of nurse practitioners (NP) or naturopathic medicine clinicians received more high risk opioids prescriptions than patients seen by other clinician types. However, these high-risk&#160;prescriptions were actually written by prescribers in different disciplines (i.e., not their NP or naturopathic medicine clinician). These patients were just more likely to have multiple prescribers, and the authors concluded that variability was due to patient rather than prescriber characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> A study of post-surgical opioid prescribing found APPs were more likely to prescribe opioids &gt;30 days than physicians across all surgical specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> By contrast, studies in the emergency department found that APPs were less likely to prescribe high-risk opioids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> Another study found PCPs were more likely to prescribe opioids than specialists, but surgeons and hospital-based specialists prescribed higher doses than PCPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> However, no prior work has examined the extent to which individual clinicians prescribe differently to different patients.</p><p id="Par30">We found that pain physicians had greater odds of being unbalanced prescribers than PCPs. Patients seeking care with pain specialists may have chronic, more complex pain than patients seeing other prescribers. However, it is possible that self-pay patients who obtain care from pain specialists differ clinically from commercially insured or Medicaid-enrolled individuals receiving such care. For example, self-pay patients may present to pain care clinicians later in the course of their illness, potentially contributing to higher rates of high-dose opioids or longer prescriptions observed in self-pay individuals.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par31">Our study has several limitations. We have no clinical information about individuals filling opioid prescriptions. Without clinical information, we do not know to what extent the high-risk prescribing is appropriate (e.g., palliative treatment), or whether clinical differences are driving variation between populations. We have no information about opioids dispensed from pharmacies not included in the IQVIA data, or information about other services received by individuals filling opioid prescriptions, including non-pharmacologic interventions for pain management. We have no information about the clinical settings in which prescribers practice. Many clinicians work in multiple settings, potentially treating individuals with different insurance in different settings, thereby influencing opioid prescribing. Finally, although we have developed a concrete, robust, and reproducible method for classifying providers as unbalanced, the approach is novel, and we therefore cannot compare our characterizations with those used elsewhere. Future research examining such characterizations is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p id="Par32">Our study enhances understanding of potentially high-risk prescribing of OAs. The same clinicians prescribed OAs differently to different populations of patients. Over 1 in 10 prescribers in each of the dyads exhibited unbalanced prescribing patterns based on insurance type, and self-pay patients were particularly at risk for receiving high-risk opioid episodes. Our findings may reflect barriers to access to care for patients without insurance, clinician efforts to limit out-of-pocket costs to uninsured patients, or limitations of current opioid prescribing monitoring systems. Our findings warrant further examination of how the structure of the US health system may contribute to disparate high-risk prescribing. Specifically, we need a better understanding of the extent to which our findings reflect barriers to access to care for patients without insurance and clinician efforts to limit out-of-pocket costs to uninsured patients. These results may also reflect the limitations of current opioid prescribing monitoring systems and the need for them to better capture patients who pay out-of-pocket for their medications. Our findings may further support the need for health insurance expansion and additional policy interventions to address the disparities observed in potentially high-risk opioid prescribing by the same clinician to different populations of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec10"><p>

<bold>Lay Summary</bold>
</p><p>Insurance status may influence the quality of opioid prescribing even among patients seen by the same clinician. High-risk opioid prescriptions, such as initial prescriptions &gt;7 days or &gt;90 morphine milligram equivalents, are associated with harms and may be markers of low-quality opioid prescribing. We used national pharmacy data to ask if patients seeing the same clinician were more or less likely to receive prescriptions for high-risk opioids based on their insurance type. We found this was more likely in self-pay patients than either Medicaid or commercial pay patients even when seeing the same clinician. We found that over 1 in 10 clinicians prescribed in a significantly different way to patients with different insurance types. Pain specialists were the most likely to prescribe differently based on insurance type. The relationship between insurance status and quality of prescribing to individuals receiving opioids goes beyond where patients receive care.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Contributors</italic>: The authors would like to thank Mary Vaiana for her thoughtful edits and Hilary Peterson for assistance with manuscript preparation.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funders</title><p>Open access funding provided by SCELC, Statewide California Electronic Library Consortium.
