We used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) and the Guidelines International Network&#8217;s Principles for Disclosure of Interests and Management of Conflicts to ensure the guideline met international standards for transparency, high quality and methodological rigour.

A national guideline committee with a broad range of expertise &#8212; including clinicians, researchers, people with lived and living experience of alcohol use, and people who self-identified as Indigenous or M&#233;tis &#8212; was assembled to select priority topics, review the evidence and develop the recommendations.</p><p>The full guideline is available in Appendix 1 (at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.230715/tab-related-content" ext-link-type="uri">www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.230715/tab-related-content</ext-link>) and includes comprehensive evidence summaries for each recommendation, along with practice tools and implementation tips.

<bold>Certainty of evidence</bold>
</p><p>Initial estimates of certainty are based on a traditional hierarchy of evidence, whereby meta-analyses of RCTs are assigned the highest score, followed by individual clinical trials, quasi- or non-randomized trials, observational studies and reports, and expert opinion, which is assigned the lowest score. Factors that lowered confidence in the estimated effect of an intervention included risk of bias, inconsistency across the RCTs, indirectness and publication bias; factors that increased confidence included large effect sizes and an observed dose&#8211;response effect. The final certainty ratings are reflective of the estimated effect of an intervention, as reported in the literature, with consideration of biases and limitations of the evidence base as identified by the guideline committee, as described below:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>High:</bold> Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Moderate:</bold> Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Low:</bold> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Very low:</bold> Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p></list-item></list><p>

We rated the certainty of evidence for this recommendation as high, based on multiple meta-analyses and RCTs showing the harms related to benzodiazepine use, potential for nonmedical use, and documentation of the serious adverse effects and events, including falls and injuries.<xref rid="b49-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="b50-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> We rated this recommendation as strong, given guideline committee consensus and known possible harms of benzodiazepine use among people with and without AUD.<xref rid="b49-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="b50-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The guideline development was overseen by a steering committee based within the Canadian Research Initiative on Substance Misuse (CRISM), a national network composed of 5 regional nodes across Canada. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II)<xref rid="b51-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> to ensure the guideline met international standards for transparency, high quality and methodological rigour. Guideline development followed the ADAPTE process, <xref rid="b52-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> building upon a pre-existing British Columbia guideline.<xref rid="b53-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> We used the GRADE tool<xref rid="b15-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> to score recommendations (<xref rid="bx3-195e1364" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>).</p><p>Guideline development activities were supported by grant funding from Health Canada&#8217;s Substance Use and Addictions Program (2021-HQ-000066). The guideline was also supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding to CRISM, and the BC Centre on Substance Use provided in-kind support. The guideline was developed between December 2020 and July 2023.</p><sec><title>Composition of participating groups</title><p>The steering committee comprised the co-chairs of the Canadian Alcohol Use Disorder Guideline Committee (E.W., J.R.), an associated program director (J.W.G.R.), a guideline development manager (N.G.), a guideline coordinator (A.H.) and 2 medical writers (J.B., K.H.).</p><p>The interdisciplinary guideline committee of 36 individuals was assembled via outreach conducted by the CRISM Node Managers and Node Principal Investigators in December 2020. The committee included representation from across Canada, with expertise spanning addiction medicine, family practice, evidence-based medicine, mental health, social work, nursing, pharmacy, recovery-oriented systems of care, health care administration and policy. Additionally, the committee included 4 people who self-identified as Indigenous or M&#233;tis and 11 people with lived and living experience of alcohol use. Three working groups were developed to focus on screening, diagnosis and brief intervention; withdrawal management; and treatment and ongoing care.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of priority topics</title><p>The overarching principles, outline, scope and contents of the guideline were approved by consensus of the full committee upon discussion of the content of the British Columbia Guideline and integrating suggestions from committee members. A full list of research questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in Appendix 1, Section A1.4.</p></sec><sec><title>Literature review and quality assessment</title><p>We performed an updated systematic literature search in September 2020 using the same search strategies employed in the BC AUD guideline.<xref rid="b53-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In brief, a contracted information specialist performed literature searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Ovid; and CINAHL and PsycINFO via EBSCOHost. We screened only new results not previously identified for the BC AUD guideline for inclusion. Two staff medical writers (including J.B.) independently screened and identified eligible studies. Discordance between reviewers on inclusion or exclusion of individual studies was resolved through discussion. An experienced reviewer (J.B.) used validated assessment tools (e.g., A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews, version 2 [AMSTAR-2], Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Downs and Black checklist) to evaluate study quality. <xref rid="b54-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> We also conducted a targeted search in May 2022 to examine questions related to polypharmacy in AUD.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of recommendations</title><p>We updated evidence summaries from the BC AUD guideline<xref rid="b53-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> with newly identified literature and shared them with the relevant working groups. Each working group determined through consensus whether the recommendations should be accepted without modification, adapted or removed. Working groups conferred over email and video conference between December 2020 and December 2022.</p><p>Once the working groups approved the wording and grading of the recommendations and supporting text for their respective sections, we compiled and circulated them for review to the full committee. Subsequently, a committee meeting was held in December 2022 to discuss the feedback, which we then incorporated into a revised draft. The committee approved the revisions by consensus before external review.</p></sec><sec><title>External review</title><p>We circulated the draft guideline for review and comment to 13 relevant experts and stakeholders from Canada and international jurisdictions in January 2023. Expertise among external reviewers included addiction medicine, psychiatry, psychology, evidence-based medicine and Indigenous health. All external reviewers completed disclosure of competing interest forms before review. A staff medical writer (K.H.) incorporated feedback from the external reviewers &#8212; including clarity on screening tool validation, greater emphasis and description of psychosocial treatment interventions, and clearer presentation of recommendations &#8212; into a revised guideline. We then recirculated the final document to the full committee for final review, comment and sign off by consensus. The composition of the external reviewer panel is listed in Appendix 1, Authors and Contributors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Management of competing interests</title><p>In keeping with Guidelines International Network&#8217;s Principles for Disclosure of Interests and Management of Conflicts,<xref rid="b55-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> committee members were required to disclose competing interests in November 2020 and May 2023. The guideline&#8217;s Competing Interest Adjudicator (N.G., with support from the co-chairs) did not deem any of the potential direct or indirect conflicts of interest to be of sufficient relevance or weight to warrant exclusion from the committee. In brief, no committee members disclosed direct monetary or nonmonetary support from alcohol or pharmaceutical industry sources within the past 5 years, or that their clinical revenue would be influenced by the guideline recommendations.</p><p>To mitigate any real, potential or perceived risk of bias, 1 committee member who disclosed a direct potential competing interest involving employment with an addiction treatment organization was recused from voting on relevant recommendations. Additionally, 15 people disclosed special interests in relation to the guideline, pertaining to specific expertise, clinical experience, advisory board membership for nonprofit or community organizations, or research interests and publications, but the Competing Interest Adjudicator did not judge these to represent competing interests that precluded these individuals&#8217; participation in committee activities.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>The release of this guideline follows the recent publication of <italic toggle="yes">Canada&#8217;s Guidance on Alcohol and Health</italic>,<xref rid="b2-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and it is hoped that both of these guidelines will collectively help to address the overall harms attributable to alcohol in Canada. In most Canadian jurisdictions, the lack of resources dedicated to care of substance use disorders, as well as the dearth of provincial or national comprehensive guidelines, have likely hindered the implementation of evidence-based treatments for AUD.</p><p>National and regional health policy-makers can substantially improve standards of care by promoting the adoption of this guideline and its recommendations. An example of a policy action that would facilitate providers in offering evidence-based medications would be to apply standard benefit status to all AUD medications on regional formularies, rather than requiring any form of special authorization.</p><p>With available resources, CRISM is pursuing a knowledge translation strategy to educate primary care providers, including efforts to track and measure implementation. Nevertheless, investments to reduce structural barriers (e.g., lack of physician training in addiction medicine) require policy-maker attention.<xref rid="b7-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Implementation efforts should also include low-barrier access points, as people with AUD, particularly those from marginalized communities, face multiple barriers to entering the traditional health care system.</p><p>Evidence for addressing high-risk drinking and AUD continues to evolve, and this guideline will be updated periodically as new knowledge becomes available.</p></sec><sec><title>Other guidelines</title><p>Several guidelines related to the management of high-risk alcohol use and AUD have been published in the last 5 years (<xref rid="t4-195e1364" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

Additionally, studies of psychosocial interventions have not used consistent approaches, durations or outcomes, making it difficult to determine the optimal strategies and lengths. Similarly, certain at-risk populations (e.g., incarcerated populations) and community-based approaches (e.g., residential treatment) have not received sufficient research attention and have not been studied in RCTs.</p><p>Most clinical trials have relatively small sample sizes and short-term durations (e.g., 8 weeks), with clinically relevant outcomes often not considered. For instance, in a systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials of SSRIs for depression reporting intermediate-term follow-up, the authors aimed to examine the impact of SSRI therapy on heavy drinking days and found that less than 10% of trials reported on alcohol use.<xref rid="b61-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Although there is a relatively high degree of consistent findings across naltrexone and acamprosate trials,<xref rid="b18-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> studies of SSRIs are highly heterogenous, potentially as a result of underlying biases described elsewhere.<xref rid="b62-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Additionally, given that medications alone are unlikely to be effective in many instances of AUD, the role of commonly prescribed medications (e.g., naltrexone, SSRI) in potentially augmenting or undermining psychosocial treatment interventions similarly deserves further study.<xref rid="b63-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="b64-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></p><p>Finally, although meta-analyses suggest that certain psychotherapies or anticraving medications have good evidence for surrogate outcomes (e.g., preventing return to alcohol use),<xref rid="b18-195e1364" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> fewer studies include clinically relevant and longer-term health outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality).</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation to the development process was the length of time between the initial literature search (September 2020) and the publication of this guideline. However, committee and reviewer comments often fuelled targeted literature searches that garnered more recent results, which were included in the text. In addition, a single individual assessed the quality of the included studies.</p><p>Importantly, the scope did not include comprehensive guidance for AUD with co-occurring substance use disorders or AUD comorbid with severe mental health conditions. Here, we suggest specialty consultation where available. Finally, although we developed a committee well positioned to identify and address the needs of primary care providers and the broad needs and perspectives of people affected by high-risk drinking and AUD, certain groups &#8212; including immigrant and refugee populations &#8212; were not represented.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Owing to the severe underutilization of evidence-based treatment approaches for high-risk drinking and AUD in Canada, in this guideline we promote expanded access to the full range of evidence-based treatments, including AUD pharmacotherapies (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate) and psychosocial and mental health interventions, while also seeking to address the common occurrence of ineffective and potentially harmful prescribing and other practices. The aim of this guideline is to support primary care providers and services to offer more effective treatments routinely to patients with AUD as the standard of practice, with resulting improvements in health as well as potential for considerable cost savings in health and social systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Appendix 1 - Full guideline</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="230715-guide-1-at.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="PMC_2" content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Figure 1 - Accesible version</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="230715-guide-f1-text-only.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful to all 36 committee members for their involvement as subject matter experts, the external peer reviewers, Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse staff involved in the production of this guideline, Christa Ledding for her graphic design work and Maryam Babaei for assistance with article screening.
