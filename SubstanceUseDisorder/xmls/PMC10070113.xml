We previously demonstrated that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has a weight-independent effect on glucose homeostasis and transiently reduces food intake. In this study we investigate the effects of RYGB on diurnal eating behavior as well as on the molecular clock and this clock&#8217;s requirement for the metabolic effects of this bariatric procedure in obese mice. We find that RYGB reversed the high-fat diet&#8211;induced disruption in diurnal eating pattern during the early postsurgery phase of food reduction. Dark-cycle pair-feeding experiments improved glucose tolerance to the level of bypass-operated animals during the physiologic fasting phase (Zeitgeber time 2, ZT2) but not the feeding phase (ZT14). Using a clock gene reporter mouse model (<italic toggle="yes">mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic>), we reveal that RYGB induced a liver-specific phase shift in peripheral clock oscillation with no changes to the central clock activity within the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In addition, we show that weight loss effects were attenuated in obese <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice after RYGB that also failed to improve glucose metabolism after surgery, specifically hepatic glucose production. We conclude that RYGB reprograms the peripheral clock within the liver early after surgery to alter diurnal eating behavior and regulate hepatic glucose flux.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

The central clock, which is present within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is mainly entrained by light and synchronizes physiology and behavior to the environmental light/dark cycle. Outside the SCN, the peripheral clock is expressed in every mammalian cell, including the liver, where it is mainly entrained by food or energy availability, enabling synchronization of energy metabolism to fast&#8211;sleep/feed&#8211;wake cycles (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that the liver clock is necessary and sufficient to synchronize the rhythmicity of other peripheral clock tissues to feeding-related signals (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Environmental or genetic disruption in circadian rhythmicity promotes insulin resistance, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Bariatric surgery is now recognized to have an important role in management of morbid obesity and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, as it confers long-term protection from cardiovascular complications, compared with intensive medical therapy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In obese animal models, it was previously demonstrated that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) exerts a weight-independent effect on glucose homeostasis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We, and others, have consistently found that RYGB induces an increase in energy expenditure and a transient reduction in 24-hour food intake. However, no comprehensive investigation has been undertaken to examine circadian feeding behavior after bypass surgery (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Interestingly, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), another common bariatric procedure, was shown to exert the same weight loss, food reduction, and glucose regulatory effects in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice (homozygous deficiency in functional <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> gene expression controlling core clock machinery) as wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition, VSG does not seem to significantly alter either circadian eating behavior or clock expression, within the SCN or any of the peripheral tissues, except for the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Despite the initial similarities in weight loss response, gastric bypass has significant anatomical modifications that distinguish it from VSG. We recently described key differences between RYGB and VSG regarding their underlying molecular mechanisms for energy regulation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), where RYGB, but not VSG, engages the peripheral cannabinoid system to increase splanchnic nerve activity and induce thermogenesis in visceral mesenteric fat. Here, we aimed to examine the effects of RYGB on circadian feeding behavior, as well as clock gene rhythms in multiple metabolic tissues. Furthermore, we performed RYGB in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice to explore the involvement of the molecular clock machinery in the metabolic effects of RYGB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>RYGB transiently reverses the high-fat diet&#8211;induced alteration in the diurnal feeding pattern.</title><p>Diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice were placed on their preoperative high-fat diet (HFD) on day 8 after recovery from surgery.

Percentage of food intake during the dark cycle was increased in the RYGB-operated mice to the level of age-matched lean mice that were fed regular chow diet during this transient period of decrease in energy consumption (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pair-feeding to RYGB mice improves glucose tolerance during the fasting cycle.</title><p>When pair-fed (PF) during the physiologic eating diurnal cycle, these dark-cycle PF sham mice gained less weight than their ad libitum&#8211;fed counterparts in a 4-week period yet significantly more than RYGB mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, A and B; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166618DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166618DS1</ext-link>). Oral glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests (OGTTs and ITTs) were performed during week 2 (when body weights were similar) in dark-cycle PF sham and RYGB mice at 2 time points: Zeitgeber time 2 (ZT2; fasting phase) and ZT14 (feeding phase). Interestingly, dark-cycle PF sham mice exhibited similar glucose tolerance to RYGB mice during the fasting phase as shown by the OGTT curves of PF shams looking like the RYGB mice during ZT2 (fasting phase) but looking like the ad libitum&#8211;fed shams during ZT14 (feeding phase) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, dark-cycle PF sham mice showed an intermediate insulin sensitivity phenotype relative to RYGB and ad libitum&#8211;fed sham mice during ZT2 and ZT14 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RYGB induces a phase shift in hepatic clock gene oscillation but not in the SCN.</title><p>To determine the effect of gastric bypass on the molecular clock per se, we measured mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Period 1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Per1</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Period 2</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Per2</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">Cryptochrome 1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Cry1</italic>), and <italic toggle="yes">Cryptochrome 2</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Cry2</italic>) at 4 time points (or ZTs) across the sleep/wake cycle, in RYGB and sham-operated DIO C57BL/6J mice. <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Per1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Per2</italic> mRNA expression was significantly altered within the livers of RYGB-operated mice compared with their sham counterparts. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of any of the clock genes within the SCN between RYGB and sham mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To examine the effect of gastric bypass on the cell-autonomous circadian rhythms in isolated tissues, we performed RYGB in a <italic toggle="yes">Per2</italic> reporter mouse (<italic toggle="yes">mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) model fed either HFD or regular chow (CHOW) before assessing PER2 protein fused to luciferase (PER2:LUC) oscillations in several tissues on postoperative day 10, when RYGB and sham mice had similar body weights (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). A phase shift in hepatic clock gene (represented by <italic toggle="yes">Per2</italic>) was found in RYGB mice on either diet (HFD or CHOW). In the SCN, however, no changes were detected in the oscillation phase, period, amplitude, or damping, based on PER2:LUC rhythms. Although not statistically significant, mesenteric WAT (mWAT) showed a tendency toward phase advancement, while both mWAT and soleus muscle tissues exhibited a tendency for an attenuated period and wave amplitude post-RYGB that was diet independent (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RYGB-induced effects on energy balance are significantly attenuated in Clock<sup>&#916;19</sup> mice.</title><p>Next, we investigated the requirement of an intact molecular clock machinery for gastric bypass&#8211;induced metabolic effects by performing RYGB in DIO <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice and WT littermates.

There was also a loss of early changes in diurnal eating behavior as well as an increase in energy expenditure that is typically observed post-RYGB in WT DIO mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, C&#8211;G</xref>). In addition, even though RYGB had no effect on total locomotor activity during either light or dark cycle, <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice displayed a significant reduction in spontaneous locomotor activity during the dark cycle, compared with their WT littermates (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the initial reduction in the light cycle post-RYGB (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) was mainly due to reduction in meal size and meal frequency (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>, B and C), a phenomenon that was absent in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic>-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clock is required for RYGB-induced glucoregulatory changes.</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice failed to show improvement in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity post-RYGB, like what was observed in WT littermates (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A and B</xref>). The glucose homeostatic findings were further investigated using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. RYGB reduced endogenous glucose production and increased glucose disposal in the clamped (i.e., hyperinsulinemic) state. Interestingly, such effects were not present in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, C&#8211;F</xref>).

Furthermore, when tissue-specific glucose disposal post-RYGB was examined using a radiolabeled tracer, mWAT showed an increase in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in WT but not <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Finally, we examined whether the early change in circadian eating behavior and its associated improvement in glucose tolerance test results after gastric bypass (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) is associated with an alteration in hepatic glucose flux, independent of weight change, and whether the molecular clock is necessary for this early RYGB-induced effect. We performed a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice and WT littermates 2 weeks post-RYGB to study glucose flux in a weight-independent manner.

In addition, we demonstrate that this early change in energy consumption behavior is associated with improved oral glucose tolerance in the rest/fasting phase (ZT2). This latter finding was also weight independent, as the PF mice were similar in body weight to their bypass counterparts. Interestingly, RYGB mice exhibited higher peripheral insulin sensitivity than both PF and ad libitum&#8211;fed sham mice, suggesting that RYGB regulates glucose homeostasis at multiple levels. Furthermore, we did not find evidence that RYGB affects central clock expression or its ex vivo oscillation. Notably, even though RYGB induced some weight loss in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mouse, we find that the glucoregulatory effects of RYGB that were previously reported to be weight independent in rodents (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) are completely lost in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice. We further reveal that these early glucose homeostatic improvements seen post-RYGB reflect a decrease in endogenous hepatic production, again an effect that is lost in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutants.</p><p>Bariatric surgery has been available for decades and has been recognized as a foundation in the treatment of morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, an understanding of the mechanisms through which RYGB regulates glucose metabolism and other obesity-associated diseases could allow for development of less invasive targeted therapies. Two previous reports found no major effect of VSG, another common bariatric procedure, on circadian molecular rhythms or clock gene expression. Furthermore, the main energy and glucoregulatory effects of VSG were preserved in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice, suggesting that the molecular clock is not involved (or at least not required) for metabolic regulation post-VSG (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). On the other hand, VSG did alter transcriptional rhythms regulating lipid metabolism within WAT (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Despite their previously reported humoral similarities (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), RYGB and VSG have recently been recognized to exhibit several differences in their metabolic effects, at least in rodents (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Here we show that RYGB also diverges from VSG in its effect on circadian feeding behavior and molecular clock expression (specifically within the liver), which is associated with early reduction in hepatic glucose flux. The liver clock is the most sensitive of all peripheral tissues to entrainment by feeding cycles (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and it can also synchronize all other peripheral tissues to the eating behavior (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), while its rhythm is also responsive to insulin (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our present findings indicate that RYGB induces a transient early change in the diurnal eating rhythm, a change that is closely associated with changes in the phase shift in the hepatic clock and subsequently early reduction in hepatic glucose production. Remarkably, we also show that RYGB-operated animals that are on HFD synchronize their hepatic &#8220;clock&#8221; oscillation to a pattern similar to animals of regular CHOW diet (either sham or RYGB operated). This effect, interestingly, was weight independent (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). It has been suggested that the homeostatic glucose regulation following gastric bypass occurs at multiple levels, such as through increased secretion of incretins (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), improved pancreatic &#946; cell function and insulin secretion (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), as well as enhanced overall insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Our present findings indicate that one mechanism for the beneficial metabolic effects of RYGB may be to maintain the phase of the liver oscillator in synchrony with other oscillators. A previous rodent study showed that when rats were provided with a choice of chow versus HFD, RYGB-operated rats consumed more chow than HFD but fewer total calories overall during the dark cycle (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Remarkably, a small human study using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp early and late post-RYGB showed an early improvement in hepatic glucose secretion and hepatic insulin sensitivity 1 month after surgery, which is later followed by a more pronounced effect on glucose disposal (i.e., peripheral insulin sensitivity) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It is well recognized that humans with disrupted circadian rhythm, such as shift workers, are predisposed to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, and they appear to have an attenuated weight loss response to bariatric surgery when compared with controls (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We speculate that the early changes in hepatic glucose homeostasis that are associated with the diurnal eating behavior are likely due to the anatomical rearrangements of the surgery, which include changes in microbiome and bile acid flux and subsequent alteration in energy signals along the gut/brain or gut/liver axis. These changes are likely responsible for reprogramming of the peripheral hepatic clock, which is tightly associated with the alteration in diurnal feeding pattern. Moreover, we recently showed that diet-induced thermogenesis within WAT is tied to and dependent on adipocytes&#8217; <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This is highly supportive of our findings that RYGB failed to induce an increase in energy expenditure in the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mutant mice, a phenotype that was not present in the VSG model (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although our study disclosed that global functional deficiency of the molecular clock machinery significantly attenuates the RYGB-evoked energy and glucoregulatory changes, we have yet to determine if the hepatic clock alone (or in synchrony with the central/ hypothalamic clock) is necessary for the glucose homeostatic changes postsurgery. Our recent published data showing that a functional circadian clock within visceral WAT regulates time-restricted diet-induced thermogenesis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) combined with our attenuated energy expenditure data in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mice post-RYGB suggest that adipose tissue&#8217;s clock may be necessary for RYGB-induced energy balance. Finally, plenty of data in the literature, including a recent study, show that early-onset caloric restriction has a positive effect on longevity in male mice (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Large human cohorts and retrospective study analysis suggest that bariatric surgery decreases not only cancer and cardiovascular disease&#8211;related mortality but also all-cause mortality (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our study did not examine the effect of RYGB on longevity in this DIO mouse model, and despite RYGB-operated mice not maintaining a phenotype of reduced energy consumption as in humans, it would be interesting to examine the implications of this transient feeding restriction postsurgery on mice&#8217;s longevity in future studies.</p><p>On the other hand, we understand that the <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic><sup>&#916;19</sup> mouse model that we used in our experiments already expresses a metabolically abnormal phenotype of obesity, hyperglycemia, and lipidemia. However, other models of clock deficiency, such as <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>-knockout mice, are prone to obesity, which is exacerbated by HFD, but they are protected from hyperglycemia, lipidemia, and fatty liver and fibrosis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Using such a model would create a selection bias of an animal that does express the manifestation of hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia that exist in the DIO animal model mimicking the features of metabolic syndrome that is observed in obese humans.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that a normalized (time-restricted) feeding rhythm is a key factor in RYGB-induced early glucoregulatory response. Therefore, it may be important to monitor meal timing and other obesity-promoting abnormal circadian behaviors (such as frequent or late-night snacking) in patients with type 2 diabetes to ensure the best response to gastric bypass. Furthermore, the difference in response between VSG and RYGB in a model of a &#8220;broken&#8221; circadian rhythm (or deficient clock machinery) could represent an opportunity for health care providers managing obesity to select or avoid certain surgeries in patients with altered circadian behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RYGB surgeries of mice</title><p>All animals were given a weight-based dose of antibiotics (enrofloxacin) as prophylaxis for perioperative infection and analgesics (buprenorphine) for pain management before laparotomy. The surgical rearrangement of Roux-en-Y anatomy and the sham control were performed as described in our previous studies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). After removing hair with an electric razor, the abdomen skin was sterilized by 3 alternating scrubbings with betadine and 70% alcohol, then wiped with a betadine prep pad. Midline laparotomy was performed using forceps and scissors and extended from the xiphoid to umbilicus. The abdominal wall was entered using forceps and sterile cotton swabs. The distal transected jejunal limb is connected to the proximal anterior gastric wall and the proximal transected jejunal limb to the afferent Roux limb. The proximal gut was excluded from alimentary flow using a hemostasis clip (Ethicon Endosurgery) placed immediately distal to the gastro-jejunostomy. Closure was performed using 4&#8722;0 Vicryl (or PDS) with a running suture in the abdominal wall and interrupted sutures using 4&#8722;0 nylon + Vetbond Tissue adhesive glue in the skin. The sham procedure involved gastrotomy, enterotomy, and repair. All mice recovered from the stress of surgery in their home cages, with prophylactic injection of analgesics daily for the first 2 days and then on an as-needed basis. Mice were placed on liquid diet and supplemental intraperitoneal injections of dextrose fluid for hydration and nutrition during postoperative week 1. They were all allowed to recover on solid diet during postoperative week 2. Body weight was measured weekly.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Several groups of 15- to 16-week-old DIO C57BL/6J mice with an appropriate body weight (40&#8211;45 g) underwent RYGB versus sham surgery. Experiments were performed between postoperative weeks 1 and 6. Age-matched lean C57BL/6J males were used as controls. One group of mice was dedicated for 24-hour (12 hours/12 hours) diurnal food intake recordings for 5 weeks. A second group included a pair-feeding experiment where a group of DIO shams was PF day by day to the RYGB group, but food was provided only during the dark cycle. Weight change was tracked over 4 weeks. Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) were performed twice between weeks 1 and 2 during 2 ZTs. The first GTT was performed during the early light cycle (fasting phase), ZT2, and the second during the early dark cycle (feeding phase), ZT14. The 2 GTTs were separated by 72 hours. Similarly, ITTs were performed twice between week 1 and 2, at ZT2 and ZT14, 72 hours apart. Finally, a third large group of DIO C57BL/6J was generated to examine molecular clock gene expression in multiple tissues. Mice were sacrificed at ZT3, ZT9, ZT15, and ZT21 (6 weeks postintervention). mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Per1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Per2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cry1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Cry2</italic> genes was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (see <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Methods</xref>).

Two groups of <italic toggle="yes">mPer2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> knockin mice were placed on HFD until they reached a weight appropriate for surgery, at which time they underwent either RYGB or sham procedure as described above.

This group was called dark-cycle PF shams. Another group of ad libitum&#8211;fed shams were kept as control, also on HFD, in addition to the RYGB group.

Micro-renathane tubing (0.033&#8242;&#8242; inner diameter, Braintree catalog MRE033) was used to connect infusion pumps (Harvard Apparatus, catalog 704501) to the infusion catheter via a swivel (Instech, catalog 375/D/22QM) that allows free movement of the mouse. Mice were fasted for 5 hours prior to starting insulin and glucose infusion (time 0). <sc>d</sc>-[3-3H]-glucose (PerkinElmer, catalog NET331C001MC, 20 Ci/mMol &#8212; reconstituted in saline to obtain final concentration of 0.1 &#956;Ci/&#956;L) was employed as a glucose turnover tracer. For the basal period (time &#8211;80 to time 0), following a bolus infusion of 1 &#956;Ci in 1 minute, a steady 0.1 &#956;Ci/min infusion rate was used. Blood samples (~20&#8211;25 &#956;L) from tail cut were collected using heparinized glass capillary tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 22-362566) at times &#8211;80, &#8211;20, &#8211;10, and 0, then centrifuged at 10,000<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 minutes at 4&#176;C, and plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and stored frozen at &#8211;80&#176;C until use. For the pre-clamp and clamp periods (i.e., from time 0 until the end of experiment) <sc>d</sc>-glucose was infused at the rate 0.2 &#956;Ci/min (2 &#956;L/min). Also, at time 0, insulin (Humulin, Eli Lilly &amp; Co, catalog NDC 0002-8215-01) administration at the dose of 4 mU/min/kg body weight was initiated (using a separate infusion pump) with a 1-minute, 10 &#956;L bolus, followed by continuous infusion at 1 &#956;L/min throughout pre-clamp and clamp periods. Simultaneously, infusion of 50% dextrose in saline (Hospira, Inc, catalog NDC 0409-66-02) was started with variable infusion rates aimed at reaching and maintaining the blood glucose level at 150 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels were measured using a glucometer every 10 minutes, and the glucose infusion rates were adjusted accordingly. Once the desired blood glucose level was stable (typically after 70&#8211;110 minutes), a glucose uptake tracer (2-DG [14C], PerkinElmer, catalog NEC495001MC, 56 mCi/mMol reconstituted in saline) was administered as a single bolus at a dose of 13 &#956;Ci in 96 &#956;L of saline over 1 minute at time 75. Blood samples (~20&#8211;25 &#956;L) from tail cut were collected at times 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 minutes, then centrifuged at 10,000<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 minutes at 4&#176;C, and plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and stored frozen at &#8211;80&#176;C until use. After the clamp period, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and tissues of interest were harvested and frozen. Typically, it took 2&#8211;3 minutes to anesthetize a mouse and around 2&#8211;3 minutes to harvest tissues (time depends on number of tissues needed). Glucose concentrations in the plasma and in the 50% dextrose infusates were measured using an enzymatic method (Analox Instruments Ltd, catalog GMD9). Plasma samples (5 &#956;L) were diluted with 10 &#956;L of saline, treated with 70 &#956;L of 0.1N Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> and 70 &#956;L of 0.1N ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (both from MilliporeSigma), then centrifuged at 16,000<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5 minutes at 4&#176;C.
