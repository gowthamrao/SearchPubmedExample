In 2017, the global age-standardized prevalence of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis was 1,395 (1,323&#8211;1,470) and 132 [128&#8211;136] per 100,000 population, respectively. In the same year, cirrhosis was responsible for more than 1.32 million (95% uncertainty interval, 1.27&#8211;1.45) deaths, which represented 2.4% (95% uncertainty interval 2.3&#8211;2.6) of all deaths worldwide (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The most common etiologies of cirrhosis are chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholism, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The different etiologies of cirrhosis present with similar progression patterns (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In China, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the primary cause of cirrhosis (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The 5-year cumulative incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma increase gradually at different stages of HBV infection (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, when a patient progresses to cirrhosis, in addition to treatment to address the cause, steps need to be taken to prevent and reduce complications. Therefore, early detection of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is of great significance to the formulation of treatment plans and improving prognosis (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Several assessment methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, among which liver biopsy is the gold standard for clinical evaluation (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, liver biopsy has some limitations, including its invasiveness, the risk of postoperative complications, inconsistencies between and within observers, and the accuracy of the results being easily affected by sampling errors (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Some imaging techniques, such as elastography and magnetic resonance elastography, have the advantages of being non-invasive and reproducible for the evaluation of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To date, there have been many studies on the clinical value of fibroscans and ultrasound (US) elastography in the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis, and vibration-controlled transient elastography is possibly the most widely used technique at present (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, the diagnostic ability of computed tomography (CT) was not intended to exceed these methods.</p><p>For patients with chronic liver disease who undergo enhanced CT scanning for whatever reason, CT measurement methods can provide radiologists with more comprehensive and additional valuable information. Based on morphological changes of cirrhosis, Awaya <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> used the caudate-right lobe ratio&#8212;a ratio-based method assessing the right portal vein to set the lateral boundary&#8212;to diagnose cirrhosis and reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.797 (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the cases in their study mainly were alcoholic cirrhosis, whereas HBV infection is the dominant cause of cirrhosis in China (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Other studies have shown that the proportion of patients with caudate lobe enlargement was significantly higher among those with alcoholic cirrhosis than those with viral cirrhosis (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Also, the degree of hypertrophy may vary due to differences in the blood supply of the caudate lobe among all populations (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, the caudate-right lobe ratio method has poor diagnostic efficacy for cirrhosis. Further, in patients with hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis, characteristic changes include shrinkage in the anterior part of the right lobe and enlargement of the posterior segment of the right lobe. We speculated whether these morphological changes are also applicable to patients with other etiologies.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we proposed a new distance ratio measurement method for CT images: the L-distance ratio. We compared the performance of the L-distance ratio with that of the caudate-right lobe ratio in diagnosing cirrhosis. We present the following article in accordance with the STARD reporting checklist (available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://qims.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/qims-22-861/rc" ext-link-type="uri">https://qims.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/qims-22-861/rc</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013).

In the cirrhosis group, patients were pathologically diagnosed cirrhosis, but morphological changes, such as widening of liver fissures, wavy edges, enlargement of the caudate lobe and left lobe of the liver, and atrophy of the right lobe on imaging, were not sufficient to diagnose cirrhosis. Those who were pathologically confirmed to be free of cirrhosis and fibrosis and without a history of chronic hepatic were classified as the control group. For all included patients, the interval between the time of the liver biopsy and the abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan was less than 3 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (I) the right branch of the portal vein could not be measured (for example, because of variation in the origin of the right portal vein); (II) the diameter of benign lesions in the liver was greater than 20 mm; (III) the image was blurred; (IV) the patient was under the age of 18 years; and (V) the patient had undergone abdominal surgery (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><italic toggle="yes">Figure 1</italic></xref>).

Liver biopsy specimens were fixed with formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin, and the sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and elastic van Gieson. Each biopsy specimen was analyzed by a pathologist with more than 3 years&#8217; experience. The pathologists used the Knodell histology activity index scoring system, which considers periportal plus or minus bridging necrosis, intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). On microscopy, the liver samples exhibited fibroblasts in the portal area showing evident hyperplasia, widening of the fibrous septum, grid division in liver cells, the formation of a pseudo-lobule of the liver, and typical liver fibrosis; all of these findings are indicative of hepatic cirrhosis. Biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging techniques</title><p>A General Electric Company (GE) Lightspeed VCT 64-slice spiral CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform a non-contrast scan and an enhanced scan of the axial upper abdomen or the whole abdomen. The scanning parameters were as follows: 120 kVp; automatic tube current modulation; section thickness, 5 mm; and reconstruction section thickness, 1.0 mm. Following unenhanced CT, dynamic contrast enhancement was performed for 30 seconds (arterial phase), 60 seconds (portal phase), and 180 seconds (delayed phase) after the completion of an intravenous injection of nonionic contrast material (iopamidol 370 mg I/mL, 1.5 mL/kg) at a rate of 3.5&#8211;4.5 mL/s.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of the two evaluation methods</title><p>In this study, two distance ratio-based evaluation methods&#8212;our proposed L-distance ratio and the traditional caudate-right lobe ratio&#8212;were assessed and compared for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Both methods were performed during the portal phase of enhanced CT scans. The detailed procedures for the two methods are presented below:</p><p>For L-distance ratio evaluation, two lines were first drawn parallel to the right branch. Then, two vertical lines were drawn at the bifurcation of the right branch and from the bifurcation of the right branch to the posterior edge of the liver, defined as R and to the anterior edge of the liver, defined as L. The L-distance ratio, named after its L-shape, was expressed as the ratio of R to L (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig"><italic toggle="yes">Figure 2A,2B</italic></xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="f2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Definition of the two methods. (A) L-distance ratio evaluation: two lines were drawn parallel to the right branch. Two vertical lines were drawn at the bifurcation of the right branch from them to the posterior edge of the liver, defined as R, and to the anterior edge of the liver, defined as L. The L-distance ratio was expressed as the ratio of R to L. (B) The ratio calculated using L-distance ratio was 1.02 in this patient with cirrhosis. (C) Caudate-right lobe ratio evaluation: lines I, II, and III were parallel to the midsagittal plane.

The distance between lines II and III (representing the width of the caudate lobe) was defined as C, and the distance between lines II and I (representing the width of the right lobe) was defined as R. The caudate-right lobe ratio was expressed as the ratio of C to R (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig"><italic toggle="yes">Figure 2C,2D</italic></xref>). All abdominal CT images were reviewed by two expert radiologists, each with more than 3 years&#8217; experience. The L-distance ratio and the caudate-right lobe ratio were measured using the described methods. Images of each patient were reviewed by evaluators, who were blinded to all patient information, including the final diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Texture feature extraction</title><p>For each patient, a 30 mm<sup>2</sup> region of liver parenchyma was delineated in one slide using the ITK-SNAP software (version 4.7.2; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://itk.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://itk.org/</ext-link>), and the region could not include blood vessels. Feature extraction was performed with the radiomics toolbox (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Two types of quantitative image features were extracted: (I) histogram features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and moment 5&#8211;10); and (II) texture features [gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) energy, GLCM contrast, GLCM entropy, GLCM homogeneity, GLCM correlation, GLCM sumaverage, GLCM variance, GLCM dissimilarity, and GLCM autocorrelation]. The AUC value for distinguishing the cirrhosis and control groups was calculated for histogram and texture features. If the AUC value of a feature was greater than 0.70, the feature was considered potentially significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to analyze the interobserver agreement between the two observers. Binary logistic regression was used for univariate analysis. The strength of an association was given as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of two methods for diagnosing cirrhosis were calculated at different cut-off points. To compare the L-distance ratio and the caudate-right lobe ratio, the ROC curve was constructed and the AUC calculated. The diagnostic value was determined by the AUC. The AUC values of the two methods were compared using the DeLong test. We also analyzed the distribution of normal and cirrhosis cases according to the prediction of the two methods. Patients with missing data were excluded, and the imputation method was not used in the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) or R language (R version 4.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with a two-sided P value &lt;0.05 indicating statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>The cirrhosis group included 42 men and 20 women (age range, 28&#8211;77 years; mean age, 51 years).

Compared with the traditional caudate-right lobe ratio method, our proposed method is simple, accurate and robust, and has potential value in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.</p><p>Liver fibrosis causes compression and irregular stenoses of the intrahepatic branches of the portal vein (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and as a result, the blood supply transitions from the portal vein to the hepatic artery (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The blood supply to the right lobe has more influence usually because the right portal vein enters the right lobe directly (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These events lead to morphological changes, including enlargement of the caudate and left liver lobes, and atrophy of the right lobe (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Although these shape features have been used for the diagnosis of many tumors in clinical practice (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), using appearance alone to diagnose cirrhosis is subjective. Moreover, these features indicate that the disease has already progressed to a more severe stage. The treatment and prognosis of liver cirrhosis mainly depend on the stage of fibrosis (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and there is a progressive increase in the relative risk of liver mortality with the development of fibrosis (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, early screening of patients with cirrhosis is of great significance to guiding clinical treatment decisions.</p><p>To date, the diagnostic efficacy of two-dimensional diameter assessment in cirrhosis has not been satisfactory, and a recognized diagnostic standard has yet to be established. Cirrhosis typically manifests as hypertrophy in the left and caudate lobes and as atrophy of the right lobe (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Based on these morphological changes, Harbin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) chose the main portal vein as a boundary marker to separate the caudate lobe from the right lobe and to calculate the ratio of their distances. When the cutoff point was 0.55, the accuracy was 65.7%. However, hypertrophy of the caudate lobe may extend further to the right, beyond the main portal vein, which may correspond to the bifurcation point of the right portal vein. Therefore, the right portal vein may be more suitable than the main portal vein for dividing the caudate lobe from the liver. Based on this, Awaya <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) selected the bifurcation point of the right portal vein as the boundary marker and calculated the caudate-right lobe ratio. When the cutoff point was 0.9, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 71.7%, 77.4%, and 74.2%, respectively. The caudate lobe is composed of the left Spiegel lobe, the paracaval portion, and the caudate process, and their hemodynamics are generally variable (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which also makes the degree of caudate lobe hypertrophy variable. Also, we found that the right branch bifurcation point was not at the same level as the caudate lobe, which influenced the diagnostic performance of the caudate-right lobe ratio. Research has shown that shrinkage in the anterior part of the right lobe, especially the middle hepatic vein drainage area, and enlargement of the posterior segment of the right lobe, are characteristic of hepatitis C-related cirrhotic liver (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The right portal vein divides into anterior and posterior branches; the right anterior branch supplies segments V and VIII, while the right posterior branch supplies segments VI and VII (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used the ratio of the vertical distance from the bifurcation point of the right portal vein to the sides of the liver and selected the most appropriate cutoff point to explore whether this method is effective in diagnosing cirrhosis. Our results show that the diagnostic efficacy of the L-distance ratio is superior to that that of the caudate-right lobe ratio. A high L-distance ratio was identified as an indicator for diagnosing cirrhosis (OR =6.47, 95% CI: 2.96&#8211;14.2, P&lt;0.001). The AUC of our method reached 0.823, whereas that of the existing method was 0.663. However, the sensitivity of the caudate-right lobe ratio method at the optimal cutoff point in our study was lower than that reported by Awaya (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A possible reason for this difference is that the primary etiology in the sample reported by Awaya was alcoholic cirrhosis. In another study, the proportion of patients with caudate lobe enlargement was significantly higher among those with alcoholic cirrhosis than among those with viral cirrhosis (P&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the present study, cirrhosis was mostly caused by HBV, and alcoholic cirrhosis accounted for only three cases. Many studies have been conducted on the clinical impact of fibroscan and US elastography in the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis, and these techniques have been reported to have higher accuracy than ratios measured on CT images (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For example, the AUC of shear-wave elastography in the assessment of advanced fibrosis was 0.89, and cutoffs of 8.7 and 10.3 kPa provided sensitivity and specificity of 90% (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, a deliberate clinical approach informed by a knowledge of the pitfalls and preparation for multiple contingencies in case of indeterminate results is crucial. Our approach provides useful and complementary information for clinical practice.</p><p>Many studies have reported that texture features also achieved success in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We found that the AUC values of GLCM_contrast, GLCM_homogeneity, GLCM_correlation, and GLCM_dissimilarity were all greater than 0.70, but these features had a poorer performance than the L-distance ratio in our study. Although it may be better to combine the features, feature selection is usually not effective in studies with limited cases due to the issue of overfitting. Further studies using a larger cohort are needed to evaluate the performance of combing texture and morphology-based ratio features.</p><p>The measurements in this study did not require post-processing of the images and had high clinical operability. Additionally, the L-distance ratio method does not require the right branch to be at the same level as the caudate lobe, which compensates for the limitations of the caudate-right lobe ratio method. However, our study still had some limitations. First, as a single-center retrospective study, selection bias was inherent. Second, anatomical variation of the portal vein is present in approximately 20&#8211;35% of the population. The two common variations are trifurcation of the portal vein&#8212;where the portal vein divides into the right anterior, right posterior, and left branches&#8212;and early branching of the right posterior portal vein from the main portal vein. Another, less common, variation is early division of the right portal vein (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Patients with this variation were excluded from the study, and consequently, there may have been a selection bias. Third, fact that we used a small sample from a single hospital was another limitation. We will require a large number of samples to demonstrate the advantages of our method in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposed L-distance ratio can evaluate cirrhosis more accurately than the traditional caudate-right lobe ratio. This method is a non-invasive, convenient, and reproducible clinical measurement approach, and thus, provides value in guiding clinical treatment of cirrhosis. In patients with chronic liver disease, an L-distance ratio of more than 0.80 indicates that cirrhosis is likely, which could assist clinicians in formulating corresponding interventions to improve prognosis as much as possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><p>The article&#8217;s supplementary files as</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="anchor" id="su1" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="qims-13-03-1499-rc.pdf" id="d64e626" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/qims-22-861</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="qims-13-03-1499-coif.pdf" id="d64e629" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/qims-22-861</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="qims-13-03-1499-supplementary.pdf" id="d64e632" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/qims-22-861</object-id></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Funding</italic>: This work was supported by Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (No. 2021B0101420006), the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (No. 2021YFF1201003), the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. 81925023), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82071892), High-level Hospital Construction Project (Nos.
