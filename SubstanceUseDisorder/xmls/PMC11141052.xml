This definition of health was formulated in 1946 in the post-war era and has not been changed even though the definition of health and the notion of what is considered &#8220;healthy&#8221; has evolved over time (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The current definition of health is problematic as it implies that a healthy individual is one who always has complete physical, mental, and social functioning. Few people, if any, can fit this definition of health. This definition also minimizes the role of human capacity to cope and labels those with chronic, progressive, or relapsing&#8211;remitting conditions permanently unhealthy (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These criticisms are specifically relevant in populations with health conditions that are often chronic or relapsing&#8211;remitting like mental health and substance use (MHSU) disorders.</p><p>Emerging definitions of health have suggested a shift in focus to one&#8217;s ability to adapt and self-manage (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), social determinants of health as well as policy and environment (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and functionality and wellbeing (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A new definition of health as &#8220;the ability to adapt and to self-manage&#8221; has been proposed (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This definition includes the one&#8217;s ability of people to adapt to their life situation and acknowledges that health differs from person to person. This definition, however, makes it difficult to measure health on a population level.</p><p>Expanding definitions of health is crucial in understanding the impact of MHSU disorders on health and in designing health services for people with MHSU disorders. Mental health is vitally important to overall health (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This is especially important in adolescence and young adulthood where MHSU disorders are disproportionately more prevalent in youths aged 15&#8211;24 (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;10</xref>). The onset of many other mental health conditions occurs during this period of development (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (p. 8) and often the use of substance use further exacerbates the mental health condition (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) (p. 423). In addition, studies have shown that youths with substance use disorders have increased risk of developing psychiatric symptoms and disorders (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). MHSU disorders in adolescence also increases the risk of comorbid physical health problems in later life (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;18</xref>) as well as adverse social outcomes in adulthood such as lower educational attainment, poverty, and social isolation (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is therefore critical for the healthcare system to engage youth early and intervene early (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</p><p>Youth with MHSU disorders experience multiple health and social challenges and therefore require comprehensive interventions. Integrated youth services (IYS) models are being proposed to support the full range of health and social needs for youth (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21&#8211;23</xref>). The IYS model aims to improve the quality of mental health and substance use services for youth by providing multiple services in youth-specific settings (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In IYS models, youth are crucial stakeholders in designing how health services are delivered and evaluated. However, there is still a significant gap in understanding these health needs and priorities, as defined by youths themselves (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A critical step toward this is establishing a unified understanding of how &#8220;health&#8221; is defined and conceptualized from the perspective of young people. Formal definitions and current frameworks of health might not be sufficient to explain the perspectives of youth with MHSU conditions.</p><p>To build a youth-centered healthcare system for youths with MHSU disorders, it is critical to understand and identify important health outcomes that matter to youth. Therefore, the central question of this study is &#8220;What is the concept of good health in youths who experienced MHSU disorders?&#8221; The objectives of this study were to understand and identify component of good health through the perspectives of youths who have experienced MHSU disorders and identify important factors that affect their ability to achieve good health. Results of this qualitative study will allow us to understand important prognostic factors and identify important outcomes that should be measured in a IYS system.</p><sec id="sec6"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited using purposeful sampling. Flyers were handed out by staff and posted in the common areas of an IYS center providing health and wellness resources, services and supports to youth with MHSU disorders in (blinded for review). Clients at this center can self-refer or be referred to services by a health practitioner. Services at this community-based center were delivered by a team of interdisciplinary healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, counselors, and peer support specialists). Eligibility criteria included youths who have received or are receiving MHSU services, aged 17&#8211;24&#8201;years, willingness, and ability to read and respond in English, and able to provide informed consent or have a guardian to provide consent. This age group was chosen because they were in a developmental transition phase (i.e., from high school to college; college to work). As access to specialized mental healthcare is scarce for this vulnerable population our research time decided that a formal diagnosis of MHSU disorders was not required for study participation. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the interviews. Participants below 19&#8201;years of age provided informed assent to participate in the focus groups and had a guardian who gave consent. A small honorarium was paid to all participants. This study was approved by the (blinded for review).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p>Three focus groups were conducted between July to August 2017 at the same center where participants were recruited and accessed their mental health services and, hence, was perceived as a safe and inclusive environment. Focus group technique was chosen because the aim of this study was to build a better understanding of the construct of health. There is existing knowledge of the construct of health, but the current framework is inadequate when used in mental health conditions. The use of focus groups allowed us to generate more themes (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We stopped data collection when data saturation was reached; that is, if similar codes and meaning of codes were repeated in subsequent interviews (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Each focus group lasted approximately 90&#8201;min. All participants in the focus groups were grouped by age to encourage interaction (two groups ages 20&#8211;24&#8201;years, one group ages 17&#8211;18&#8201;years). Three main questions were asked in the focus groups:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What does health mean to you?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What does it look like to be in a good/poor health state?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is needed for someone to move from a poor to a good health state?</p></list-item></list><p>All focus groups had two facilitators. The primary facilitator was a research assistant with qualitative research methodology experience. This facilitator had limited, if any, exposure to participants prior to the focus groups. The other facilitator was the study&#8217;s peer research partner who was also a peer support worker (PSW) at the center. A PSW in our context is an individual with lived experience of mental health and/or substance use issues providing support based on this shared experience. The PSW did have prior relationships with some participants of the focus group and was an established presence in the center. During the focus groups, this facilitator mainly wrote field notes and provided some prompts. Also in the room was the last author who observed and took field notes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim by the second author and a research assistant.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted on NVivo 10. Transcripts were de-identified before being uploaded onto NVivo. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis utilizing an inductive approach. This approach allows researchers to systematically understand the experiences of groups who have navigated or are still navigating the ups and downs of the recovery process and explore what achieving &#8220;good health&#8221; mean for them (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The first two authors performed the analysis. Transcripts were read through once before coding. Thematic analysis utilizing a data-driven, inductive approach was used to analyze the data (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). At the second reading, notes were written and data were organized into broad thematic codes. Multiple readings of the transcripts allowed the researchers to focus on the subjective experiences of the participants and practice reflexivity. A preliminary list of codes was formed from the first transcript. Coding was performed after each interview. This process was repeated for the next two transcripts. New codes that emerged from each transcript were added to the list. A saturation grid was created to reflect the common codes in each focus group. After going through the third transcript, no new codes were added. All codes from each focus group were then analyzed at the micro level to inductively identify overarching themes. Agreement of final themes was achieved through an iterative process of discussion among research team members and constant review of the data.</p><p>Member checking was conducted twice with three of the participants throughout the analysis process. Participants reviewed all themes and agreed that they were understandable and representative. The first time was after broad and micro themes were proposed. Participants reviewed and ensured that all themes were understandable and representative. The second point of contact was to confirm the proposed definition of health and quotes selected were appropriate, understandable, and representative. Data source triangulation was also conducted with the notes from the facilitators and the author present at the interviews (SB).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec10"><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p>Altogether, 22 participants participated in three focus groups (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

This also included access to &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">medications</italic>&#8221; and &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">harm-reduction</italic>&#8221; including &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">narcan</italic>,&#8221; treatment centers, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">youth detox</italic>,&#8221; addiction specific counseling and opioid replacement therapy (&#8220;<italic toggle="yes">ORT</italic>&#8221;). Being able to access these services was essential for good health. However, many participants felt that long waitlists and limited opening hours made it difficult for them to access the help that they needed. Some participants had concerns regarding age limits and found these limits to be arbitrary. They also expressed frustration that accessing services was often disjointed and required going to many places and/or through many people to access services that seemed related. These were factors that they could not control but could lead to a poorer health outcome for them.</p><p>Socioeconomic status was another important contributor to health. Many participants on social assistance felt that social assistance payments were too low and that having &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">higher pay</italic>&#8221; or even a &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">higher minimum wage</italic>&#8221; would help one achieve a better health state. They also associated being on welfare as not being in good health, because &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">somebody on the high end of the scale preferably probably not be on welfare because usually it&#8217;s when you are at the&#8230; I think you are gonna have excess</italic>.&#8221; As another participant put it, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">welfare&#8217;s not enough to survive on</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you are not gonna be thriving in health or food or housing or anything like that surviving on welfare</italic>.&#8221;</p></sec><sec id="sec19"><title>Social factors</title><p>This subtheme describes how interpersonal relationships relate to health and includes references to a support system within and outside of a formal health care team. People in a good health state were described as having &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">good relationships</italic>&#8221; and &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">being able to communicate well with others</italic>.&#8221; Good support systems were made of &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">people that are there for you like all the time</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">like somebody you can always reach and get a hold of</italic>&#8221; and included &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">family and friends</italic>&#8221; and &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">other people who have gone through the same thing</italic>,&#8221; with specific reference to &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">peer support workers</italic>&#8221; and &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">NA</italic> [narcotics anonymous], <italic toggle="yes">AA</italic> [alcoholics anonymous] <italic toggle="yes">sponsors</italic>.&#8221; Having a good support network was also important for good health, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">cause those people will never let you be in a bad state</italic>,&#8221; but &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">unhealthy friendships</italic>&#8221; and isolation were a negative impact on health. This was summarized by one participant who shared: &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">isolation</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you know feeling like you do not have a family or a community or friends</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">whatever that looks like to you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but the absence of it is very unhealthy</italic>.&#8221; Being alone and isolated was also associated with poor outcomes as reiterated by another participant, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">cause lonely people</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">kinda die</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Die off</italic>.&#8221;</p><p>Help to access services such as employment, housing and education was also highlighted. Searching for resources was often confusing and difficult; having access to people who could help them navigate pursuing education in the context of mental health disorders would be helpful. Other factors having a positive impact on health that were mentioned by some of our participants were &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">security</italic>&#8221; and &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">stability</italic>.&#8221; This is illustrated by a participant who shared, &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">if you are on the path to recovery and you have to worry about a lot of things</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">like your next meal or you know</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">how you are gonna get through the night</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that can push you in the opposite direction</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">So</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">security</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">knowing that you know</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">the things in your life are gonna be consistent&#8230; so you can focus on yourself</italic>.&#8221;</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we wanted to understand the concept of good health in the eyes of youth who experienced MHSU disorders and identify the factors that may prevent them from achieving good health. Our results provided their narrative of what health is to them. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, to our participants, health is embedded in the context of one&#8217;s environment, a consequence of the systemic and social influences. Health consisted of physical health, mental health, day to day functioning, and being in control of your own health condition. Systemic and social factors were factors that influenced the state of health. Recognition of these causal and mitigating factors and distinguishing them from the construct of health is important as the measurement of health and design of mental health services will not be accurate if these factors were not addressed.</p><p>Good health, in the eyes of our participants, was a continuum, which consisted of physical, mental, and social components along with a functional element when defining health. The concept that health is a continuum is not new, but our results highlighted the struggles with &#8220;sobriety&#8221; that participants faced and showed that the concept of health expands beyond the definition of health by WHO (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30&#8211;32</xref>). Staying sober was difficult and something that had to be achieved to be considered &#8220;healthy.&#8221; Resilience and playing an active role in the management of their health condition were also recurring themes. When thinking about the evaluation of IYS programs, measures reflecting these outcomes should be included. Items reflecting daily functioning, self-image, and emotional health are common in many health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures like the Euroqol-5D (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the struggles with &#8220;sobriety&#8221; are not often reflected in many generic health measures (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Looking physically healthy, like being free of scars and being a healthy weight, were important physical indicators associated with recovery from substance use. For evaluation of health outcomes in youths with MHSU disorders, items or outcomes reflecting recovery and coping with addiction should also be included.</p><p>The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is characterized by major social role changes and growing societal expectations. Having a MHSU disorder during this period could hamper life opportunities and shape quality of life in later life (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). For our participants with MHSU disorders, systematic and social factors were impacted their perception of health. The impact may vary from participant to participant but in general, the presence of these factors have been shown to mitigate the risk of early substance use and mental health issues in youths (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35&#8211;37</xref>). This is aligned with previous studies with children and youths, emphasizing the importance of these factors (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Prevention, early intervention and increasing access to appropriate treatment resources are the best treatment strategies in youth MHSU care and a continuum of care, ranging from early intervention to crisis response, is needed for youths (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Presently, while medications for substance use have been known to reduce substance use, access to these medications is limited for youths (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, continued engagement and support of youths with MHSU disorders and ensuring access to health services are crucial in attaining a good health state. In addition, from a measurement perspective, it is important to tease out these factors to be able to understand and accurately measure outcomes that matter. This supports recent calls to redefine health, beyond the absence of disease and infirmity, and include meaningful domains that can inform health services and policy (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>The notion that health is more than just individual behavior and health habits is also supported by other frameworks of health and determinants of health such as the Wider Determinants of Health Model and the Mandala of Health model (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Both models depict how interactions with the environment affect health. The definition of health and the design of health services for youths must acknowledge and address the systemic and social factors that will influence their ability to achieve good health. In addition, often the conceptualization and measurement of health is focused on ill-health, however, when we recognize that health is a continuum, the focus can be shifted to the more favorable end of the continuum and health services can be focused on moving people toward &#8220;good health&#8221; (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). This shift in perspective is needed and we recommend actively involving the intended audience in designing timely interventions for this population (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, our findings indicated that the path of recovery involved learning to manage their MHSU disorders. Recovery was a challenging path characterized by periods of ups and downs (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Both mental health professionals and patients should be aware and prepared for setbacks on the path of recovery. Learning to manage their health condition, which will include both physical and mental health symptoms, is therefore an important element and should be included in the standard treatment for youths with MHSU disorders.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the involvement of participants throughout the iterative coding process. This engagement provided the opportunity for triangulation and ensured that results were representative of participants&#8217; experience. The participation of a peer research partner in each phase of this project is another major strength of our study (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This ensured that questions were appropriate, and results was understandable to the target population. Our peer research partner was also a PSW at the center, with the intention that having a trusted, established peer involved in facilitation would increase the comfort of participants.</p><p>There were also limitations that warrant discussion. Our sample consisted of a specific age group, 17&#8211;24&#8201;years old, with the majority being over age 19, and most participants had access and were receiving mental health services. This may limit the applicability of our findings to other populations. Future research is needed to explore definitions of health among diverse samples of youth experiencing varied health vulnerabilities and protective factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study contributes evidence that health in the context of MHSU disorders, is a multidimensional construct impacted by basic safety and security needs. MHSU services for youth should take a more holistic approach in treatment and address these basic needs and other social determinants of health as part of the treatment plan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec22"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because the data are not publicly available due to restrictions, i.e., their containing information that could compromise the privacy of research participants.
