Although the prevalence is estimated at 0.28% [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], schizophrenia is a debilitating type of serious mental illness that disrupts daily functioning [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It contributes to approximately 1.7% of the total years of a life lived with disability (YLDs) to the burden of disease globally [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite such challenges associated with schizophrenia, most individuals with schizophrenia can achieve long-term remission and functional recovery, provided appropriate care is secured [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, many individuals living with schizophrenia experience relapses, with a considerable proportion of them being rehospitalized in specialized psychiatric hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Schizophrenia is characterized by recurrent relapses, which contribute to the further downward drift in functioning, as the previous episodes increase the risk of further relapses [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A relapse is defined as the exacerbation or reemergence of positive symptoms accompanied by noticeable functional and behavioral changes after previous stabilization/remission [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Each relapse significantly burdens their caregivers and society and results in hospitalization, which leads to the chronic stage of the disease, cognitive impairment due to progressive structural brain damage, personal distress, incarceration, and interference with rehabilitation efforts [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Relapse rates, often operationalized as psychiatric rehospitalization, vary from 50% to 92% in both developed and developing countries, despite the former having well-established mental health services [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The main risk factor for relapse is poor adherence to anti-psychotic medication, with others being substance use, comorbid psychiatric illness, medical and surgical conditions, stressful life events, and the treatment setting [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In managing schizophrenia and other forms of serious mental illness, psycho-social approaches, in combination with anti-psychotic drug therapy, may significantly reduce relapses compared to anti-psychotic treatment only [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While the risk of relapse may be reduced with appropriate mental health services and optimum treatment, the extreme scarcity of mental health services (MHS) outside specialized psychiatric hospital settings are extensive across sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, MHS-related support is inadequate outside specialist public sector psychiatry hospital settings for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, often considered the heart of the HIV endemic in South Africa, the rate of rehospitalization for schizophrenia is approximately 50%, with poor drug adherence being the main factor, this being patient-dependent [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Engagement in care following discharge and linkages to community care is crucial. Only a few studies have explored the determinants of relapse in KZN, with little known about the strategies for its prevention from the perspective of individuals living with serious mental illness and their caregivers. In the absence of knowing the risk factors for relapse and strategies for its prevention from patients&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; perspectives, it will not be possible to address the recurrent relapse that is pervasive in individuals living with SMI in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting and design</title><p>This study was conducted at a public specialized psychiatry hospital in Durban, South Africa. The qualitative approach used descriptive phenomenology with audio-recorded face-to-face interviews of inpatient study participants diagnosed with serious mental illness and their caregivers to explore their perspectives on the risk factors for relapse and strategies for its prevention. Specifically, we used the phenomenological approach compared to other qualitative methods to capture the shared meaning of the lived experience for patients and caregivers in the phenomenon of relapse [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants: Sampling and recruitment</title><p>The study participants were hospital inpatients with a history of psychiatric admissions who were in the recovery/treatment stage for two weeks and were selected using a consecutive sampling method. The additional inclusion criteria were 18 years or over, the ability to speak IsiZulu or English, and diagnosis with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychosis NOS, also known as other specified schizophrenic spectrum, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5<sup>th</sup> edition. Patients unable to give informed consent (having more than 2 positive and negative symptoms) were not eligible. An independent clinical team at the psychiatry hospital (e.g., doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, pharmacists, and occupational therapists) assessed the capacity (not actively psychotic with 2 or fewer positive and negative symptoms) of the potential study participants to consent before they were referred to our study. As the study explores the risk factors for relapse and strategies for its prevention from caregivers&#8217; perspectives, they were provided separate consent before their family members were approached to participate. The inclusion criteria for the above participant&#8217;s&#8217; caregivers were 18 years and over, able to speak isiZulu or English, and living with a patient for more than six months, with written and separate consent for all study participants being obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data collection</title><p>A trained interviewer, fluent in English and isiZulu, informed the 24 patients and six caregivers about the data collection procedure and conducted face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. The core questions explored their experience of in-hospital mental health services, reasons for admission, medication types and adherence, reasons for missing medication, discharge plans, needs after discharge, reasons for relapse, and strategies for continuing care. The study participants received an honorarium of R50, with the caregiver receiving R150 to cover travel and meal costs. The interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes, with the data being collected from 10<sup>th</sup> April 2019 to 24 July<sup>th</sup> 2019.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The demographic information was analyzed descriptively for both participants, while the qualitative responses were thematically analyzed. Each audio-recorded interview was transcribed verbatim before the following interview, with descriptive elemental coding occurring by repeated readings of the transcripts to develop initial codes [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The data analysis entailed using NVIVO 12 software and followed the inductive thematic analysis, the coding being data-driven [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To increase the trustworthiness of the data, three authors independently coded the text using NVIVO 12 software, after which they discussed any discrepancies and resolved through consensus, which resulted in the initial codebook being created. The clustered codes expressed the same or similar ideas to generate the sub-themes, with the relationship between the sub-themes being examined and matched with the two pre-specified themes.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Trustworthiness</title><p>To ensure rigor in this study, four criteria of trustworthiness were observed (credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability). Credibility was ensured by obtaining a thick description of the phenomena: triangulating data from different sources (patients and caregivers), conducting member checking during data collection, asking the questions repetitively, and undertaking daily transcriptions to inform the following interviews. Dependability was ensured by using a specific interview guide for the patients and caregivers, conducting inter-coder analyses, and debriefing the initial results to the study team. Confirmability was ensured by keeping interview notes, audio recording the interviews, and doing verbatim transcriptions that enabled quotes to be presented. Lastly, a thickness description of the results was discussed with other studies in the same context to ensure transferability.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Reflexivity</title><p>The interviewer reflected on the data collection process, kept daily notes, and did not interrupt the participants but sought clarity when necessary.

Although there are some overlap across the sub-themes, we discuss the major findings from the reported personal-related, family-related, and health system-related factor sub-themes that are associated with relapse risks, with an emphasis on strategies in this section.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Sub-theme 1: Personal-related risks and strategies factors</title><p>In this study, the patients and caregivers mentioned poor anti-psychotic drug adherence as a risk factor for relapse, consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Lack of transport money to attend the follow-up visits for drug refills was the reason for poor drug adherence, as participants from this study reported living a long distance from where they should collect their drugs. Furthermore, anti-psychotic medications are associated with side effects that make a few patients stop taking them, while some defaulted due to their experiences of gaining weight and having diarrhea, similar to Geddes [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A few patients reported forgetting the time for taking medication and that they did not have the food needed to enable their pill-taking, as noted by a number of authors [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To improve medication adherence, healthcare providers should provide comprehensive information about the potential side effects of anti-psychotic medication, including when to seek medical attention if they experience them. Additionally, automated phone calls and text messages can be implemented as a reminder system to ensure patients take their medication as prescribed.</p><p>However, the study patients are motivated to continue using the anti-psychotic medication as they perceived its benefit as enabling them to sleep well, with positive attitudes toward the benefits of anti-psychotic medication having been reported to increase adherence [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While some patients experienced side effects from the medication, the perceived benefits outweighed the perceived threat of psychosis symptoms, as supported by the Health Belief Model theory [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This highlights the need for incorporating teaching about the value of the anti-psychotic drug into the treatment plan to address modifiable behaviors for ensuring ongoing self-motivation and improved adherence.</p><p>Other patients understood the need to taking responsibility for their mental health and wanted to continue engaging in religious activities to help adhere to their treatment and prevent a relapse. While some religious teachings encourage a &#8217;miracle cure&#8217; and discourage the use of anti-psychotic medication [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], others provide the support that enables them to cope with schizophrenia. Being religious often increases the patient&#8217;s ability to cope and adhere to treatment and improves the quality of life due to strong social and spiritual support [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Health professional workers should create awareness of the importance of anti-psychotic medication among religious leaders and thereby create an additional support system for patients, as religion and spirituality can be important for people suffering from schizophrenia.</p><p>Some study participants also acknowledged using cannabis and alcohol, which resulted in them defaulting from taking medication as they forgot the time, needed to take it, and did not see the importance of taking it. Various studies consistently show the risk of substance use and psychosis [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is common for schizophrenia and can lead to relapse, independent of the other factors [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some study patients acknowledged stopping smoking weed and involving themselves in productive activities, which helped to reduce the likelihood of substance use, e.g., looking for a job. In addition, caregivers noted the need for daytime activities for patients. Keeping busy with familiar tasks gives a sense of purpose and achievement that can give meaning to life and prevent substance use. An inability to perform daily tasks is likely to cause further distress to patients with severe mental health problems [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], with a stable daily routine linked to feelings of well-being among patients with schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The social learning theory postulates that behavior can be learned through observation, imitation, and reinforcement [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Daily activities provide opportunities for individuals to observe and learn healthy behaviors and an alternative source of reinforcement, which can decrease the likelihood of turning to substance use. The occupational therapist should consider building vocational skills for patients, as improved functionality</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Sub-theme 2: Family related-risk and strategy factors</title><p>In this study, a few participants reported relapsing due to criticism from their family members, while some missed their follow-up visits as no-one could accompany them, and sometimes lacked travel money as their families could not support them. Other patients claimed the problems they face in their families increase the risk of relapse, such as the lack of family love and support [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The patients and caregivers suggested the involvement of family members as a strategy for relapse prevention by accompanying them for follow-up visits and monitoring medication intake, with the advantages of family motivation and support on the outcome of schizophrenia having been widely recognized [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The family&#8217;s involvement increases adherence to treatment and reduces relapse, with a supportive family expressing acceptance, warmth, understanding, and encouragement, which are predictors of recovery [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Health professional workers should involve family psychoeducation as part of the treatment, which will help improve family engagement.</p><p>Other patients wanted to build strong partner relationships as they felt they would remind them of the time and motivate them to take their medication, thereby increasing adherence and reducing the risk of relapse. Studies show that support from partners, including assisting with medication reminders and accompanying them for follow-up visits, reduces the risks of relapse [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The evidence from an HIV study shows that patients living with a partner are more likely to adhere to treatment [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. People with serious mental illness are said to lack interest in connecting to others, highlighting the need for health professional workers to involve family psychoeducation in treatment to build/establish social relationships and promote social skills training.</p><p>Moreover, patients and caregivers have recognized that their trust in traditional healers impacts their adherence to anti-psychotic medication, leading to increased costs compared to hospital treatment. Instead, caregivers have decided to prioritize hospital treatment over seeking assistance from traditional healers. In low-income countries, traditional healers are highly regarded and recognized for treating schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Healthcare providers should educate family members on the significance of medication adherence and the advantages of modern treatment compared to traditional approaches.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Sub-theme 3: Health system-related risks and strategies factors</title><p>In this study, the patients and caregivers highlighted that the lack of group therapy/support group, discharge plans, and preparation prevented them from being ready to cope with the adverse after being discharged due to a lack of problem-solving skills. The caregivers, in particular, felt ill-equipped to take on the responsibilities associated with caring for affected persons. Access to people who could guide them due to their own experiences would be invaluable. The patients suggested the involvement of a social worker for group counseling and family therapy to reduce the risk of relapse and provide a support system for those caring for affected persons. Social workers are an integral part of psychotherapy treatment, and incorporating them into practice will be useful in successfully transitioning patients from inpatient hospital care to outpatient support. The lack of social workers and clinical psychologists in SA is a pressing matter, particularly in underprivileged areas with limited mental health services. To overcome this challenge, task shifting is a potential solution. This strategy involves training non-specialists, such as community health workers or nurses, to deliver mental health care, including psychoeducation, within the community. By doing so, more individuals needing mental health services can receive care, even if a shortage of specialized professionals is available.</p><p>Psycho-social education is critical for enhancing the patient&#8217;s overall function, quality of life, motivation, and adherence to prescribed treatment [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the evidence shows that patients with schizophrenia are usually discharged from hospitals to follow-up at their nearest community mental health clinics, focusing mainly on pharmacotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and not educating patients and caregivers on managing a complex health condition. Ensuring enough healthcare workers trained to provide psychoeducation can be challenging in healthcare settings. Additionally, it&#8217;s important to consider patients&#8217; factors, such as cognitive ability and literacy level, as these can significantly impact the effectiveness of psychoeducation. However, using simplified language and providing psychoeducation to patients and caregivers may be more effective in addressing these challenges.</p><p>Engagement in care after hospital discharge is essential for patients with schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with preparation for their return to their communities being critical. The evidence indicates that the transition to the community and continuing with follow-up care is affected by the lack of unmet needs and failure to cope with their daily life, which increases the risk of relapse [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to lack of post discharge planning and provision of resources, the patients and caregivers also acknowledged that early discharge before remission and shortage of medications from the clinics increased the risks for relapse, consistent with the findings by [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This indicates the need for caregivers to be involved in discussions about discharge dates to avoid situations detrimental to the patient&#8217;s health, increasing the likelihood of relapse and readmission. Caregivers need to be informed about the conditions under which the patient would be released, what changes had occurred, how they could be expected to behave on discharge, and under what circumstances they need to be reevaluated for readmission.</p><p>In addition, the nearby availability of anti-psychotic drugs is one of the challenges reported in this study, as indicated by [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While medical services in SA are free at public sector facilities, the accessibility of anti-psychotic drugs is a barrier to optimum mental health services. Some second-generation antipsychotic drugs may only be available in specialized public sector psychiatry outpatient clinics or regional hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ensuring a regular and adequate supply of appropriate, safe, and affordable medication is one of the challenges in public sector mental health services [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The inconsistency in drug availability and accessibility and lack of consistency in the names of the medication provided (generics) need to be addressed to reduce confusion and relapse. Given the challenges associated with ongoing medication uptake, caregivers suggested using long-acting -injectables rather than taking a daily pill, as adherence to anti-psychotic drugs is the mainstay of preventing relapse in schizophrenia. Using atypical drugs with fewer side effects has advantages over &#8216;typical&#8217; drugs with more extra-pyramidal side effects. Studies show that most patients prefer long-acting injectable (LAI) formulae of anti-psychotics over oral medication, which obviates the need to remember to take medication daily [<xref rid="pone.0309238.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0309238.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]., In addition, the use of the public sector central chronic medicine dispensing and distribution (CCMDD) program, which allows patients to collect medication nearer to home, may be used to improve access to patients with schizophrenia by allowing the patients to pick up the medication at their convenience place. The effectiveness of the use of CCMDD in improving access has been observed in chronic diseases such as HIV. However, LAI is not available on CCMDD; hence the availability and accessibility of anti-psychotic drugs should be ensured at all levels of health care provision, thus obviating the need for people with limited resources to travel long distances every month to collect medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Study limitation</title><p>We acknowledged that the inclusion of inpatients soon after relapse could have impacted their reflective capacity. The caregiver sample size was small relative to the patient sample size, determined by those who agreed to participate. Future studies may need to engage family members and caregivers and survey a community sample of people with schizophrenia. Additionally, the findings describe the patients&#8217; perspectives on the barriers and facilitators around transition and do not fully capture the actual practice after discharge from the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Future directions</title><p>This study summarized the strategy for preventing relapse among patients with schizophrenia from the patients&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; perspectives, with both identifying the importance of self-motivation and personal responsibility for drug adherence. This needs to be supported by healthcare and social workers who ensure that patients develop positive attitudes toward medication during psychoeducation sessions and by incorporating family intervention therapy to increase their involvement in the treatment. Adequately preparing patients and their caregivers to be able to cope after discharge, providing access to support services as well as being able to access mental health care services closer to those who need them is also essential. A holistic approach to family, caregivers, and patient support is essential for reducing the mental health treatment gap that exists in South Africa and preventing relapses. In addition, a quantitative study with involvement of community members is warranted with further exploration of additional risk factors and preventive measures for relapse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants involved in this study and healthcare providers for assisting with the recruitment
