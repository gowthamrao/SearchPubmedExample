Programs such as the Spanish Thoracic Tumour Registry (TTR) and the global I-O Optimise initiative have been developed to observe patients in clinical practice with the aim of improving outcomes.

Adults aged &#8805;18 years with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC enrolled in the TTR between 01 Jan 2010 and 31 Oct 2019 were included in this analysis. Initial treatment received was described by cancer stage and histology (squamous and non-squamous NSCLC). Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated over a 5-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1,838 patients were included in the cohort, including 1,082 with stage IIIA (58.9%) and 756 with stage IIIB (41.1%).

Overall, 26.3% of patients received surgical resection (37.0% for stage IIIA and 11.1% for stage IIIB). The most frequent initial treatment received was concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage IIIA (30.2%) and stage IIIB (37.0%) patients.

In 2020, the number of new cases of lung cancer worldwide was 2,206,771 (11.4% of all new cancer cases) and the associated mortality was 1,796,144 (18.0% of cancer deaths) (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In Europe, lung cancer accounted for 384,176 (21.4%) cancer deaths in 2020; the death rate was similarly high in Spain (20.3%; 22,930), highlighting the need for lung cancer initiatives in this country (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for most lung cancer cases (84%); it has a poor prognosis, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 34&#8211;61% (non-metastatic) and 7% (metastatic) (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The 5-year survival in patients with NSCLC stage IIIA and IIIB is 26.2% and 17.3%, respectively (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). NSCLC is often diagnosed at a later stage due to lack of obvious symptoms (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which can make the management of this disease challenging.</p><p>For the management of locally advanced stage III NSCLC, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-guided treatment pathways recommend surgical resection wherever possible (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The exact treatment pathway will depend on a multidisciplinary team assessment including positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans and pathological staging. For patients with resectable stage III disease, surgery with curative intent, with or without (neo)adjuvant treatments is recommended. At the time of this study, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (usually with platinum-based chemotherapy with cisplatin) was the treatment of choice for patients with unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB disease, with a sequential approach as an alternative if needed (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors were being evaluated during this time as (neo)adjuvant treatment for patients with resectable disease or as consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in those with unresectable disease, and they are now recommended for use in this setting (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Durvalumab was also recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 as maintenance therapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC tumours with PD-L1 expression &#8805;1% (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and the ESMO guidelines were updated in 2021 to reflect this recommendation (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>It is essential to monitor how treatment modalities are being implemented in clinical practice in relation to outcomes. To address this, the I-O Optimise initiative was developed in 2017. I-O Optimise is a multinational collaborative research framework that is providing insights into the real-world management of thoracic malignancies, including NSCLC, with the aim of improving long-term clinical and safety outcomes (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To date, an I-O Optimise network has been established with thoracic data sources from Europe (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK) and Canada. The Spanish Lung Cancer Group (Grupo Espa&#241;ol de C&#225;ncer de Pulm&#243;n; GECP) has recently collaborated with the I-O Optimise network in association with the ongoing nationwide Thoracic Tumour Registry (TTR) study from Spain.</p><p>To gain a greater understanding of the management of stage III NSCLC, we performed further analysis of data from the TTR. The primary aim of this analysis was to observe treatment patterns and survival outcomes in patients with stage III NSCLC in Spain. These patients represent a heterogenous group of patients presenting with resectable and unresectable disease, and the treatment pathways are complex. A greater understanding of how these patients are being treated in real-world settings may help to tailor treatment pathways and improve outcomes.

As of Jul 2022, 25,018 patients with thoracic cancers from 88 centres have been included in the TTR. The TTR was initially created in 2016 by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (GECP), a multidisciplinary oncology group that was established in 1991 to promote lung cancer research.

Stage IIIC was introduced in the 8<sup>th</sup> TNM staging edition in 2017, as such no patient records with acceptable data quality were available at the time of this study. Only data from contributing centres with large populations (n&#8805;100) and robust linkage to mortality data were included from the TTR; patients diagnosed outside of the study period or with poor-quality data were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and data collection</title><p>Data on patient diagnosis were collected from 01 Jan 2010 to 31 Oct 2019 (latest data available at the time of the extraction) and follow-up data for treatments, disease progression, and death were collected until 31 Oct 2020; this timeframe was deemed sufficient to provide an overview of clinical care in Spain.</p><p>Extracted data were recorded in an electronic case report form (eCRF); these were maintained in accordance with updates from participating study sites. The following variables were recorded in the eCRF: sociodemographic and clinical characteristics including histology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, biomarker tests performed, NSCLC diagnosis (index date), initial treatments received, and death (date and cause) or last documented entry. All variables were entered in the eCRF by one reviewer and quality control was undertaken by a second independent reviewer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were performed; continuous data were summarised as mean, first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3), standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum, and categorical variables were described using percentages. No imputation methods were used to handle missing data except for date of birth; however, this was not required as all dates were complete.</p><p>Initial treatment was defined as the first date of radiotherapy administration, surgery, or first dose or prescription of systemic anticancer therapy (SACT) within 6 months of an NSCLC stage III diagnosis (index date). The proportion of patients receiving treatment and the frequency of treatment types were stratified by cancer stage (overall, IIIA, or IIIB NSCLC) and histology (squamous and non-squamous NSCLC). The initial treatments received were categorised into seven groups, which are regarded as the main therapeutic approaches in this setting: (I) neoadjuvant SACT then surgery, (II) surgery with adjuvant SACT, (III) surgery alone, (IV) sequential chemoradiotherapy, (V) concurrent chemoradiotherapy, (VI) SACT &#177; palliative radiotherapy, or (VII) radiotherapy alone. The rules applied to define these categories using TTR longitudinal data regarding treatment exposure are defined in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/public/TLCR-23-176-Supplementary.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link>. The list of SACT recorded as initial therapy is summarised in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/public/TLCR-23-176-Supplementary.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S2</ext-link>.</p><p>OS and progression-free survival (PFS) for treated patients stratified by cancer stage (overall, IIIA, or IIIB), histology, and initial treatment received were described using Kaplan-Meier methods. Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS, OS, and treatment duration were calculated over a 5-year period. OS was defined as the time from NSCLC diagnosis (index date) to death due to any cause. PFS was defined as the time from the treatment start until the earliest date based on progression (as recorded in the database), start of next line of therapy, death, lost to follow-up (censored), or study end (censored).</p><p>The clinical characteristics associated with surgical resection and use of neoadjuvant therapy were also described. Treatment response in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (i.e., any treatment group containing SACT) was also recorded and defined using complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, not evaluable, or not performed.</p><p>Univariate analyses were performed to identify sociodemographic and clinical covariates with a significant association with neoadjuvant treatment and surgical resection. These covariates, and any that were of clinical interest, were then entered into a multivariable selection model that used LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to reduce and select the final covariates. These covariates, together with sex and TN staging, were included in a multivariate regression model that examined their association with neoadjuvant therapy use (planned and actual) and surgical resection.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.1.2) and R Studio (version 2021.09.1+372) software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient cohort</title><p>Overall, 3,751 patients were diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and 1,838 patients met the inclusion criteria from which 1,082 (58.9%) were diagnosed at stage IIIA and 756 (41.1%) at stage IIIB NSCLC and were followed up for a median of 18.3 months (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/public/TLCR-23-176-Supplementary.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3</ext-link> and <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table"><italic toggle="yes">Table 1</italic></xref>).

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was found to be the most common initial treatment used for patients with stages IIIA and IIIB NSCLC in Spain during this period irrespective of stage or histology. (Neo)adjuvant therapy was more common in patients with stage IIIA NSCLC, and SACT &#177; palliative radiotherapy was more commonly used in patients with stage IIIB.</p><p>Survival outcomes were affected by several factors, including initial treatment choice. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was associated with survival of 29&#8211;39 months. The OS in patients receiving surgery with (neo)adjuvant SACT was high: up to 69 months. Similar findings were observed with PFS, although the effects were less pronounced. Furthermore, patients receiving palliative radiotherapy &#177; SACT had lower survival in our study; this is not the recommended treatment for stage III and its use may reflect those patients with poorer prognosis whereas patients receiving surgical resection would be those with a better prognosis, i.e., patients who were younger, had smaller tumours, and had less metastatic spread.</p><p>These findings are consistent with published data. One study showed that only 20&#8211;25% of patients with stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy will survive more than 5 years (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Survival has been shown to be higher in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving surgery with neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a 13% reduction in the risk of death, resulting in a 5-year survival improvement of 5% (from 40% to 45%) in a meta-analysis of 15 randomised controlled trials (2,385 resectable patients with stage IB to IIIA NSCLC) (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A more recent study in a real-world setting found that 5-year survival was 47.9% in resectable patients with stage III NSCLC (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Studies from Spain (NADIM and NADIM II) also showed that the addition of neoadjuvant nivolumab to platinum-based therapy in patients with resectable stage IIIA NSCLC resulted in improved PFS and OS; both studies also included nivolumab as adjuvant monotherapy, which may have impacted PFS and OS (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The OS at 24 months was 84.7% with nivolumab plus chemotherapy <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 63.4% with chemotherapy [hazard ratio =0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17&#8211;0.93; P=0.034] in NADIM II (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Based on these findings, the authors hoped that the perception of locally advanced lung cancer could change from one that is potentially lethal to one that is curable (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The surgery rates and median OS observed in our study were generally consistent with those observed in other real-world settings, such as the KINDLE study&#8212;a retrospective study of 3,151 patients with stage III NSCLC from 19 countries (in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East) in which the curative resection rate was 21.4%, median PFS was 12.5 months, and median OS was 34.9 months; concurrent chemoradiotherapy was also the most common treatment (29.4%) (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These investigators found significant associations with sex, stage, histology, and ECOG performance status, similar to the findings from the factor analysis models conducted in our study, which emphasises the importance of taking these associations into account when devising treatment plans; this is in line with guideline recommendations (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We also note the high rate of tobacco use, which is consistent with the smoking prevalence in Spain. This is a key area where lifestyle interventions are warranted.</p><p>With respect to PD-L1 expression, a predictor of response to some anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies, we found that nearly 30% of patients were tested, and a positive PD-L1 status (&#8805;1%) was observed in &gt;50% of these patients. This large proportion of positive results suggests that it is being used prognostically and that a significant number of patients could benefit from treatment directed at overexpression of PD-L1. The increasing use of PD-1/L1 testing in patients with NSCLC is a key area for further research in the TTR study cohort.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the findings reflect staging and treatment recommendations at the time this study was undertaken [2010&#8211;2019], and staging procedures had significantly changed during these years. During this time, concurrent chemoradiotherapy was treatment of choice in unresectable locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC and was usually based on platinum-doublet chemotherapy (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The initial SACT used in this study was primarily platinum-doublet chemotherapy for stage IIIA [832 (99.4%)] and stage IIIB [587 (97.4%)] NSCLC, which is consistent with the recommendations available during the study period. Surgical resection remains treatment of choice for resectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For patients with stage IIIA NSCLC, we found lower than expected use of surgery (37.0%). It is possible that the resectable patients in this study only received chemoradiotherapy as thoracic surgery teams/departments are not available at all sites in Spain. This may partly explain the range of treatments observed in this study, and we can see the impact that this had on PFS and OS, which varied widely.</p><p>The NADIM study, which evaluated induction therapy in stage III NSCLC has reported promising results, with the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to platinum-based chemotherapy resulting in an unprecedented major pathological response rate of 50&#8211;83% and pathological complete response of 21&#8211;59% (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, newer treatments such as immunotherapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were not widely used as initial therapy at the time of the analysis [2010&#8211;2019]. Durvalumab has been available in Spain since January 2020 for patients with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC who receive and complete concurrent chemoradiotherapy, but its use is restricted to PD-L1-positive tumours (usually &gt;1% PD-L1 expression). Durvalumab is already included in the Sociedad Espa&#241;ola de Oncolog&#237;a M&#233;dica (SEOM) and ESMO clinical guidelines based on the findings from the PACIFIC trial (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In this trial of 713 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, durvalumab demonstrated durable median PFS (16.8 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 5.6 months), median OS/time to distant metastasis (23.2 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 14.6 months) benefits, and estimated 5-year survival probability (95% CI) of 0.43 (0.38&#8211;0.47) <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 0.33 (0.28&#8211;0.38) after chemoradiotherapy versus placebo (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The 5-year OS rates seen in the PACIFIC trial are comparable with results presented here for patients receiving neoadjuvant SACT plus surgery, which range from 0.39 (95% CI: 0.15&#8211;1.00) in stage IIIB patients with non-squamous histology to 0.55 (95% CI: 0.39&#8211;0.77) in stage IIIA patients with squamous histology.</p><p>Since the release of the ESMO and SEOM guidelines, several new trials have reported data for treatment in stage III NSCLC. Osimertinib (EGFR targeted therapy) was associated with significantly longer disease-free survival in a study of 682 patients with <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-positive stage IB&#8211;IIIA NSCLC (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). At 3 years, 84% of patients (stage II&#8211;IIIA) were disease free compared with 34% who received placebo; OS data were immature at the time of publication (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The phase II KEYNOTE-799 trial has also been published and found that immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in 112 patients with stage III NSCLC had promising antitumour activity based on objective response rate (&gt;70%) (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved nivolumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy for adults with resectable NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting based on the findings of the CheckMate 816 trial in patients with resectable, histologically confirmed stage IB, II, or IIIA NSCLC (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Atezolizumab was also recently approved by the FDA for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with stage II&#8211;IIIA NSCLC whose tumours have PD-L1 expression &#8805;1% (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and by the EMA in patients with stage II&#8211;IIIA NSCLC whose tumours have PD-L1 expression &#8805;50% (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, some of these findings have not yet resulted in updates to official European guidelines for the treatment of stage III NSCLC.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our data were taken from a large registry in Spain that has undergone rigorous protocol assessment by an independent GECP committee. This registry represents a nationwide cohort and Spain has a National Health System with universal coverage ensuring that all patients undergo the same diagnostic work-up (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Another strength of this study was that data collected from the GECP would cover a sizeable population receiving secondary care in multiple hospital centres in Spain. There were minimal missing data for the variables assessed within this population. The study design was longitudinal, which allowed tracking of all patients over time. However, selection bias may have reduced the generalisability of the results, and a change in treatment guidelines over the period of this study may mean that the prognosis for patients differed depending on when the patients were treated. All contributing centres with &lt;100 patients were excluded from the study due to poor data quality on vital status and they did not frequently review data in the TTR. In addition, hospitals in the GECP network have a special focus on research and inclusion in the registry is voluntary; therefore, it is likely that the largest medical centres with access to a wider range of treatment options were over-represented and that care received in these hospitals may not be representative of care received across the entire Spanish population. This study was descriptive by design and statistical testing was hampered by confounding, small patient numbers among certain sub-cohorts, and limited 5-year follow-up for outcome evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This analysis of the TTR study describes the clinical reality surrounding the initial management and survival outcomes for stage III NSCLC in Spain over a 9-year period. It provides insights into the diverse approaches adopted for the treatment of stage III NSCLC prior to the availability of immunotherapies and targeted treatments in this setting. Survival outcomes are comparable with other real-world evidence, but improvement is still warranted. This is also a pivotal time in the management of NSCLC as (neo)adjuvant immunotherapies increasingly become the standard of care&#8212;and further research exploring the impact of these novel treatment strategies, including various immunotherapy regimens, may provide hope for improved patient outcomes. It may be necessary to monitor how these new clinical trial data are being incorporated into clinical practice and how they could improve the lung cancer patient&#8217;s outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><p>The article&#8217;s supplementary files as</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="anchor" id="su1" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tlcr-12-10-2113-rc.pdf" id="d64e1683" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tlcr-23-176</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tlcr-12-10-2113-dss.pdf" id="d64e1686" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tlcr-23-176</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tlcr-12-10-2113-prf.pdf" id="d64e1689" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tlcr-23-176</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tlcr-12-10-2113-coif.pdf" id="d64e1692" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tlcr-23-176</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tlcr-12-10-2113-supplementary.pdf" id="d64e1695" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tlcr-23-176</object-id></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Professional writing and editorial assistance were provided by Sam Phillips, PhD, DMS, from Parexel, funded by Bristol Myers Squibb.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Funding:</italic> This work was supported by <funding-source rid="sp1">Bristol Myers Squibb</funding-source>.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p><italic toggle="yes">Reporting Checklist:</italic> The authors have completed the STROBE reporting checklist.
