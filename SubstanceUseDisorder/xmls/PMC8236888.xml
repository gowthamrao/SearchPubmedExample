Meanwhile, lung malignant tumors are classified into small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abedi Gaballu et al., 2019</xref>). NSCLC accounts for over 80% of lung cancers, and about 80% of patients are found usually in the advanced stages of NSCLC (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen Y. et al., 2020</xref>). Great attentions have been paid to treat NSCLC, while the effect is still not ideal (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Iwama et al., 2020</xref>). Thereby, it is necessary to find new methods for NSCLC treatment.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous RNAs featured by a closed cyclic structure (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, miRNAs are known to exert their biological functions <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> regulation of the target mRNAs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). This greatly modulates the cellular process, including cell growth (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bengone-Abogourin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Torma et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, miRNAs are involved in NSCLC progression. For instance, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">He (2017)</xref> indicated that downregulation of miR-15a could promote the development and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of NSCLC cells; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al. (2018)</xref> revealed that miR-9 could attenuate the symptom of NSCLC. Therefore, miRNAs can play important roles in NSCLC. However, the functions of miRNAs in NSCLC need to be further explored.</p><p>Previous reports have revealed that the association between tumor cells and stroma cells in tumor microenvironment can play a key role in modulating the development of cancer (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zeng and Fu, 2020</xref>). In tumor environment, macrophages are often associated with tumor cells to regulate tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Ilyas, 2020</xref>). In addition, the macrophages of the tumor environment showing oncogenic effects are considered as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which usually exhibit M2 phenotype (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dessouki et al., 2020</xref>). The correlation between tumor cells and TAMs has been revealed some cancers (gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, et al.) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the detailed association between NSCLC treatments with TAMs is unclear.</p><p>In this study, we sought to investigate the differentially expressed miRNAs which are associated with the development of NSCLC.

On the other hand, we used targetscan database and found that MAP3K1 was the target of miR-770. Thereby, our study indicated that miR-770 could regulate the tumorigenesis of NSCLC through targeting other mRNAs. Meanwhile, Yongmei <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2017)</xref> found that activation of MAP3K1 and JNK signaling could promote the EMT process. Our study was consistent to Yongmei Chang et al., suggesting that tumor cell-derived exosomal miR-770 inhibits the tumorigenesis and EMT process of NSCLC through targeting MAP3K1.</p><p>Of course, there are some shortcomings in this research as follows: (1) rescue experiments need to be performed to further verify the role of MAPK signaling in exosomes-mediated tumor cell growth; (2) more mRNAs targeted by miR-770 are needed to be explored; (3) the function of MAP3K1 in NSCLC <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> remains unclear. Thereby, more investigations are needed in the coming future.</p><p>In conclusion, tumor cell-derived exosomal miR-770 inhibits M2 macrophage polarization <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> targeting MAP3K1. Therefore, our study shed new lights on exploring the new strategies for the treatment of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by Ethical Committee of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XL and GM conceived and supervised the study.
