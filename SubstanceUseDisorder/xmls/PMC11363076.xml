Broadly speaking, deaths by suicide in Scotland have been increasing since 2014 after a period of decline since the 1990s,<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with notable increases in the 15&#8211;24 age bracket, and a decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Deaths by suicide are relatively rare outcomes, particularly in children, but they are indicative of a larger population vulnerable to suicide with self-harm and mental ill health being known risk factors for suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This population vulnerability is a growing problem with the prevalence of both self-harm and poor mental health increasing in recent years.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Childhood adversity has also been reported as a risk factor for suicide,<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> with a confirmed strong dose-response relationship between types and &#8216;dose&#8217; of adversity.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, these associations have yet to be confirmed with a lifespan health data study that can explore associations between childhood adversity and future suicidal behaviour. Previous studies have found higher rates of service use, including hospitalisations, in children who had experienced adversity.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Understanding health service contacts for childhood adversity unaffected by recall bias may provide opportunities for earlier suicide prevention interventions in childhood and adolescence before suicidal behaviour emerges. We hypothesised that people who died by suicide had more frequent admissions for childhood adversity and mental health, including admissions for self-harm. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate patterns of lifespan hospital contacts for childhood adversities, mental health status and suicidal behaviour prior to later young person suicide.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1"><title>Ethics and consent statement</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 1 (REC) on 4 May 2018 with REC reference 18/NS/0054.

All recorded diagnoses were used to code admissions, including the &#8216;main&#8217; and up to five &#8216;other&#8217; diagnoses, as well as diagnoses at admission, or discharge, in psychiatric records. Adverse events were operationalised in two ways: (1) maltreatment or violence-related codes (MVR)<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> for admissions before age 18, or (2) codes <italic toggle="yes">suggestive</italic> of maltreatment<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> for age &lt;10. Mental health-related (mental health) codes were defined as codes listed in Clinical Classifications Software (CCS):<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>this covered ICD-9 and ICD-10 Chapter V (Mental and behavioural disorders), ICD-9 codes E950-E959 and ICD-10 codes X60-X84, Y870 for Self-harm (see Supplementary Table 2), as well as individual codes in other chapters; mental ill health was thus broadly defined, including self-harm and alcohol- and substance-use diagnoses (see Supplementary Table 9 for the most frequent diagnoses, and Supplementary spreadsheet for complete list of inclusions). We used CCS as a semi-automated way to harmonise ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes through time. An additional rationale for using the CCS broad mental health definition was that by capturing a wide range of admissions, we might identify the best opportunities by admission type or pattern for healthcare staff to intervene earlier with suicide prevention measures.</p><p>In addition to the protocol-defined codes we included: codes indicating poisoning (accidental and &#8216;undetermined intent&#8217;); hospitalisations with residence codes in the &#8216;Admission from&#8217; or &#8216;Discharge to&#8217; fields, indicative of homelessness or &#8216;care experience&#8217; (codes indicating foster care, care homes or residential institutions; see Supplementary Table 7).

Relative order of adverse events and mental health diagnoses was determined for individuals &lt;18 years using frequencies and odds ratios. Two conditional logistic regression models were fitted using suicide as outcome, stratified by sex assigned at birth. Model 1 included categorical variables for type and number of adverse events and mental health diagnoses prior to age 18, as explanatory variables to ascertain the relative strength of associations with suicide of different adverse events and mental health admissions. Model 2 tested for an interaction between adverse events and mental health admissions, and included continuous variables for number of types of adverse events, number of mental health admissions before age 18 and their interaction. Age and postcode-derived variables were excluded from the models because of being constant within each stratum of cases and controls as a result of case-control matching, and consequently non-estimable.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Demographic data</title><p>Data were extracted on 7505 individuals who died by suicide in Scotland (&#8216;cases&#8217;) in the period 1991&#8211;2017, of whom 2477 were born in 1981 or later and potentially had lifetime records available (see <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for summary of exclusions; <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for characteristics of cohort).

There was a deprivation gradient, with 37.8 and 29.4% of cases in the most deprived quintile for SIMD and Carstairs Index variables, respectively. Most cases (88.6%) and controls (87.9%) lived in urban areas of Scotland using NRS 2-fold classification,<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> slightly more than 83% of the corresponding national population data. Psychiatric in-patient admissions represented 11.6% of lifetime in-patient admissions accrued by cases, a factor of 8.3 times more than the 1.4% accrued by controls (see <xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cases accrued more diagnoses from ICD chapters for &#8216;Mental disorders&#8217; and &#8216;Injury and poisoning&#8217; (with associated &#8216;External causes&#8217;) in their lifetime records than controls (see Supplementary Table 8).

violence-related; frequencies of individuals with MVR diagnosis, diagnosis suggestive of maltreatment (Schnitzer), and mental health-related diagnosis, or experience of maternal death. Age group was determined at the individual's first diagnosis of each kind of adversity. Diagnoses in any position were included. Admissions related to death were excluded. The denominator is the number of &#8216;cases&#8217; or &#8216;controls&#8217; with records prior to death, broken down by sex, respectively. Note that codes suggestive of maltreatment or neglect were only defined for ages &lt;10. Mental health-related diagnoses before age 10 were very rare and are not shown. There is a small degree of overlap between MVR, codes suggestive of maltreatment or neglect, and mental health-related diagnoses, specifically with respect to rarely used external cause codes for events of undetermined intent. Maternal death was counted only for individuals with hospital records prior to death, and only when the mother died prior to the death of the individual (or the equivalent date in controls); not all individuals could be linked to their mothers&#8217; records so this is likely an underestimate of bereavement; however, the same denominator was used as for other types of adversity for comparison. Place of residence indicating care experience was not reported separately by sex due to small numbers.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Maltreatment and violence-related (MVR) admissions were rarely recorded before age 10, with 1.7% cases (35/2106) versus 1.0% controls (140/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;1.62 (95% CI, 1.12&#8211;2.36); in 10&#8211;17 year-olds they were found for 7.6% cases (160/2106) versus 2.7% controls (371/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;2.93 (95% CI, 2.42&#8211;3.55). Using the larger denominator of individuals with or without lifetime hospitalisations had the effect of increasing the odds ratios (see Discussion).</p><p>Mental health admissions for those under 10 were too sparse to report. Mental health admissions aged 10&#8211;17 were more common, found in 21.7% cases (458/2106) versus 4.1% of controls (560/13&#160;589), a factor of 5.3&#160;times&#160;higher and odds ratio&#160;=&#160;6.47 (95% CI, 5.66&#8211;7.39). Cases had a higher rate of mental health diagnoses than controls (see Supplementary Table 9 for breakdown by diagnosis types) &#8211; this was particularly acute for female cases where 29.6% (150/507) had an intentional self-inflicted injury diagnosis in in-patient records (combined general and psychiatric hospital) before age 18, odds ratio =&#160;11.91 (95% CI, 9.06&#8211;15.66). Self-inflicted injury and alcohol-related disorders were the most common mental health-related diagnoses. Approximately 80% of mental health admissions were recorded in general hospitals.</p><p>Maternal death before age 18 was more common for cases with 2.7% (58/2106) affected, compared with 1.4% controls (188/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;2.02 (95% CI, 1.50&#8211;2.72). Admissions coded with a place of residence indicative of &#8216;care experience&#8217; before age 18 more were found for 2.9% cases (62/2106), versus 0.4% controls (53/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;7.75 (95% CI, 5.5&#8211;11.21). Very few individuals with place of residence were coded as &#8216;no fixed abode&#8217;, so this code was combined with care-related codes before age 18 to form a single place of residence-related adversity variable in Models 1 and 2.</p><p>MVR and mental health-related codes included poisoning diagnoses, so we investigated poisonings by intent (see Supplementary Table 10). Intentional poisonings (included under the mental health category of &#8216;Self-inflicted injury&#8217;) were more common in cases than controls, with 27.4% female cases (139/507) and 8.0% male cases (128/1599) having such diagnoses, compared with 3.2% female controls (98/3052) and 0.8% male controls (87/10&#160;537); odds ratio<sub>female</sub>&#160;=&#160;11.39 (95% CI, 8.60&#8211;15.07) and odds ratio<sub>male</sub>&#160;= 10.45 (95% CI, 7.92&#8211;13.80). For data relating to admissions aged &lt;10, accidental and undetermined intent poisonings were combined because of small numbers and were more common with 4.0% cases (84/2106) compared with 2.8% controls, (374/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;1.47 (95% CI, 1.15&#8211;1.87). This ratio increased in individuals aged 10 to 17, with 3.3% of cases (69/2106) having such diagnoses compared with 0.4% of controls (57/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;8.04 (95% CI, 5.64&#8211;11.46).</p><p>Codes suggestive of maltreatment or neglect before age 10 occurred more frequently but were similar between groups with 14.6% cases (307/2106) versus 15.0% controls (2042/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;0.96 (95% CI, 0.85&#8211;1.10). These proportions decreased to 3.5% cases (74/2106) and 2.7% controls (366/13&#160;589), odds ratio&#160;=&#160;1.32 (95% CI, 1.02&#8211;1.70) when we excluded dental caries diagnoses (see Supplementary file).</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-3"><title>Relative order of hospital presentation for adverse events and mental health diagnoses</title><p>Frequencies and odds ratios for the relative impact of order of first presentation for adverse events and/or mental health along the lifespan were estimated (see <xref rid="tab04" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Of the possible admission combinations, in order of decreasing frequency, the proportion of cases (combined sexes) had lifetime admissions as follows: for &#8216;mental health only&#8217; 13.5% (286/2106); for &#8216;adverse event admissions only&#8217; 9.5% (201/2106); for &#8216;adverse events admissions first, mental health admission second&#8217; 3.8% (81/2106); both co-occurring (within 28 days) 2.9% (62/2106); &#8216;mental health admission first, adverse event second&#8217; 2.4% (50/2106). In individuals who experienced both adverse events and mental health admissions, adversity before mental health admission was generally more frequent than mental health admission first followed by adverse event, and the difference in frequency was more pronounced in females, though the number of individuals affected was very small.

We ranked the relative impact of types of adverse events and mental health diagnoses: when the effects of childhood adversities and mental health diagnoses were adjusted for in a conditional logistic regression (Model 1), the strongest association in both sexes was for mental health admissions, followed in males by two or more MVR admissions, maternal bereavement, accidental poisoning and one MVR admission, and in females by maternal bereavement, admissions indicating care experience or no fixed abode, and one MVR admission.</p><p>A dose-response effect was evident for mental health admissions with odds increasing with the number of admissions from one to three or more in both sexes; for MVR admissions, the evidence for a dose-response was mixed: in males, there was an increase from having one admission, aOR<sub>male</sub>&#160;=&#160;1.47 (95% CI, 1.15&#8211;1.88), to having two or more, aOR<sub>male</sub>&#160;=&#160;1.82 (95% CI, 1.09&#8211;3.02), but not in females, where there was no significant effect of having two or more MVR admissions.</p><p>When we investigated the effect of the number of types of adversity and of mental health admissions in Model 2, each adversity type multiplied the odds of suicide by 1.9 in males, and 2.65 in females, and each mental health admission multiplied the odds of suicide by 2.06 in males and 1.78 in females. In males there was a significant interaction factor of 0.76 for individuals who experienced both adversity and mental health admissions, meaning that the combined effect of experiencing both adversity and mental health admissions was less than the sum of the individual effects (but still greater than either of the individual effects).</p><p>A rudimentary analysis of the relative occurrence of childhood adversities versus mental health admissions showed that individuals experiencing adversity followed by mental health admissions were somewhat more frequent than those experiencing both within 28 days, or with mental health admission first followed by adversity. This finding together with the negative interaction (Model 2) between the number of types of adversity and the number of mental health admissions in males, points towards a potential mediation effect, i.e. mental health admissions being protective against suicide in individuals who experienced adversity.</p><p>Presentations coded for adverse events and mental health admissions were rare in childhood (age &lt;10) and were more common in adolescence (ages 10&#8211;17). We found hospital data before age 10 were sparse and could not identify sub-groups of children with increased vulnerability to later suicide, so the regression analysis used admissions aged 0&#8211;18.</p><p>A supplementary logistic regression model investigating &#8216;subcategories&#8217; of MVR and mental health admissions (see Supplementary Tables 14 and 15) revealed that the type of MVR most strongly associated with suicide was &#8216;assault or maltreatment&#8217;, and the type of mental health admission most strongly associated with suicide was self-harm, followed by alcohol-related admissions in females, and non-alcohol-nor-self-harm admissions (NANSHR) in males.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-2"><title>Comparisons with other studies</title><p>We found a 3:1 ratio of male to female deaths by suicide, but females accrued 31.5% of all hospitalisations, or 36.3% of psychiatric admissions; a similar study in Wales also found that females who died by suicide had more contacts than males across primary and secondary care settings.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In controls, females accrued 23.0% of hospitalisations, or 28.6% of psychiatric admissions.</p><p>A previous study of suicide in Scotland between 1981 and 2009 of persons of all ages<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> found that men died earlier than women, but in the younger cohort as per this study, men died approximately six months later on average (see <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for details).</p><p>Sexual assault was recorded very rarely, despite its strong association with suicide found in other studies.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Most adversities and mental health diagnoses were recorded in general hospital rather than during psychiatric admissions, though cases accrued more psychiatric admissions than controls (11.6% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic>. 1.4% of all admissions).</p><p>Codes suggestive of maltreatment or neglect were not associated with suicide after adjusting for other adversities. Unlike the original study,<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> we additionally omitted the use of dental caries diagnoses as suggestive of neglect (see Supplementary file for details) and also found no effect after adjustment.</p><p>We found previously identified strong associations between suicide and mental health diagnoses, alcohol misuse, drug misuse and self-harm;<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> these are potentially explained by the severity of such contacts in secondary care.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Future studies could assess measures of severity of presentations, e.g. by including length of stay in hospital.</p><p>Of the adversities studied, MVR adversity was relatively common among adolescents, with 7.7% of cases having experienced their first episode aged 10&#8211;17. In male adolescents this was mainly accounted for by assaults. The experience of violence and its association with suicide should be given more priority in both research and policy, as has been highlighted elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Our study was not able to detect when victims of violence were also perpetrators; victimisation has been associated with later violence and psychological distress,<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and both victimisation and perpetration have been associated with suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We analysed up to 36 years of lifespan hospital admissions due to availability of data from 1981. Controls were defined as individuals alive at the time of their matched cases&#8217; death, so it is possible that controls included some individuals who died by suicide after the study period.</p><p>Individuals with at least one hospitalisation prior to death, and their matched controls, were used as the denominator in computing odds ratios, to reflect hospital admission as a potential focus for suicide intervention. This was used instead of the total number of cases and controls identified, the consequence being that our reported odds ratios were lower but more easily interpretable. The alternative would have resulted in even higher odds ratios for childhood adversity due to the differing proportions of cases versus controls with any lifetime hospitalisations (approximately 85 and 55% for cases and controls, respectively).</p><p>Patient identifiers were extracted from patient registrations, which is considered the most complete register of persons in Scotland<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>; hospital records had high degree of completeness (between 93&#8211;99% during 2004&#8211;2006 and 2010&#8211;2011 assessments,<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and 99% in 2017<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>), so it is reasonable to assume that an individual with no hospitalisations genuinely had none, rather than representing a case of failed linkage. The difference in hospitalisations between cases and controls is therefore unlikely to represent a form of selection bias.</p><p>Despite our attempt at producing a highly sensitive set of criteria for adverse experiences recorded in hospitalisations, we found a low rate of adverse experiences, consistent with other studies<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and a consensus view that this is because of under-recording: only a subset of adverse experiences are recorded in hospital, reflecting relatively severe physical manifestations of adversity (&#8216;tip of the iceberg&#8217;). This is compounded by the lack of diagnostic categories for possible or suspected maltreatment or neglect; clinicians may lack training or experience, have concerns about services being able to respond adequately, have concerns about clinician-family interactions or think recording maltreatment would do more harm than good.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Similarly, we only identified a small number of adversities before age 10, which reflects how and what adversities are recorded in in-patient records rather than a true rate of adversities for this age group, which are likely to be far higher. In-patient records likely captured only relatively severe mental health presentations and presentations at a relatively higher age. Incorporating primary care data would provide an opportunity to include earlier and less severe presentations than those seen in hospital, potentially with different patterns than the relatively severe presentations studied here. National out-patient and primary care data were not available at the same level of quality or for the duration of the study period, but could be considered in future studies to capture less severe recorded adversity, depending on availability.</p><p>Because of the scarcity of adversity records, we collapsed all admissions before age 18 into a single category, precluding an analysis of the timing of adversity or mental health admission. Future studies could investigate this using a longitudinal approach, or e.g. time-to-event analysis.</p><p>Self-harm coding in ICD-9 and ICD-10 cannot distinguish cases of suicidal intent from other kinds of self-harm. Suicidal ideation can be coded (R45.8 in ICD-10) but was practically never used in the extracted data so we could not distinguish suicidal behaviours from thoughts. Self-harm coding was therefore very crude and encompassed a range of behaviours that may show different risk profiles when disentangled.<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Controls were matched to cases on death certificate postcode to control for (postcode-derived) individual level deprivation and rurality. Consequently, we controlled for ecological fallacy at the time of death but were unable to estimate effects of deprivation or rurality.</p><p>Our analysis of the relative order of occurrence of first presentations for childhood adversity and mental health admissions showed that adverse event admissions followed by mental health admissions were somewhat more frequent than vice versa. Together with the negative interaction between number of types of adversity and number of mental health admissions in males, they point towards a mediation effect between the two, though the present analysis could not determine the exact nature of the effect. Specifically, individuals with more than one type of adversity, and individuals with both adversity and mental health admissions, were rare. Further studies could improve sensitivity by combining additional data sources, such as community health data, with further mediation or interaction analyses in a causal framework (e.g.<sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-4"><title>Implications for research</title><p>Consensus among data researchers<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> is that adversities are underreported in administrative data, and this was also observed in this hospital admission data study. Previous research improved on this by cross-referencing data against specialist data-sets such as the Trauma Audit &amp; Research Network (TARN) data collection,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or child protection services&#8217; data<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> including information on social care involvement. Further research should explore the possibility of including social work records, and data on &#8216;looked after children&#8217; which our study (though using very sparse data) indicated as a vulnerable group. Community health data also likely contains presentations for adverse events, as well as mild/moderate severity mental ill health presentations, and would be an important addition to data linkage.</p><p>The impact of adversity on school performance and exclusions, and their associations with suicide, can be studied by including education data.<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Potential also exists for further exploring maternal records, including MVR with mental health admissions. Finally, paternal record linkage to birth records and maternal records described in our protocol<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> would allow a move towards a more complete picture of intergenerational adversity and its effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-5"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p>Healthcare providers should prioritise suicide prevention activity in adolescents admitted as in-patients or day cases with childhood adversity (coded as violence and maltreatment) <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> mental health presentations in in-patient hospital records (general and/or psychiatric hospitals), as both were associated with greater odds of subsequent young person suicide.

There is a window of opportunity for healthcare practitioners to identify and flag potential &#8216;at-risk&#8217; adolescents to engage in early intervention, and preventive and supportive actions to prevent future suicidal acts. Attention by healthcare professionals in general hospital settings should include greater scrutiny of poisonings coded as accidental, as these were associated with later suicide and likely represented a mixture of intentional and accidental poisonings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="sm01" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Dougall et al. supplementary material 1</title><p>Dougall et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="S2056472424000693sup001.docx" id="d67e2637" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sm02" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Dougall et al. supplementary material 2</title><p>Dougall et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="S2056472424000693sup002.xlsx" id="d67e2642" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the substantive contribution from the electronic Data Research Innovation Service (eDRIS), Public Health Scotland (formerly NHS Information Services Division); namely Joannes Kerssens, principal analyst, for data knowledge and technical expertise; and Diane Rennie and Alexandra Tolfrey, research managers, for providing procedural oversight and study support.
