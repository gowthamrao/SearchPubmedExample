Multimodal pain management with regional anesthesia, particularly by delivery of local anesthetics using a paravertebral catheter (PVC), has been shown to reduce pain in operations involving thoracotomy incisions. However, few studies have reported high-quality safety and efficacy outcomes of PVCs following MICS.</p></sec><sec id="section2-15569845231190638"><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who underwent MICS at Vancouver General Hospital between 2016 and 2019 (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 123) were reviewed for perioperative opioid-narcotic use. Primary outcomes were postoperative opioid use and hospital length of stay (LOS). Statistical analyses were performed using univariate and multivariable regression models to determine independent risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="section3-15569845231190638"><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 54 patients received routine systemic analgesia (control), 53 patients received a paravertebral catheter (PVC), and 16 patients received another mode of regional analgesia (non-PVC). The mean hospital LOS was significantly different in patients in the PVC group at 5.8 &#177; 2.0 days versus 8.3 &#177; 7.1 days in the control and 6.6 &#177; 2.3 days in the non-PVC group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.033). The percentage of patients who did not require postoperative oxycodone was significantly higher in the PVC group (48.1%), compared with the control (24.5%) and non-PVC (37.5%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.043) groups.</p></sec><sec id="section4-15569845231190638"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The administration of regional anesthesia using PVCs was associated with reduced need for opioids and a shorter LOS. The reduction in postoperative opioids may reduce the risk of potential opioid dependency in this population. Future studies should involve randomized controlled trials with systematic evaluation of pain scores to verify current study results.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

The non-PVC group included patients who received a single injection of local anesthetic as either a PV block (PVB) or erector spinae block (ESB) and patients who had an erector spinae catheter placed. The type of regional anesthesia used in any given patient was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, and all of the options listed above were used during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="section9-15569845231190638"><title>Anesthetic Protocol</title><p>The PVC group had a PVC inserted on the side of surgery before the induction of anesthesia. PVC placement was performed in the operating room prior to induction of anesthesia by an anesthesiologist trained in ultrasound or landmark-based placement with the patient in the sitting position. A linear ultrasound probe was placed in the parasagittal plane to find the transverse process at the fourth thoracic vertebrae. Local anesthetic was administered in the skin, and a 17 gauge Tuohy needle was inserted into the paravertebral space under ultrasound guidance. The desired endpoint of needle insertion was either direct needle visualization deep to the costotransverse ligament in the paravertebral space and/or depression of the parietal pleura upon injection of saline.</p><p>In patients with a body habitus that impeded adequate ultrasonography of the paravertebral space, a landmark-based technique was used. The paravertebral space was estimated 2.5 cm from the midline, and the Tuohy needle was advanced either cephalad or caudad off the transverse process to a successful endpoint as determined by the anesthesiologist. Following confirmation of successful needle placement, a stiff, non&#8211;wire-bound catheter was inserted into the paravertebral space to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. The catheter was bolused with 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine.</p><p>Standard anesthetic protocols included a balanced anesthetic induction with propofol, rocuronium, and an opioid: sufentanil, fentanyl, or hydromorphone. The maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with inhalational anesthesia, a sufentanil infusion at 0.2 to 0.5 &#181;g/kg/h, or intermittent boluses of fentanyl or hydromorphone. An infusion of propofol or dexmedetomidine was used during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and as sedation for transfer to the post&#8211;cardiac surgery unit. Most patients received a second bolus of 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine at the end of the procedure.</p><p>In the postoperative setting, patients in the catheter-based groups received a background infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 2 mL/h, with patient or nurse-controlled boluses of 8 mL as often as every hour. Catheters were typically removed on postoperative day 2 or 3 at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Patients received acetaminophen 650 mg oral QID for 7 days as well as hydromorphone or oxycodone PRN for pain control. In patients without a contraindication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were also provided. The first-line oral NSAID used was naproxen 250 mg oral BID PRN.</p></sec><sec id="section10-15569845231190638"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Data were collected through internal hospital records, following the institution&#8217;s research ethics guidelines. Basic patient demographics, time to extubation, intraoperative and postoperative opioid use, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were recorded. Time to extubation (min) was defined as the time between operating room exit to extubation time. For patients who were extubated in the operating room, time to extubation was calculated as the time from skin closure to operating room exit. Hospital LOS (days) was defined as the date of operation to date of discharge. Opioid usage was converted to morphine equivalents (micrograms) for comparison between anesthetics (hydromorphone, sufentanil, fentanyl, and oxycodone). Primary outcomes of the study included LOS and postoperative opioid use.</p></sec><sec id="section11-15569845231190638"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Description of the baseline cohort characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative comorbidities were presented for the respective groups. Discrete variables were summarized by frequencies and percentages. Percentages were calculated according to the number of patients. Continuous variables were summarized with mean &#177; standard deviation or median and interquartile interval (P25, P75). The 3 groups were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher&#8217;s exact test for categorical variables and Student&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables, as appropriate.</p><p>To explore an appropriate statistical model, the distribution of the outcome was checked from the histogram and the description. Since LOS was overdispersed, a negative binomial regression model was used to explain the relationship between the covariates and hospital LOS. Due to the right-skewed distribution, the relationship between covariates and time to extubation or total postoperative opioid use was explored using nonlinear regression analysis based on logarithm transformation on the outcomes. Analysis of oxycodone use required logistic regression. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were used to explore potential risk factors.</p><p>The variables considered to be adjusted in the regression models were as follows: demographic factors (age, sex, body mass index [BMI]), preoperative risk factors (urgency of surgery, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], atrial fibrillation (Afib), smoking, hypertension), intraoperative (total surgery time, CPB time, cross-clamp [XC] time), and postoperative comorbidities (estimated glomerular filtration rate, postoperative Afib/arrhythmia).</p><p>All of the model selections were developed by incorporating all variables using multiple model selection procedures (both stepwise selection and backward elimination techniques) with statistical significance of inclusion at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#8804; 0.20 and exclusion at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05.

Early in our experience, the optimal method of delivering regional anesthesia was not clearly established at our center nor in the literature. There are several other ways of providing regional anesthesia to the chest wall, including intercostal nerve blocks, intrapleural blocks, serratus anterior plane (SAP) block, and ESB.</p><p>The intercostal nerve blocks are arguably easiest to perform and involve injection of local anesthetic into the intercostal muscles between the relevant ribs.<sup>

</sup> This was the only method of regional anesthesia used at our center for many years and was felt to be minimally effective at reducing postoperative pain. However, more recently, some centers have used intercostal nerve cryoablation, where high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> or nitrous oxide are used to cool the intercostal nerves to &#8722;50 to &#8722;70 &#176;C, with good pain control, decreased hospital LOS, and postoperative opioid consumption.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup></p><p>For intrapleural blocks, the local anesthetic is inserted via a catheter between the visceral and parietal pleura. When compared with TEA, intrapleural blocks have been shown to provide superior pain relief; however, careful placement and manipulation of the catheter by the surgical team was required.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>In the case of SAP blocks, the local anesthetic is injected between the serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi muscle.

</sup></p><p>From our anecdotal experience with several of these strategies, including PVB, ESB, and ESC, it soon became clinically evident to the anesthesiologists and nurses that those who had a properly functioning PVC had the best pain control. Therefore, PVC-based regional anesthesia became the preferred approach over the course of 2018.</p><p>Despite its theoretically proposed benefits, current literature on the effects of PVC in MICS patients is limited. Many studies show small total sample sizes (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> &lt; 100), lack a control group, have limited parameters to determine efficacy, or are not randomized.</p><p>Although this is a single-center retrospective review of the application of regional anesthesia techniques in patients undergoing MICS, it represents a continuous series of patients who had surgery in a contemporary time span. Furthermore, this study is one of the most recent reports with a large control group and a comparatively larger sample size that examines both intraoperative and postoperative parameters.</p><p>Pain scores were not systematically collected at consistent time points, and therefore, the quality of pain score data was not optimal. However, anecdotally, patients were more comfortable with a PVC, and this was reflected in their significantly decreased postoperative oral oxycodone use, which is an important clinical indication of improved patient-perceived pain. In fact, it has become the standard of practice to place PVCs in patients undergoing MICS at our institution, despite the added procedural time, because the observed reduction in postoperative pain was clearly evident. These results are despite the fact that not all patients in the PVC group had a catheter that worked well. There is still heterogeneity among the anesthesiologists in terms of their ability to place properly functioning catheters despite the use of ultrasound, which has been the standard of practice since approximately 2010.</p><p>With regard to time to extubation, it was not surprising to us to witness faster times to endotracheal extubation in the PVC group, as it has been demonstrated that the use of multimodal analgesia does contribute to earlier extubation times.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Opioid-sparing anesthesia techniques, including regional or neuraxial techniques,<sup><xref rid="bibr31-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="bibr32-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr33-15569845231190638" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> are now components of many ERAS protocols and have been proven to decrease time to endotracheal extubation.</p><p>In addition to postoperative pain, the opioid crisis is an ongoing public health care problem that has contributed to an epidemic of drug-related overdose deaths.<sup>
