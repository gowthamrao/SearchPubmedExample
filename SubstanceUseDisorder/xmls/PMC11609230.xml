Internationally, other professionals such as clinical psychologists, social workers, and those in government roles (such as employment officers) can be part of social prescribing services. Link workers offer signposting and referrals to local community groups or services (such as art, museum or green-based initiatives).<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Depending on need, they also could refer to resources such as social workers, psychotherapists or psychologists in government institutions or private practices.</p><sec id="sec0002"><title>Primary care presentations to urgent and emergency care</title><p id="para0002">Patients often present to urgent and emergency care (UEC) services with low-acuity physical health, mental health or social conditions that could be more appropriately managed in primary care.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This is problematic when pressure on accessing healthcare services has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, funding cuts, workforce strikes and the lack of staff recruitment.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There are a multitude of reasons that contribute to patient decision-making on which healthcare service to access when in need of care. Individual factors, such as misconceptions about service provision and a perceived need for a quick response to a low-acuity condition, can impact choice.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Factors related to the social determinants of health such as debt, housing, food or digital poverty also contribute to increased utilisation of both emergency departments.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The intersectionality between various social determinants of health is increasingly recognised as contributing to inequalities in both access to and experience of emergency care.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> There is also a lack of information about local resources, accessibility of services and treatment options available from different providers that increase the attendance at UEC. These factors could potentially be addressed at the individual level through educational materials, or at the service level such as improving access to community services. However, all options need significant additional funding to be allocated to services in the community that provide social prescriptions.</p><p id="para0003">To deliver social prescribing in a holistic way, there is a generic pathway in the UK NHS (summarised in <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) referred to as the Link Worker Holistic Model.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This social prescribing pathway is person-centred, with a link worker working with the patient to identify their priorities.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><fig id="fig0001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Typical social prescribing pathway.</p><p>Blue shaded boxes &#8211; self-referral pathway.

Additionally, there are calls to extend social prescribing to non-primary healthcare settings, such as community groups. In the UK, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives recently recognised that ambulance services have a role to play in improving public health, which includes involvement in social prescribing.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> To date, there has only been one research study known to the authors specifically examining the potential role of social prescribing in the UEC system,<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with others examining broader access to social resources.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> While awareness of social prescribing was limited amongst UEC staff, they almost exclusively perceived it as being a suitable intervention for UEC patients to reduce frequent or inappropriate use of ambulance services. However, this was subject to overcoming considerable barriers across the macro, meso and micro levels of the health and social care system, which are also considered later in this paper. Other interventions in UEC have attempted to reduce frequent attendance, such as hotspotting (an approach to identify frequent-attending patients) in America or community paramedicine in Canada, which have had mixed results in demonstrating an impact on UEC use.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="para0005">To provide person-centred care that appropriately addresses an individual patient&#8217;s non-medical needs, UEC services could benefit from formalised access to community support. Social prescribing is one such approach, delivered in addition to or instead of medical care depending on the patients&#8217; individual circumstances, for supporting people who access UEC who have needs that are better managed within their local community and primary care context.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Social prescribing pathways and interventions in urgent and emergency care</title><p id="para0006">A hypothetical UEC social prescribing route is outlined in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Social prescribing could become an option at triage for all entry points into the healthcare system, such as emergency medical service numbers (999 / 911) for life-threatening emergencies or pharmacies based within the community. The social prescribing pathway should also be flexible enough to allow for access during any point of contact with the patient during an episode of care, from medical assessment through to medical treatment decisions &#8211; similar to other opportunistic public health interventions.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Examples include paramedics conversing with a patient during EMS conveyance to hospital, or physicians speaking with patients during shared decision-making discussions in relation to treatments.<fig id="fig0002" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Conceptual social prescribing model in urgent and emergency care.</p><p>Blue shaded boxes &#8211; self-referral pathway.

The possible benefits to people in UEC were reported unanimously by UEC staff for addressing social issues such as loneliness and social isolation.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Introducing social prescribing into UEC requires the consideration of staff who could be involved in social prescribing, the patients who could benefit, and ultimately where patients could be referred or signposted to in their local community.</p><p id="para0008">Active signposting by link workers would consist of informing patients about appropriate services that they may be able to access (ie self-refer), which may be done verbally with support of pre-existing written material on relevant services or resources (eg debt management). In the UEC setting, patients could be made aware of relevant services; where this is a telephone-based service, it would most likely be provided verbally, and any face-to-face contact could include provision of written material. Direct referral, on the other hand, would involve a link worker based in UEC referring people to existing community or statutory service support. This would be based on an assessment of their needs, and a shared decision-making discussion around the options available for a social prescription. Direct referrals would be followed up by a link worker to encourage attendance and establish the referral&#8217;s appropriateness. If more support was required, or there was a need for long-term follow-up, a referral could be made to primary care-based social prescribing services.</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><title>Implementation of social prescribing in urgent and emergency care</title><p id="para0009">The suitability of the options of social prescribing implementation depends on who would be responsible for social prescribing. Specific link worker(s) in UEC services would be a viable option to triage patients at the scene or remotely supported by telecare. This would provide support for the patient almost immediately, and they would have the option for a referral to primary care or the third sector (voluntary, community, faith and social enterprise organisations). For instance, in the emergency department there could be a dedicated person who is responsible for social prescribing (among other preventative public health measures), while in an emergency medical service it could be someone based within a clinical assessment centre where people, in the UK, are currently referred with an uncertain disposition.</p><p id="para0010">Where patients are directly referred for a social prescription at a community organisation, this should depend on a trained assessment of the person&#8217;s own unique circumstances. This assessment should incorporate a holistic understanding of their wider health and social needs (such as housing, financial etc) and types of organisation that are able and willing to provide social prescriptions. This would provide a tailored response to the patient for an individual who does not require medical treatment.</p><p id="para0011">One approach to accessing social prescribing in UEC could be to incorporate social prescribing into other systems that are being designed to facilitate integrated care between UEC services. In England, a single point of access (SPoA) system, where practitioners from multiple services can access patient records, advice, guidance and support for onward referral, has been suggested to improve patient flow and reduce avoidable care by simplifying access to urgent care.<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Incorporating social prescribing into a SPoA would provide additional opportunities for addressing social conditions across a broad range of UEC services, while centralising the social prescribing expertise. Integration of patients&#8217; electronic care records between UEC services would further facilitate a holistic, person-centred approach by the link worker,<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and could contribute to the delivery of a &#8216;neighbourhood NHS&#8217; via multidisciplinary working, as highlighted by Darzi&#8217;s independent investigation of the NHS in England (2024).<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, delivering social prescribing remotely will introduce additional uncertainty; in-person delivery is reported to be preferred by service users,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic where moving to a remote-based service led to initial improvements in access to services, but difficulties in establishing a rapport between the patient and link worker.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec0006"><title>Potential benefits of social prescribing in urgent and emergency care</title><p id="para0012">The introduction of a UEC social prescribing pathway could have benefits for the public, professionals and healthcare systems by adding additional support for psychosocial needs. Additionally, if people were supported to manage their health within their local communities through social prescribing, there is potential to reduce the inequity gap in overall attendance at all healthcare settings and this could support more collaborative commissioning. This supports previous research into those who frequently attended emergency departments in Canada and Australia, where there was a need to provide additional community resources and support to improve health management.<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The addition of link workers into the UEC service model has previously demonstrated a positive impact when implemented alongside the integration of primary care GPs in Norway and New Zealand UEC services.<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The addition of social prescribing link workers has potential to support the provision of care and reduce burden on medical UEC services. However, more research is required to understand the patient pathway, and the extent to which social prescribing could improve patient-centred outcomes, patient experience and increase appropriate use of services.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Challenges of implementing social prescribing in urgent and emergency care</title><p id="para0013">The conceptual model that we propose has associated challenges to implementation which must be considered and addressed. Previous research has extensively reported on the lack of awareness of social prescribing in staff and the public with regards to the support that community-based services can offer (additionally impacted by the high volume of turnover in services due to unsustainable funding sources).<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Indeed, this is a challenge identified in UEC services by previous research,<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> so there would need to be a sufficient increase in both public and professional knowledge. As with social prescribing in other settings, it is imperative that the model be prospectively trialled to determine (cost-) effectiveness using outcomes that are reflective of the philosophy of social prescribing, for example using person-centred outcomes and sociality impact. Alternatively, robust evaluation of existing pilot(s) will be required. Either approach would need to examine the impact on equitable access to care, including specific consideration for the aforementioned social determinants of health<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> (and the intersections between the determinants) that characterise people who are likely most suitable for a social prescribing intervention.</p><p id="para0014">A key difference foreseen in the deployment of a UEC pathway for social prescribing is with the alternative operating hours of primary care, which are not available 24 h a day, 7 days a week (although in many countries there is the need to offer &#8216;out-of-hours services&#8217;, which are often not the full range of services available during typical hours). This creates a challenge about how to support those who would benefit from social prescribing when services are not available. To address this, UEC services could benefit from their own social prescribing pathway decoupled from the primary care pathway, but there would need to be further research undertaken to understand feasibility (including acceptance and operationalisation) and implementation. For example, a pharmacist based in the community could refer a patient to a social prescribing telephone service or have written materials about how to contact their local primary care social prescriber. The SPoA<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> may help to address some of these challenges by centralising and integrating a social prescribing pathway in UEC, though further research is a priority on how to integrate care data systems<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> that would facilitate the SPoA.</p><p id="para0015">Irrespective of a UEC service pathway independent from primary care, there needs to be careful consideration given to the triaging of people and the appropriateness of social prescribing as a referral option. As outlined previously, the role of a UEC link worker could provide an option in the triaging of patients, particularly where a SPoA does not exist. <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> provides a conceptual overview of this. If current UEC professionals were to continue to triage people, with the inclusion of social prescribing as an option to refer to, this would mean that typical physiological assessments would identify immediate medical risk. If there was deemed to be no immediate medical risk or the issues were psychological or social factors, a referral could be made to the UEC link worker. Alternatively, patients could enter the UEC social prescribing pathway during any point of routine medical care and not just during the triage process, which would add resilience to the system where there is a risk of missed diagnoses of social conditions relevant for social prescribing.<fig id="fig0003" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Conceptual overview of the UEC link worker as a triage option.</p><p>Green &#8211; non-emergency walk-in/telehealth.

To support the sustainability of social prescribing referrals, there would need to be funding available to the third sector to support funded places. The funding to groups and activities would support the expansion of social prescribing into UEC services and increase capacity of community support networks. In turn, increasing community support networks and community connectiveness could reduce the volume of non-urgent and emergency attendances.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0008"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="para0017">As new innovations in healthcare are developed, it is important to consider where, how and for whom they can be implemented.
