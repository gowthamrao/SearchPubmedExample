</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Optimizing analgesic use in residential aged care services is complex and involves assessing each resident&#8217;s treatment benefits and risks. Unmanaged or undermanaged pain is associated with reduced quality of life, while overuse of analgesics poses a risk to resident wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Complex multimorbidity, polypharmacy and renal impairment correspond to increased susceptibility to analgesic-related adverse drug events (ADEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Evidence-based guidelines recommend acetaminophen (paracetamol) as the first-line analgesic for mild-to-moderate pain in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite a favourable safety profile, earlier pharmacokinetic studies suggest volume of distribution and clearance are reduced by 20% and 38% in frail older adults, potentially increasing the risk of hepatotoxicity at standard therapeutic doses (4000&#160;mg/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent guidelines recommend a maximum dose of 3000&#160;mg/day for frail older adults or those with low body weight (&lt;&#8201;50&#160;kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Opioids are highly prevalent, with five Australian studies reporting that 28&#8211;34% of residents are prescribed regular opioids over periods from 1&#160;week to 1&#160;month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A meta-analysis of previous research reported an association between opioids and falls (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4&#8211;1.9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], with opioids being one of three medication classes implicated in 60% of ADE-related emergency department presentations among older adults in the United States (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An observational study reported older adults receiving &#8805;&#8201;60&#160;mg morphine equivalents (MME)/day were at increased odds of ADEs compared with those receiving &lt;&#8201;60MME/day (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.9&#8211;9.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A US cohort study found the risk of opioid-related ADEs is heightened when receiving multiple opioids and other central nervous system (CNS) medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Opioids are now more prevalent than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in most countries due to the risk of ADEs associated with NSAIDs in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Initiatives to ensure analgesic appropriateness include frequent pain assessment, medication review, and consideration of resident cognitive impairment, frailty, therapeutic goals and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The 2021 Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (AMDA) &#8216;Pain Management in the Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Setting&#8217; guideline provides facility-wide guidance on how to monitor, review and improve pain management practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

In total, 35.6% of all residents were identified as potentially benefiting from a review of their analgesic regimen. While the majority of residents were identified based on the prescribed dose of acetaminophen, 7.8% were identified based on four opioid-related indicators. Female residents and those with a prior fracture were more likely to be identified as potentially benefiting from analgesic review. Residents observed to be in any mild/moderate pain were less likely to be identified compared with residents with no observed pain.</p><p id="Par32">Almost half of residents charted regular acetaminophen were prescribed &gt;&#8201;3000&#160;mg/day, with 88.1% of these residents classified as frail or most frail. The AMDA and other pain management guidelines recommend acetaminophen dose for frail older adults should not exceed 3000&#160;mg/day (2000&#160;mg/day for individuals with impaired liver function) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our research suggests dose adjustment of acetaminophen was uncommon when our data were collected in 2019. Our findings are comparable with another Australian study in 2019 that reported 150 (62.5%) of 240 older hospital inpatients were prescribed acetaminophen at higher than recommended doses (&gt;&#8201;3000&#160;mg/day or &#8805;&#8201;60&#160;mg/kg/day for patients with a body weight &lt;&#8201;50&#160;kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Overall, 18.8% of residents received opioid doses &gt;&#8201;60&#160;MME/day. Despite increasing long-term dose requirements due to opioid tolerance, there is little evidence to support improved clinical outcomes with higher doses and more evidence regarding harms, including falls and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Of residents charted a PRN opioid, 4.7% received a PRN opioid on two or more occasions in the previous 7 days. In contrast, previous Australian studies have reported that opioids were among the most administered PRN medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Picton et al. reported that of 118 residents prescribed a PRN opioid at the index date, 76.0% were administered an opioid on one or more occasions over 12&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This discrepancy is likely due to the short lookback period of 7 days in our study. In Australia, GPs visit residential aged care services periodically and PRN medications ensure staff have timely access to manage resident symptoms, such as breakthrough pain. Sharma et al. reported opioid administrations were more common among residents in non-metropolitan areas, where GP presence is often limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our study, 3 of 12 services were located in regional areas. The exclusion of individuals with &lt;&#8201;3 months to live in our study is an important consideration, given that PRN administrations are more frequent at the end-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Females were more likely to be identified for analgesic review compared with males. Females report pain more frequently, receive more analgesics and are more susceptible to opioid-related ADEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Residents with prior fracture in their medical records were more likely to be identified, which highlights the importance of medication review post-hospitalization and potential deprescribing of analgesics post-resolution of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, observed pain meant residents were less likely to be identified compared with residents with no observed pain. Prevalence of mild/moderate observed pain was low (14.5%) in our study compared with previous research. A systematic review of five studies reported observed pain ranged from 19.1 to 43.2% in residents with dementia, and 27.1&#8211;67.0% in residents without dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This may have been because pain management strategies were effective in reducing pain for residents included in our study. The aged care provider organization had a structured approach to identifying and managing pain for all residents when our study was conducted.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Future Directions</title><p id="Par35">Analgesic indicators can be used to identify residents who may benefit from an individualized assessment of their analgesic regimen. Components of analgesic reviews and stewardship interventions include multidisciplinary medication reviews, systematic and thorough assessment of pain, and/or introduction of non-pharmacological approaches to pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Given these interventions can be resource and time intensive, indicators implemented at the system-level could be used to target analgesic stewardship interventions at the resident level.</p><p id="Par36">Among other benefits, advances in electronic medication management systems may represent unique opportunities to efficiently implement analgesic indicators and reform analgesic optimization in residential aged care services. Given the complexity of pain, the AMDA emphasizes the importance of adopting an interprofessional approach to pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interventions involving enhanced roles for nurses and pharmacists within the interprofessional team can improve analgesic use and appropriateness in residential aged care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Following recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Australian Government has committed AUS$345.7 million (US$239.5 million) over 4 years for aged care provider organizations to employ embedded on-site pharmacists starting in 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Analgesic reviews could be a key role undertaken by these pharmacists in partnership with the interprofessional team. Analgesic reviews may assist in reducing polypharmacy, because an increase in the use of analgesic medications has been identified as one of the top five factors contributing to the increasing prevalence of polypharmacy in Australian residential aged care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Embedded on-site pharmacists may complement or replace the pre-existing model for residential medication management reviews (RMMRs).</p><p id="Par37">In total, only 1 in 13 residents were identified for review based on opioid-related indicators. Application of opioid-related indicators provides a possible mechanism for aged care provider organizations to monitor safe and effective opioid use. Australian aged care provider organizations operate medication advisory committees (MACs) that oversee and monitor high-risk medication use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It is possible that further residents may have been identified for review if other analgesic indicators were applied. Other potential indicators include the proportion of opioid users administered laxatives, the concurrent use of opioids with other CNS depressants, and the proportion of opioid users experiencing pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Although not a focus of this study, frequent pain assessment helps to address potential underprescribing of opioids associated with resident and prescriber reluctance, hence improving uncontrolled pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Chronic opioid use, defined as continuous opioid use for at least 90 days or for 120 non-consecutive days, has been identified as a potential future quality indicator for addition to Australia&#8217;s National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further research is needed to explore the predictive validity of analgesic indicators at identifying residents most susceptible to analgesic-related ADEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par38">We analysed data for a well-characterized sample of residents. The AMDA Pain Management Guideline recommends an analgesic review for residents receiving opioids without a clearly documented clinical rationale (i.e., indicator 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, not all potentially painful conditions should be managed with opioids. For example, we included arthritis as a potentially painful condition, yet the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) do not recommend opioids for managing osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Additionally, some conditions may cause pain and were not considered as one of the prespecified potentially painful conditions (e.g., people living with diabetes). Nursing progress notes were not accessed for this study but may have contained information related to each resident&#8217;s current pain status and pain management strategy. Although comprehensive pain assessments were undertaken by trained study nurses using a scale for which inter-rater reliability has been demonstrated, we did not compute inter-rater reliability of pain assessments undertaken by the nurses in our study. The prevalence of pain and pain intensity can vary according to the pain assessment method used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Future studies may analyse both self-reported and observed pain scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It was not possible to determine whether pain management practices have changed following publication of the guideline or with increased awareness regarding acetaminophen dose, as the data were collected 2 years prior to publication of the AMDA Pain Management Guideline. The study was conducted in partnership with a single aged care provider organization in South Australia, meaning the generalizability to the wider aged care population is unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">Up to one in three residents may benefit from a review of their analgesic regimen, including 1 in 13 who may benefit from a specific review of their opioid regimen. Analgesic indicators represent a new approach to target analgesic stewardship interventions in residential aged care services. Analgesic indicators may also assist aged care provider organizations to monitor safe and effective opioid use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="40266_2023_1025_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 113 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Terry Short for supporting the study coordination and contributing to the study design, as well as Hilary Ashby who supported the study coordination.
