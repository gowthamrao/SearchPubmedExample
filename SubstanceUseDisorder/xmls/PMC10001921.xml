Introduction</title><p>South African University or campus communities are reported to be mainly heterosexual, which encourages a lot of prejudice towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) students, according to Brink [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Gnan [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The heteronormative environment in the institutions of higher learning was not only reported in South Africa but also in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as highlighted by Nduna, et al. [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The previous research on South African universities by Bhana [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], McLachlan [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Sithole [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and Copp, et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that students who belong to the LGBTQI community experience numerous challenges on campuses. These include verbal harassment, physical attacks, cyberbullying, social isolation, rejection, increasing feelings of insecurity and experiences of victimisation, and theft or damage to their personal property by other students, as reported by Gonzalez, et al. [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Shramko, et al. [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and Semlyen, et al. [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Nyeck et al. [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicated that the heteronormative environment in South Africa may be due to a view that same-sex relationships are &#8220;not African&#8221; but rather are seen as a Western creation. Similarly, in Taiwan, they contended that homosexuality is unnatural and deviant and that legalizing same-sex partnerships will promote homosexuality in society, create major epidemics of HIV infections, and depopulate the country, as reported by Lin et al. [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is also evidence that South African society thinks homosexuality is a condition that can be &#8220;treated&#8221; or &#8220;fixed&#8221;, as highlighted by De Ru [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Mashabane [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One explanation, according to De Ru [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], could be that part of South African society&#8217;s fundamental ideas, which shape its social standards and values, are drawn from the Christian church. Even though South Africa&#8217;s legal system is among the most progressive in the world, particularly when it comes to the rights of sexual minorities, local research shows that social attitudes and norms are not always in line with the country&#8217;s progressive legislation (Kleinhans [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; Nyeck et al. [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Instead, many South Africans continue to support monogamy and heterosexuality ideas. Additionally, Leburu et al. [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] claimed that similar concepts and attitudes permeate tertiary educational institutions, putting homosexual students in danger of discrimination or being subjected to violence. Therefore, LGBTQI students are more likely to experience mental health problems due to the difficulties encountered at tertiary institutions than their heterosexual colleagues, according to Gnan [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual individuals are referred to by the acronyms LGB, LGBT+, LGBTQ, LGBTQI, and LGBTQIA+. The abbreviations LGB and LGBTQI will be used in this article. The term LGB will refer to the participants, while LGBTQI refers to all individuals of this minority group in this article.</p><sec id="sec1dot1-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.1. Current Incidents of Homophobic Attacks in South African Schools</title><p>Naude [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Zagagana [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] described South African schools as a hostile environment to LGBTQI and gender nonconforming students for too long, citing the following incidents as published by Roxburgh [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] from the <italic toggle="yes">Mail &amp; Guardian</italic> news: the Soweto boy committed suicide on August 2022, claiming that a student teacher had humiliated him because of his sexuality; a 14-year-old student in the Eastern Cape also killed himself in August after being ridiculed at school. Similarly, another teen committed suicide in June 2022 as a result of ongoing bullying at school. Other incidents that took place in 2020 include a 16-year-old who was stabbed 13 times and killed in Khayelitsha because of his sexual orientation; a teacher in Robertson was attacked by parents because of his sexual orientation; and a visiting pastor in Cape Town warned students that, homosexual people are going to hell, as stated by Naude [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] from the African News Agency.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.2. Brief Overview of the University Experiences Amongst South African LGBTQI Students</title><p>Higher education institutions are concerned about the creation of institutions free from prejudice, as reported by Munyuki et al. [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, Jones [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Nduna et al. [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that stigmatisation and discrimination of homosexual people at higher education institutions continue to be a challenge.</p><p>A study on the experiences of lesbian students by Leonard [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] revealed that the participants reported encountering homophobic behaviour experiences including psychological trauma, exclusion from social situations, and verbal, physical, and/or sexual abuse. However, other researchers believed that homophobic practices in South African institutions of higher learning are influenced by African cultural interpretations and selective readings of religious texts (Nduna et al. [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).</p><p>Another study conducted with university students by Sithole [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found that the LBTQI group of students are labelled as &#8220;sissyboys&#8221;, &#8220;Isitabane&#8221;, or &#8220;trassis&#8221;, which are terms for homosexuality in South Africa. Overall, 67% of the participants reported feeling excluded from class discussions by the lecturers and other students, whereas 58% of participants thought they received unfair treatment at the campus medical facility. Healthcare providers on-campus support discrimination by refusing to treat students. Discrimination was also noticed at the residence.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.3. Brief Overview of Measures to Combat Homophobic Practices in South African Institutions of Higher Learning</title><p>Renn [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] revealed evidence that universities are creating conditions where LGBT students can succeed academically, socially, and personally. Munyuki et al. [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] highlighted that South African universities have put in place a range of formal policies that express their commitment to creating an environment for students that is free of discrimination, and many of these policies explicitly mention sexual orientation. Different programmes focusing on the LGBTI community on campuses are conducted. These include creating Gender Equity Units, planning Gay Pride marches, symposiums, campaigns, and closing functions at the end of the year as well as establishing support groups and supporting the annual International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) (Brink [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Zagagana [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; Makapela [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; Sefali [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]).</p><p>In addition, the provincial Department of Education (WCED) drafted the country&#8217;s first Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Guidelines according to Naude [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Western Cape Department of Education&#8217;s proposed guidelines is a crucial first step in creating a school atmosphere that is tolerant of gender and sexual diversity. The guidelines aim to sensitise public schools and the education environment to LGBTQI rights, in the promotion of a more inclusive approach and progressive realisation of Constitutional rights.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot4-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.4. Impact of Continuous Exposure to Homophobic and Transphobic Attacks on University Students</title><p>The general mental and social well-being of LGBTI students are negatively impacted by their constant exposure to homophobic and transphobic attacks (Jones [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Some turn to suicide, while others experience emotional distress and alcohol and drug abuse (Moagi, et al. [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Renn [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; Gnan [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Their academic performance suffers, and the ongoing stigma increases the number of students who drop out of school (Kosciw et al. [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; Sukamti et al. [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). According to the Mental Health Foundation (2021) in the UK, this particular group is more likely than heterosexual students to have poor mental health.</p><p>Yet, there is very little empirical research in the nursing science literature on issues related to the discrimination and stigmatisation of LGBTQI students at higher education institutions, as well as the impact on their mental health. There is virtually no attention on issues related to LGBTIQ students in nursing education. In addition, no study of this type has ever been undertaken in South Africa. Thus, the researchers decided to conduct this study in a nursing department at a university. This study is designed to address this gap and identify some key issues for improving the mental well-being of these particular students on campus.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot5-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.5. Theoretical Framework</title><p>Erving Goffman&#8217;s [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] theories of stigma and labelling, as well as Link and Phelan&#8217;s [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] conceptualization of stigma, guided this study. The stigma theories were used to investigate the types of stigmas experienced by LGBTQI students at a university, as well as the effects of the stigma on their mental health and how they deal with their mental health challenges. Furthermore, the theories influenced how the findings were interpreted. Erving Goffman [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] defined stigma as an &#8220;attribute that is deeply discrediting&#8221;. A discredited attribute could be obvious, such as race, nation, or religion, or it could be hidden but still discreditable if revealed, such as sex workers, homosexuality, or a criminal record. Goffman [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] described stigmatised people as those who do not have full social acceptance and constantly strive to adjust their social identities.</p><p>Stigmatisation is reported to often go hand-in-hand with labels of deviance according to Goffman&#8217;s [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] theory of labelling. Goffman [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] defines labelling as a process of how labels are constructed and applied to certain individuals or groups to curtail or denigrate their actions. Stigma is about applying a label to describe someone&#8217;s perceived (or otherwise) non-conformist, degenerate, or simply different behaviour.</p><p>Link and Phelan [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] highlighted that once a person is labelled, there is very little that person can do to shake off this label. Clair [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a social psychologist, noted that stigmatisation has been linked to several negative outcomes, including harm to one&#8217;s self-worth, academic performance, mental health, and physical well-being. Stigmatised individuals reported managing their stigmatised identities and coping with specific instances of discrimination by adopting numerous coping responses to stress such as avoidance, suppression, and identity development (Drapalski [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; Patel &amp; Hanlon [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot6-ijerph-20-04420"><title>1.6. Research Aim</title><p>The researchers considered that performing this study on LGBTQI students was critical because the South African community is predominantly heterosexual, which fosters prejudice against LGBTQI students. The researchers believed that the problems associated with discrimination could hurt the mental health, academic performance, and success of students. Regardless of societal discrimination and stigma based on sexual orientation, a student must be emotionally stable to observe, think critically, and make appropriate decisions both in and out of the classroom. Therefore, the results could then be used to help guide intervention efforts on the part of the University when seeking to create a more welcoming environment for LGBTQI students. This study, therefore, explored and described the challenges experienced by LGBTQI students that might affect their mental well-being and the kinds of coping behaviour adopted when dealing with those challenges.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-20-04420"><title>2. Research Design and Method</title><p>A descriptive phenomenological approach was adopted for this study. Employing this approach, the researchers were able to explore and describe the rich, in-depth lived experiences and coping behaviour of the selected students. The students were encouraged to link their day-to-day experiences to the challenges that might affect their mental health and well-being and different kinds of coping behaviour. Using this design, the researchers were able to describe the meaning of LGBTQI students&#8217; actions and behaviours.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-ijerph-20-04420"><title>2.1. Research Setting</title><p>This study was conducted at the School of Health Care Sciences, Nursing Science Department in one of the selected institutions of higher learning in Limpopo Province, South Africa. At the time of this study, the Nursing Science Department offered undergraduate, post-basic, and postgraduate courses which include a four-year undergraduate bachelor&#8217;s degree in Nursing Science (R425), a one-year postgraduate diploma in Clinical Nursing Health Assessment, Treatment and Care (R48), and master&#8217;s and doctoral degrees. The setting was selected because LGBTQI undergraduate students were becoming more visible throughout the campus and exploring their mental health issues would help to raise awareness of their mental health problems and how this minority group could be accommodated and supported.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijerph-20-04420"><title>2.2. Population of Interest and Sampling Strategy</title><p>The first two participants were known to the researcher as LGBTQI, and they self-disclose their sexual identity. Thereafter, the other participants were identified using a snowballing sampling technique. Snowball sampling is a technique for locating people who would otherwise be difficult or impossible to locate according to Creswell [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The first two participants referred the researcher to seven participants who self-identify as LGBTQI. Of the seven, two declined to participate in the study. The researchers were referred to an additional three participants.</p><p>Although the sample size seems to be small, snowball sampling was used because the sample size was not easily identified in an institution of higher learning similar to where this study was conducted. The rural context and culture and stigma define how this population live. The sample size in phenomenological inquiry is relatively small because the aim is to acquire information that is useful for understanding the complexity or context surrounding the phenomenon. Methodologists such as Creswell [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] recommend a sample size of 3&#8211;10 participants for a phenomenological inquiry.</p><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-ijerph-20-04420"><title>2.2.1.

[<xref rid="B1-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The researchers reviewed the transcripts while listening to the recordings and rectified any spelling or other problems in the transcripts. The authors independently coded the data by going over participant responses. Based on related concepts or meanings, all of the responses were sorted and put together. Following the analysis of participant responses, words or sentences were coded and grouped. These groupings created the initial themes. Then, the authors met to decide on the initial themes. An auditor reviewed the preliminary themes and gave the authors feedback. After carefully going over the data and coding quotes in accordance with the themes, the authors modified the thematic structure and constructed themes for the dataset. A consensus meeting was set up between the researchers to address any differences in opinion that cropped up during the coding process, to update the initial themes, to find new topics, and to eliminate themes until the final themes and subthemes were produced. Thus, themes that directly pertained to and answered the research question were identified. These themes are presented in the results set out below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijerph-20-04420"><title>2.5.

Permission to undertake the study was obtained from the Director of the Health Care Sciences School as well as the Head of the Nursing Science Department. Individual participants in this study gave their informed consent. Participants were given complete information about this study, including the objective, risks, and benefits, what was expected of them, and that confidentiality would be maintained so that they could give informed permission. They were also informed about the data collection tool. Confidentiality was ensured because each participant was given a code name, and these codes were used when discussing data, as recommended by Creswell [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The participants were not required to identify themselves by name during the recording. The name of the institution at which this study was conducted is also not mentioned in this report. Furthermore, the information that had been obtained was kept in a secure location to which only the researchers had access. The information was kept under lock and key and only the researchers had access to the key.

They were freely expressing their challenges, and at times, their eyes filled with tears revealing their feelings of helplessness and hopelessness when they described the emotions that they experienced relating to the circumstances affecting their mental health. These circumstances included bullying, teasing, and verbal abuse. However, when they described their coping mechanisms, they smiled and laughed to show that they had eventually developed a tolerance for internal and external distress. They seemed cautious about sharing their experiences, as shown by the fact that they were a bit reticent when talking about their sexual identity.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijerph-20-04420"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>This research explored and described the challenges experienced by LGB students and their mental well-being as well as the coping behaviours adopted in a university in South Africa. The study found that LGB students perceived character defects stigma from fellow students and lecturers in and out of class. These include victimisation, bullying, labelling as &#8220;stabane&#8221;, funny looks, threats, insults, and teasing to belittle them on university premises (such as public spaces, bathrooms, and classrooms), which were based on their character. The findings are in line with Letsoalo [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Sava, et al. [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Antebi-Gruszka, et al. [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and Treharne et al. [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which reported similar findings.</p><p>The character defects stigma subjected to LGB students negatively affected their mental health. Therefore, the mental health challenges experienced included a diminished sense of safety and feeling of being unaccepted and unliked by others, resulting in a lack of the sense of belonging. Participants also reported low self-esteem, which is manifested by difficulties in choosing, joining, and participating in a discussion group because of a fear of how the other members would react. Acting out behaviour was also found to be a mental health challenge, whereby some participants were seen crying or screaming in class, and others reported to be drinking too much alcohol, which might predispose them to some mental health conditions such as alcohol dependency or substance-induced psychosis. A study conducted by Dau et al. [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] showed that over 25% of LGBTQI people at a university in Australia experience alcoholism, and there is a strong correlation between victimisation and alcohol usage. Another study conducted in Lesotho by Fantus et al. [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that alcohol usage is a stigma-coping method as well as a way to create LGBTQI friendships.</p><p>Participants reported managing their stigmatised identities and coping with specific instances of discrimination by adopting numerous coping behaviours. First among these is passive withdrawal behaviour (disengagement by bunking classes, refraining from using the residence bathrooms, and staying off campus). Passive withdrawal behaviour was described as an unhealthy coping mechanism by Gnan [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which has a negative influence on the mental health of this population. The second is active dependent behaviour (self-acceptance, concentrating more on schoolwork, and support systems such as friends, lecturers, and support groups) and confrontation. These kinds of behaviour were reported to be associated with better psychosocial adjustment and a greater likelihood that participants would attain their degrees by Goldbach, et al. [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Toomey, et al. [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The last strategy was tolerance, which involves changing the way they think about the experiences of LGBTQI stigma. Other suggested coping strategies that are required on campus include the gender-based unit, the gay pride march, and single rooms for students. Brink [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Zagagana [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-20-04420" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that to date, the majority of local and international institutions have a gender-based office and hold an annual gay pride march to create awareness and educate the university community about sexual orientation.</p><p>The findings of this study integrated with the theories of stigma since participants perceived character defects stigmatisation and labelling on campus. The stigmatised persons who are LGBTQI students exhibit a variety of negative outcomes such as low self-esteem, a loss of the sense of belonging, acting out behaviour, and an avoidant coping technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-ijerph-20-04420"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Given the fact that character defects stigmatisation was discovered to be the most significant challenge subjecting LGBTQI students to mental health challenges on campus, understanding the factors influencing heterogeneous students&#8217; and lecturers&#8217; behaviour among this group is a critical area of future research. The university should consider creating awareness about the rights of LGBTQI students to education, safety, and self-determination. Leaders of the LGBTQI support system could seek a time slot on the University&#8217;s radio station to discuss homosexuality-related issues and concerns. School health outreach should be organised by the Nursing Science Department to make high school learners aware of the effects of bullying and negative attitudes towards LGBTQI students. The university could develop a policy that protects the rights of this group of students and outlines the actions that would be taken if those rights are violated. Creating a consistent, &#8216;high-touch&#8217; environment marked by safety, security, and regular communication is essential. These aims can be accomplished by allocating a residence to this gender minority group, allowing them the freedom to use the restrooms without worrying about being bullied. Fostering trusting relationships between learners, teachers, staff, and other individuals in programmes is also important. Organising a Gay pride march for this particular community once a year at which they can all meet and enjoy themselves without being interrupted by other students is a positive step. All LGBTQI students should be encouraged to use the student counselling centre to deal with the social and emotional issues that they face on campus.</p><p>The policymakers in South Africa should consider the drafted country&#8217;s first Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Policy Guidelines, as it addresses most of the interventions for the challenges experienced by LGBTQI students, which include allowing for unisex bathroom facilities, consideration for sleeping arrangements, and recommendations for safe spaces and social diversity associations at schools.</p><sec><title>Strength and Limitations</title><p>Theories of stigma were used to guide the process of this study and to make research findings meaningful. The study adopted a descriptive phenomenological design to obtain complete and accurate information by allowing LGBTQI students to describe their day-to-day experiences that affect their mental health and coping behaviour. A limited number of participants was utilised, which limits the generalisability of the findings.
