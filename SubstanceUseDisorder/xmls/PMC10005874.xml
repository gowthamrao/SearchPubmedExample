Introduction</title><p>Worldwide, tobacco use is responsible for the most preventable deaths with more than 8 million deaths annually, of which many are avoidable [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over 7 million of these tobacco-related deaths are associated with direct use while 1.2 million are associated with second-hand smoke exposure [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been noted that smoking and inactivity rank among the three most adaptable risk factors for chronic disease and premature death, and it is predicted that current smokers die approximately 10 years earlier than age-matched nonsmokers [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Smoking is also accountable for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial damage annually, which may subsequently be avoided if smoking incidence and magnitude were reduced [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2003, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) was developed in response to the global tobacco epidemic with the goal to improve public health [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Currently, most hospitals do not allow patients to smoke on facility grounds, and therefore, as Reid et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have noted, hospitalisation provides an excellent opportunity for the health service to identify, actively involve and engage smokers, and initiate the provision of smoking cessation treatments, support, and follow-up. Furthermore, encouragement from a health professional in the inpatient setting is a significant external prompt for a smoker to attempt quitting. Health [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] indicated that one in every 33 approaches leads to success in smoking cessation.</p><p>An evaluation by Reid et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found that combination of SCIs such as inpatient-initiated counselling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with postdischarge follow-up has demonstrated significantly higher smoking cessation rates. Furthermore, the Cochrane systematic review (SR) on ISCIs by Rigotti et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found them to be effective, regardless of the patient's admitting diagnosis, or whether the admission was to an acute or rehabilitation facility. This supports the use of ISCIs as effective interventions for smoking cessation.</p><p>In the United States, The Joint Commission [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] developed evidence-based guidelines for all hospitalised inpatients which mandate that following identification of all tobacco smokers, they are offered and/or provided with evidence-based support (counselling and medication) during their admission and on discharge from hospital, and this smoking status reassessed following discharge. Smoking cessation not only increases life expectancy, decreases the risk of associated chronic diseases [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and reduces healthcare costs; thus, ongoing investment in evidence-based interventions to assist with smoking cessation is crucial to addressing these ongoing issues. Indeed, the relatively low cost of inpatient smoking cessation interventions (ISCIs) has been shown to be cost-effective compared to the healthcare costs associated with ongoing smoking [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Background</title><p>Although a SR on SCIs by Rigotti et.al [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for hospitalised patients identified their effectiveness, the SR was limited to the inclusion of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs. Moreover, the funding mechanism of the facility and ISCI was not explicit and did not include any qualitative data reflecting participants' perspectives on the ISCIs, and the SR has yet to be updated. Ugalde et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] conducted a SR on ISCI implementation strategies and their success evaluating outcomes. The authors highlighted the need for qualitative data to provide depth and understanding of the clinical and patient experience. In addition, Sharpe et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] conducted their SR on barriers to the provision of ISCIs from clinicians' perspectives and, however, did not include patient perspectives or a broader range of staff perspectives. Therefore, in order to complement and build on the work of Rigotti et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Sharpe et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Ugalde et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], this qualitative integrative review (IR) of the literature focusing on staff and participants' perspectives of ISCIs will provide the reader with a broader understanding of potential contributing factors to the success or failure of ISCIs and therefore further insight in to the processes that lead to the outcome of this kind of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. The Review</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Aim</title><p>The aim of this qualitative IR was to identify, integrate, and appraise the evidence on hospitalised smokers' and staff perspectives of ISCIs and impact on smokers' quality of life (QOL) and to explore stakeholder and participant views on inpatient smoking cessation programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Design</title><p>The IR design was selected to include qualitative data as the methods involved in SRs and meta-analyses place a greater emphasis on the quality of RCTs and levels of evidence. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The IR methodology produces a greater understanding of the breadth and depth of the phenomenon through the inclusion of nonexperimental and experimental research [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It also consider questions that remain unanswered by building on previous work in the area [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The previous SRs conducted on this topic [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] focused on effectiveness outcomes, implementation strategies, and some limited staff perspectives on delivering ISCIs. Therefore, through the inclusion of a wider range of staff and patient perspectives and impact on QOL for patients, this qualitative IR will provide the reader with a broader understanding of potential contributing factors to the failure/success of ISCIs by providing further insight into the processes leading to the outcome of an intervention [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the insights into the feasibility of translating an ISCI to other settings such as the private sector and funding limitations/preferences are also identified.</p><p>The methodology used for this qualitative IR was based on those described by Whittemore and Knafl [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as the framework provided address issues such as data analysis that are specific to IRs.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3.

A number of facilitators and barriers to ISCIs consisted of creating a supportive patient-centred environment and considering cost of NRT and time to deliver ISCIs.

[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Overall, the evaluations and attitudes towards ISCIs were positive, and no negative comments were reported.</p><p>Patients involved in ISCIs reported that hospitalisation was an appropriately timed opportunity [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and a positive experience [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and were satisfied with the service received [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finkelstein and Cha [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] assessed the feasibility of using of a mobile app for their ISCI.

In addition, the staff found that they had increased confidence in their ability to deliver smoking cessation services [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and believed that the intervention provided an important service that was helpful for patients [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2.

Despite all four studies only consisting of 1&#8211;1.5 hours of training for staff, provision of services increased by 10&#8211;29% following the training period, demonstrating that even a short period of training increased the chance of a patient receiving an ISCI.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. Facilitators and Barriers to ISCPs</title><p>Facilitators to ISCIs were discussed by one study [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] from a nursing perspective. The authors suggested that to ensure effective ISCIs and a positive outcome, the following was essential: a patient-centred and supportive environment, encouragement of lifestyle modification, appropriately timed counselling, and onward referral as required. This involved building teams to support the patient, as per Li et al. [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (p4788), who reported that when health professionals worked together to emphasise the advantages of smoking cessation, &#8220;they are more effective at promoting smoking cessation counselling and motivating patients to quit smoking.&#8221;</p><p>Barriers to ISCPs were discussed in five of the studies [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Patient-related barriers included the cost of pharmacotherapy had it not been provided as part of an ISCI [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], fear of becoming tense, experiencing mood swings, gaining weight, failing to stop smoking [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and overall lack of interest or resistance from patients.

Recommendations from patients included longer follow-up periods and improved access to smoking cessation medications [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Recommendations from staff perspectives consisted of the appointment of a program coordinator or champion [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], ensuring resources are readily available, scheduling specific times for counselling sessions, having simple to use documentation templates for guiding the delivery of ISCIs [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and ongoing promotion and training for staff including the demonstration of effectiveness of the program [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Patient preferences for ISCIs were provided by three studies [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Dobrinas et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported on initial assessment that only 15% of their program participants were interested in receiving NRT; however, no other preferences were assessed. Interestingly, following only one to two hospital visits, one month following discharge, 20% of participants were using NRT and readiness to quit improved in 53% of patients. Thomas et al. [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported medication (49.5%), followed by &#8220;cold turkey&#8221; (33.5%), and gradual reduction (13.3%) as preferred strategies for smoking cessation. Within the medication preferences, NRT patches were the most popular (54.2%), then tablets (45%), inhalers (40.8%), lozenges (34.7%), e-cigarettes (32.3%), gum (27%), and sublingual tablets (23%). This is further supported by York et al. [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] who identified that not only was the use of an NRT patch considered a preferred cessation aid but also most patients were willing to pay for NRT patches on discharge as an ongoing cessation aid.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>4.5. QOL Changes</title><p>Impact on QOL was assessed in two mixed method studies using survey-based methods [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Politis et al. [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found statistically significant improvements in SF-36 scores in both groups who participated in an ISCI. Schoberberger et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported statistically significant improvements in lifestyle satisfaction using the standardised German Fragebogen zur Erfassung des Gesundheitsverhaltens (FEG) questionnaire for ex-smokers versus continuing smokers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Discussion</title><p>The findings from this review complement the previous work in this area by Rigotti et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Sharpe et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Ugalde et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], by qualitatively presenting participants' perspectives on ISCIs including the impact on QOL for patients.</p><p>Although Rigotti et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] identified that ISCIs are effective, no qualitative data or participants' perspectives were included within the review. This present qualitative IR identified that both patients' and staff experiences of ISCIs were positive experiences and an important and useful starting point to smoking cessation and therefore support the findings by Rigotti et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The SR conducted by Sharpe et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on barriers to the provision of ISCIs from clinicians' perspectives was limited as they did not include patient perspectives or a broader range of staff perspectives. Although the barriers presented in this review were similar to those highlighted by Sharpe et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], additional perspectives from both patients and staff included clinician recommendations for future ISCIs and patient preferences for ISCIs and impact on QOL.</p><p>Ugalde et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in their SR on ISCI implementation strategies and evaluation of their success, identified that brief intervention strategies alone are insufficient for long-term success with rates of delivery of ISCIs. This is reflected in the findings from this IR, which identified that staff recommended the appointment of a ISCI program coordinator or champion [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to provide ongoing support for staff. However, despite these recommendations, the findings from this qualitative IR identified that following 1-1.5 hours of staff training, delivery of ISCIs improved at two months [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and up to 15 months [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] posttraining. Therefore, despite the findings from Ugalde et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], this qualitative IR indicates that brief training is still effective for those organisations investing in the delivery of ISCIs.</p><p>A more recent study [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] on hospital staff perspectives on the provision on inpatient smoking cessation services concurred with findings from this IR that time constraints and lack of knowledge and resources are barriers to the delivery of these services. Russell et al. [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] also identified that staff believe that all members who are part of the hospital workforce should be involved in ISCIs in order to ensure the consistent delivery of the smoking cessation message. Additional barriers identified included patient groups (e.g., mental health) and context (e.g., emergency department not deemed an appropriate location to address smoking cessation).</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this qualitative IR. Firstly, the review was limited to publications from the last 10 years, English language only publications, and studies published in peer-reviewed journals. This may have reduced the number of eligible studies in this review. Timing and funding to expand the inclusion criteria may have produced more data. Another limitation of this IR involved the appraisal of literature by two reviewers and their sensitivity analyses which lead to the exclusion of three studies. However, the use of two reviewers who independently appraised each study strengthened this IR.</p><p>Overall, this qualitative IR has added a further depth of knowledge and understanding as to why ISCIs are effective by providing an insight to patient and staff perspectives on ISCIs. However, only two studies [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] assessed the impact of QOL of ISCIs, and although both demonstrated statistically significant improvements, further research in this area using additional QOL outcome measures and interviews would be beneficial to add to the qualitative findings.</p><p>Potential solutions for the successful delivery of ISCIs may include ensuring all health professionals are well supported and educated to provide this service to patients by allocating sufficient time and funding for both training (initial and refresher sessions) and delivery of the service as discussed by Reid et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most ISCIs are facilitated by nursing and medical staff. By focusing on a multidisciplinary approach and involving other health professionals, other than nursing and medical staff, this may reduce the staff burden and ensure the consistent delivery of the smoking cessation message. If clinicians are enthusiastic and knowledgeable and have the time to discuss the importance of smoking cessation and explore strategies to deal with cravings, this may lead to better acceptance by patients and staff.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusion</title><p>This qualitative IR provides further insight into both clinician and patient participants' perspectives on ISCIs. Overall, they are considered to have positive benefits, and staff training appears to be an effective means for service delivery. However, insufficient time and lack of resources or expertise appear to be consistent barriers to the delivery of these services, so they should be considered when planning the implementation of an ISCI.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Points</title><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Key Point Summary</italic>. (i) Tobacco use is responsible for most preventable deaths worldwide, with more than 8 million deaths annually attributed to tobacco use; smoking kills half of its consumers, of which many are avoidable [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. (ii) &#8220;Hospitalisation provides a unique opportunity to identify and engage smokers, initiate cessation treatments and facilitate appropriate follow-up and support&#8221; as most hospitals do not allow patients to smoke on their grounds [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (p11). (iii) Encouragement from a health professional is a significant external prompt for a smoker to attempt quitting [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. (iv) Previous systematic reviews conducted on this topic [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have focused on effectiveness outcomes, implementation strategies and outcomes, and some staff perspectives on delivering inpatient smoking cessation interventions. (v) To date, a qualitative review that is inclusive of all participants' perspectives on inpatient smoking cessation interventions has not been conducted. Therefore, the purpose of this integrative review is to synthesise and present qualitative research findings from the last 10 years regarding staff and patients' perspectives on participating in an inpatient smoking cessation intervention, including the impact on quality of life for patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>No conflicts of interest have been declared by the authors.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Leah Epton was the primary author overseeing study conception and design and the draft manuscript preparation.
