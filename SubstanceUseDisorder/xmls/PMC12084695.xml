<xref rid="bibr10-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> Older persons are particularly susceptible to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to altered pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and changes in organ function (e.g., increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier or reduced renal and liver functions).<sup><xref rid="bibr10-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This is further complicated by multimorbidity often present in older age, which in turn can lead to polypharmacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Geriatric patients are also often prescribed potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which bear an unfavorable benefit-to-risk ratio and further increase the risk of ADRs.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Other previous studies have shown that the use of benzodiazepines is frequent in geriatric PEs.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Use of this drug class increases the risk of falls or cognitive impairment in geriatric patients instead.<sup>

Medication lists of geriatric patients treated in the psychiatric ED, who were administered medication in the ED, served as the basis. DDIs before and after drug prescriptions in the ED were evaluated. Furthermore, frequency and characteristics of PIM prescriptions were studied based on the most commonly used PIM classification systems in Germany, the PRISCUS list 2.0 (priscus (Latin), ancient, venerable) and the Fit fOR The Aged (FORTA) classification.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section8-20451253251339373"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section9-20451253251339373"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (No. 10767_BO_K_2023) and adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its later amendments (current version from 2024).</p></sec><sec id="section10-20451253251339373"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients were enrolled in the study (i) if they were &#10878;65&#8201;years of age, (ii) if they were treated in the psychiatric ED of Hannover Medical School between January 2018 and December 2022, (iii) if they were administered psychotropic drugs during treatment in the ED, and (iv) if they or their legal representative had provided written informed consent that patient-related data be used for clinical research. Patients received treatment in the ED for a psychiatric condition. Hannover Medical School is a large university hospital and tertiary care referral center in northern Germany. During the length of the study, 12,854 patient cases were treated in the psychiatric ED, 1783 of which referred to individuals aged &#10878;65&#8201;years. There were no specific exclusion criteria. Psychiatric patients are treated in an interdisciplinary emergency department and, if inpatient treatment is indicated, they are transferred to a geriatric psychiatry ward for further treatment as soon as possible. Psychotropic drugs refer to drugs that affect brain function and are used to treat psychiatric and neurological disorders. These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers, targeting conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.</p><p>The reporting of this study conforms to the STROBE statement (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20451253251339373" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material</ext-link>).<sup>

</sup> This resulted in a more detailed categorization of individual drug classes, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antipsychotics. Within our study, newly prescribed drugs were classified as PIMs (according to the PRISCUS 2.0 list), non-PIMs (i.e., drugs not listed as PIMs in the PRISCUS 2.0 list), and suitable therapeutic alternatives to PIMs (according to the PRISCUS 2.0 list) by the expert panel described above. The classification of some drugs as PIMs or therapeutic alternatives is partly based on the prescription period and dosage. Therefore, certain prescriptions (e.g., pipamperone or risperidone) were only classified as PIMs if they were prescribed as long-term medication after administration in the ED.</p><p>The FORTA classification was validated for the first time in 2014 and applies to people aged &#10878;65&#8201;years and is explicitly tailored to the German pharmaceutical market.<sup>

The composition of our study population was very similar in terms of age, gender, and somatic comorbidities to those in studies that also referred to geriatric psychiatric patient groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The present study has shown that in geriatric PEs, only 18.1% of all prescriptions were classified as a therapeutic alternative according to the PRISCUS 2.0 list. So, the proportion of PIM prescriptions based on the PRISCUS 2.0 list is significantly higher than previously reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, comparability between these studies is difficult for various reasons. First, the results of our work relate to the treatment of PEs in the ED setting, whereas other studies were based on routine data from the treatment of outpatients and inpatients. Furthermore, the use of some drug classes classified as PIM, such as benzodiazepines or certain antipsychotics such as haloperidol, is often unavoidable in PEs due to a lack of alternatives, which is now also included as a discussion point in the PRISCUS 2.0 list.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> In addition, PIM prevalences of preliminary studies generally referred to the first version of the PRISCUS list, while the updated version from 2023 was used as the basis for our work. This version now includes recommendations for 177 drugs and is significantly more restrictive than the first version, which only included information on 83 drugs. In line with this, a recent study examining prescribing in geriatric inpatients based on the PRISCUS 2.0 list found that 77.1% of all patients received at least one PIM prescription.<sup>

</sup></p><p>In the present study, most newly prescribed drugs were classified as FORTA C (70.2%) and FORTA D (22.3%), indicating an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for a substantial proportion of prescriptions. Almost all patients in the study population received at least one PIM prescription according to the FORTA classification. One possible explanation for this high prevalence is that the FORTA classification, with recommendations for 299 drugs, is more extensive than the PRISCUS 2.0 list. Of note, neither the PRISCUS 2.0 list nor the FORTA classification is specifically tailored to geriatric psychiatric patients, and the benefit-risk ratio is rarely taken into account for psychiatric emergencies.</p><p>In contrast to the PRISCUS list, there are fewer studies reporting PIM prevalence based on the FORTA classification. A multicenter observational study by Kr&#252;ger et al.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr27-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> found a significantly higher prevalence of PIM prescriptions among geriatric patients in Germany according to the FORTA classification compared to the PRISCUS list. The prevalence of PIM prescriptions according to the FORTA classification was recorded as 44.3% in another study focusing on a geriatric patient collective, whereas Schr&#246;der et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> reported a prevalence of 71.1% in geriatric patients with alcohol use disorder. These findings suggest that PIM prevalence according to the FORTA classification is consistently higher than in studies referring to the PRISCUS list.</p><p>The most frequently administered drugs listed as PIM according to the PRISCUS 2.0 list were lorazepam, oxazepam, and pipamperone. However, it should be noted that although pipamperone, which may be a therapeutic alternative to benzodiazepines in certain clinical scenarios, was categorized as a PIM when administered as a regular medication for a period of more than 6&#8201;weeks, its short-term use for the treatment of PEs was appropriate. According to the FORTA classification, lorazepam and pipamperone with label C and oxazepam and haloperidol with label D were the most frequently used PIMs. A study on prescribing behavior in geriatric patients in a German practice network also identified antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs as the most frequently used PIMs.<sup>

Although the delirogenic potential, increased risk of falls, and dependency potential of lorazepam and oxazepam must be considered, the use of these drugs appears to be more suitable than the use of long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam with its risk of cumulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-20451253251339373" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Available alternatives for the treatment of agitation or suicidality, such as low-potency antipsychotics like levomepromazine or chlorpromazine, also bear anticholinergic effects and the risk of extrapyramidal motor ADRs.<sup>

</sup> Our study found that the number of DDIs per patient was significantly higher when considering drugs administered in the ED than before treatment. The majority of additional DDIs were due to an interaction of risperidone with low-potency antipsychotics (melperone and pipamperone), with the risk of CNS depressant effects. At the same time, when combining risperidone with pipamperone or melperone, the QTc prolonging potential of all drugs involved has to be considered.<sup>

In addition, a large number of the initially screened potential study participants had to be excluded, as most of them were not administered medication in the ED and were younger than 65&#8201;years. Furthermore, the specialized setting of a university hospital cannot be directly extrapolated to peripheral psychiatric hospitals. The relatively small sample size also limits the generalizability of our findings. Finally, no systematic recording of ADRs took place.

PIM prevalence was significantly higher than in preliminary studies, which was due to the high rate of prescriptions for benzodiazepines and low-potency antipsychotics. Nevertheless, their use in the treatment of geriatric PEs is often unavoidable and generally appears beneficial. However, their long-term use as a regular medication should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, we call for a PIM classification specifically tailored to the treatment of geriatric PEs that should be devised in the future. In addition, a relevant number of potential DDIs were found to be associated with drug administration in the ED. For prevention and early detection of ADRs possibly caused by DDIs, comprehensive monitoring of various clinical parameters should be carried out following treatment in the ED.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section21-20451253251339373" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-20451253251339373" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-tpp-10.1177_20451253251339373 &#8211; Supplemental material for Drug utilization in geriatric psychiatric patients in the emergency department&#8212;a cohort study under real-world conditions</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sj-docx-1-tpp-10.1177_20451253251339373.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-tpp-10.1177_20451253251339373 for Drug utilization in geriatric psychiatric patients in the emergency department&#8212;a cohort study under real-world conditions by Martin Schulze Westhoff, Sophie Bannasch, Johannes Heck, Stefan Bleich, Sebastian Schr&#246;der and Adrian Groh in Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iDs:</bold> Martin Schulze Westhoff <inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1177_20451253251339373-img1.jpg"/>
