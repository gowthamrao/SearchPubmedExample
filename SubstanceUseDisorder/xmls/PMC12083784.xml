We aimed to determine and validate whether prescriber networks, constructed with administrative data, can successfully identify distinct clinical practice facilities in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We executed a retrospective population-based cohort study using OAT prescription records from the Canadian Addiction Treatment Centres in Ontario, Canada between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2020. Social network analysis was utilized to create networks with connections between physicians based on their shared OAT clients. We defined connections two different ways, by including the number of clients shared or a relative threshold on the percentage of shared OAT clients per physician. Clinics were identified using modularity maximization, with sensitivity analyses applying Louvain, Walktrap, and Label Propagation algorithms. Concordance between network-identified facilities and the (gold standard) de-identified facility-level IDs was assessed using overall, positive and negative agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>From 144 physicians at 105 clinics with 32,842 OAT clients, we assessed 250 different versions of the created networks. The three different detection algorithms had wide variation in concordance, with ranges on sensitivity from 0.02 to 0.88 and PPV from 0.06 to 0.97. The optimal result, derived from the modularity maximization method, achieved high specificity (0.98, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98) and NPV (0.98, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98) and moderate PPV (0.54, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.57) and sensitivity (0.45, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.47). This scenario had an overall agreement of 0.96, negative agreement of 0.98, and positive agreement of 0.49.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Social network analysis can be used to identify clinics prescribing OAT in the absence of clinic-level identifiers, thus facilitating construction and comparison of clinic-level caseloads and treatment outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DA050629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2513-3718</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Nosyk</surname><given-names>Bohdan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-190265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2513-3718</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Nosyk</surname><given-names>Bohdan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research award number no.

As defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, care coordination is the &#8220;deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants involved in a patient&#8217;s care to facilitate appropriate delivery of health care services&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is the standard treatment for opioid use disorder and improving treatment retention has been a key component in public health strategies to reduce the risk of overdose and subsequent mortality among PWOUD [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While structural and individual-level characteristics have an impact on retention in OAT [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], clinic-level characteristics, such as receiving care at a specialized treatment center or hospital [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], are also important determinants of OAT retention [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which are directly amenable to systemic intervention.</p><p>Within Canada, 80% of all Canadians receiving OAT reside in Ontario or British Columbia (BC) [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The largest treatment provider organization in Ontario is the Canadian Addiction Treatment Centre (CATC), which operates outpatient and inpatient treatment, with specialized pharmacies [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In BC, OAT is provided through specialized treatment centres, such as rapid access to addiction care clinics, community health centers and physicians&#8217; private offices. Like Ontario, BC boasts comprehensive linked health administrative data, however clinic-level identifiers are not available within these databases [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], thus limiting the opportunity for clinic-level comparisons in practice patterns and outcomes. Federal and Provincial governments have proposed increasing connections to care and collaborative care practices as interventions to improve outcomes for individuals with substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse recommends single assessment processes, shared medical records and centralized access points as mechanisms to work towards collaborative care [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Evaluating the performance of collaborative care and speciality clinics can be labour-intensive and thus cost-prohibitive when conducted through observations of practices, qualitative interviews and surveys. The use of administrative data may be feasible for routine, ongoing evaluation but many datasets, lack or suppress facility-level identifiers, including only de-identified provider information. Two previous studies conducted in the United States demonstrated that patient-sharing, identified using administrative data, is an informative measure for determining relationships between physicians [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. More recently, a study used Medicare data to identify shared care between primary care providers [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Given the case mix complexity and potential need for multidisciplinary care for people presenting with OUD, these methods require validation within this population and care context to ensure accuracy. However, no studies exist to validate the use of social network analysis to measure relationships among OAT physicians, and further identify clinics when administrative data lacks the identifying information on facilities or survey data is unavailable. The inclusion of de-identified clinic identifiers in Ontario&#8217;s CATC data presents an opportunity to fill this gap.</p><p>Social network analysis can be further applied to identify the impact of these networks on patient outcomes and health care system performance through the evaluation of care coordination [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While care coordination is challenging to measure through administrative claims data, &#8220;care density&#8221; is a surrogate measure which suggests that indirectly, through having visits with the same patients, physicians develop relationships that result in opportunities for direct communication and information sharing that may lower barriers to care coordination and ultimately lower costs [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other applications of social network analysis include improving the implementation of new policies or clinical guidelines through network interventions that utilize the theory of diffusion of innovation by identifying and targeting individuals or groups for behaviour change [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Validating the identification of clinics via administrative data provides the groundwork to identify and target groups of clinicians on a clinic-by-clinic basis for a segmentation style network intervention [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] while utilizing the lower evaluation cost associated with administrative data.</p><p>We aimed to determine whether prescriber networks, constructed via de-identified physician IDs in daily drug dispensation records, can successfully identify distinct clinical practices. We employ electronic medical record data from the largest network of physicians providing OAT in Canada (a group of 105 OAT clinics in Ontario, Canada) to assess the concordance between constructed prescriber networks and actual relationships between physicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>To validate the physician communities identified through the network analysis we considered whether physician pairs treated any clients at the same clinic as the gold standard and compared with the physician pairs&#8217; community (network identified clinic) that was assigned through our analysis.

CATC is a network of 105 treatment centers in Ontario, Canada that captures OAT prescriptions, clinic identifiers, prescriber identifiers and client identifiers [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The cohort was comprised of all physicians with a prescription from a clinic within the CATC network between January 2013 and December 2020. We defined physician-clinic connection as any OAT prescriber with a record in a given clinic. Physician- and clinic-client connection was defined as any OAT prescription between the physician and/or clinic and the OAT client.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data collection and ethics approval</title><p>Data were obtained on February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021, from CATC. The data were de-identified and all individual-level characteristics were removed prior to analysis. We received approval from the Laurentian University Research and Ethics Board for this study (Approval number 6020852).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Prescriber Network construction</title><p>We used de-identified clinic-level identifiers in the CATC dataset, based on prescription records of the prescribing physician, as our gold standard indication of a prescriber&#8217;s clinic membership. Social network analysis was utilized to create a network with connections between physicians based on their shared OAT clients. A network is defined as a set of &#8216;actors&#8217; (prescribers) with &#8216;relational ties&#8217; (shared clients) [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As the network was constructed on the prescriber-level, a &#8216;connection&#8217; between two prescribers entailed prescription to at least one shared OAT client. Within the network, the connections were weighted to represent the total number of shared OAT clients, such that the greater the weighted tie, the more clients were shared between prescribers. Sub-network groups, commonly referred to as &#8216;communities&#8217; in the network literature, were identified based on statistically non-random connections using modularity maximization [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This involved assigning prescribers to disjoint communities through comparing the differences between the true number of shared clients and the number of expected by chance, given each prescriber&#8217;s client loads. We applied the modularity maximization procedure recursively to identify smaller sub-group more likely to be representative of clinics, as seen in Stein et al (2017) [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Concordance was assessed through several measures, including percent overall agreement, positive agreement, negative agreement and Gwet&#8217;s agreement coefficient (AC<sub>1</sub>). Gwet&#8217;s AC<sub>1</sub> was chosen over Cohen&#8217;s Kappa as it is more reliable in scenarios with low prevalence and imbalanced marginal probabilities [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also calculated the sensitivity (probability for a physician pair to be grouped in a network-identified community together when they are attached to the same clinic), specificity (probability for a physician pair to be in separate network-identified communities when they do not practice at the same clinics), positive predictive value (PPV; probability of a physician pair practicing at the same clinic when they are grouped in a network-identified community) and negative predictive value (NPV; probability of a physician pair practicing at different clinics when they are in different network-identified communities). Following previous studies that validated network-identified clinics [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] we also estimated recall (the percentage of physicians in the network-identified clinic that are in the true clinic), 1-purity (percentage of physicians in the network-identified clinic that are not in the true clinic) and the F-measure (the harmonic mean of purity and recall values of each network-identified clinic, where a maximum value of 1 indicates perfect agreement) for the network-identified clinics.</p><p>Several sensitivity analyses were executed to ensure the results were robust. We applied several alternative definitions of ties in the network, including different minimum numbers of shared clients (absolute thresholds), retaining only the top 20&#8211;80 percent of a physicians weighted ties (based on shared clients, relative threshold), and ties defined on shared OAT clients treated during the same OAT episode (defined as continuous OAT without treatment gaps lasting at least 5 days for methadone or 6 days of buprenorphine/naloxone [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). We also applied several different definitions of physician-clinic connection, were we defined a physician-clinic connection if the clinic was where the physician prescribed to the majority of their OAT clients or prescribed to more than 15, 30 or 45 percent of their total OAT clients. In addition to the modularity maximization method to identify disjoint communities, we compared the Walktrap [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Louvain [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] methods to test different identification algorithms, as they have been used in other community detection studies [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We also compared the Label Propagation [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] algorithm, although it has not been used in community detection studies among prescribers. Lastly, we used several different recursive iterations of the modularity maximization procedure to define the smaller communities. To identify which algorithm was best for detection of communities, we prioritized sensitivity and positive predictive value, while expecting that specificity and negative predictive value should be high due to the large amount of true physician-pairs that do not care for clients at the same clinics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Characteristics of physicians, clinics and identified facilities</title><p>We included 144 physicians treating 32,842 OAT clients at 105 clinics over the 7-year study period to assess 350 different versions of the created networks (<xref rid="pone.0322064.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).

Using a relative percentage to define network ties with two or three recursive iterations of the modularity maximization algorithm were identified as the best performing strategies for constructing network-defined clinics due to high specificity and NPV and moderate PPV and sensitivity. The misclassification from the algorithm occurred when physicians had low client loads or comparably high client loads across multiple clinics.</p><p>Generally, use of administrative databases for evaluation and quality improvement has limitations, particularly with missing information and the lack of identifying indicators for clinical sites and referral networks. These limitations are exceptionally relevant for clinical OUD management in the fentanyl-era, when rapidly accessible specialty addictions clinics [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and collaborative care [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have been introduced as one component to combat the declines in treatment retention and persistently high rates of overdose death among people who use drugs [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. By validating the identification of clinics, we provide an opportunity to distinguish and evaluate clinical caseloads and clinic-level performance among databases that lack clinic-level identifiers, thus improving the use of administrative health records for ongoing evaluation and quality improvement particularly for opioid use disorder. Additionally in other clinical areas, care coordination, measured through indicators such as care density and centrality, has shown to have an impact on rates of hospitalization, health care costs, as well as on the referral and prescribing practices of physicians [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A previous study in the United States analyzed insurance claims to demonstrate that patients receiving care from doctors with higher levels of shared patients (i.e., higher care density) had significantly lower total costs and rates of hospitalization [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Otherwise, another study in the United States applied network analysis to demonstrate that higher care density is associated with a reduction in repeated co-prescription of interacting drugs by multiple providers [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Centrality, which describes the importance or influence of a node within a network, is another indicator of coordination [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For example, Barnett et al. compared the relative ratio of primary care physician (PCP) centrality to other physicians&#8217; centrality to quantify the average centrality of PCPs compared to other physicians in a network and found that higher &#8220;centrality&#8221; of primary care providers within constructed hospital networks was associated with fewer medical specialist visits, as well as lower spending on imaging and tests [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Validation of network-constructed clinics may therefore have broader implications and applicability in programmatic and health system evaluation.</p><p>Identifying facilities with administrative data otherwise provides an opportunity for enhanced control of confounding, which may be otherwise unmeasured in comparative effectiveness studies, when there is a lack of clinic-level identifiers. A previous study that identified predictors of selection into OAT had estimated individual and prescriber-level impacts with residual variance between prescribers [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This unexplained variance could be related to clinic-level characteristics that were unable to be determined previously. Furthermore, measures of prescribing preferences are commonly used in comparative effectiveness studies using instrumental variable analysis to address unmeasured confounding by indication [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A 2021 systematic review of preference-based instrumental variable designs found that of 185 articles, 40% had implemented a facility-level measure of prescribing preference [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], highlighting another important use to identifying clinics with administrative data that lacks facility-level identifiers. Additionally, as physicians&#8217; peers&#8217; prescribing habits has been shown to impact treatment uptake and selection of medications [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], these outcomes could be improved by identifying the impact of clinic level prescribing practices.</p><p>The results from our chosen &#8216;best-performing&#8217; settings had an estimated PPV of 0.54 and sensitivity of 0.45 which is comparable to the study by Kuo et al on US Medicare clients with similar sensitivity, however slightly lower PPVs [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Specifically, when Kuo et al defined a tie as at least 14 shared patient they had nearly the same sensitivity. However, we had much higher estimates for specificity and NPV. This may be explained by the administrative data having a higher proportion of physicians not practicing at the same clinics because they are easily identified if they do not share patients. Another previous study had similar results with a shared patient threshold of 3, resulting in a PPV of 0.60, sensitivity of 0.57, and specificity of 0.77, however their NPV was lower at 0.76 and their goal was to identify referral relationships, not team-based clinics [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Overall, our results align with other studies and confirm administrative databases can be used to identify physician relationships and clinics.</p><p>Prior studies building physician networks used an absolute shared patient threshold utilizing Medicare from the United States [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, we found that when network ties were defined based on relative percentage thresholds the results were concordant among all of the percentage-based definitions. As such, and consistent with the findings and recommendations of Landon et al [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], our results suggest using relative thresholds over absolute shared patient thresholds for network construction to accommodate diverse clinical contexts with varying patient loads and case complexities. Another study by Landon et al suggested similar, as absolute thresholds will vary for different specialties [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While Landon et al did not report their results and comparisons, they concluded that defining a connection based on a relative threshold of the top 20% of ties was the best option [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other studies evaluating prescriber networks defined connections based on episodes of care [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We found that episodes of care also had similar results to relative thresholds, suggesting that both definitions create valid prescriber networks.</p><p>Overall, our study found that Walktrap and Louvain algorithms underperformed compared to the modularity maximization algorithm. While there is no precedent in the prescriber networks literature that evaluated the use of different community detection algorithms, other complex network studies have evaluated differences in detection algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There is not a single algorithm that prevails as the optimal algorithm for community detection among different types of networks (i.e., small and large networks) and performance measures. For example, the Louvain algorithm provided the best fit in two studies [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], while the modularity maximization algorithm was superior in Berardo de Sousa et al [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our modularity maximization method was different, such that we followed Stein et al&#8217;s approach of recursive application to find smaller communities. After the third iteration, we found the minimal increase in PPV resulted in larger decrease of sensitivity, suggesting that higher iterations are unnecessary. This aligns with Stein et al, as they found the best split for minimum community sizes with minimum number of total communities was 3.3, aligning with our results that second or third iteration was best [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our study was not without limitations. First, as physicians treated clients at multiple OAT clinics in Ontario, the network-identified communities will necessarily result in a degree of misclassification as a physician can only be assigned to a single community. To address this concern, we used multiple definitions for physician-clinic connection. In other settings and provinces physicians often work in multiple clinics, and we found the algorithm captures true groupings from clinics with at least 15% of the physicians&#8217; client-load. The algorithm may not be reliable at detecting clinics which exclusively or primarily employ prescribers with a small number of clients relative to the physicians&#8217; overall client-load. Future analyses should employ other sensitivity analyses, such as different detection algorithms and connection definitions to ensure clinic identification is consistent. While physicians often work in multiple clinics, our methodology required prescribers to be assigned to only one clinic. Algorithms to detect overlapping communities within weighted networks exist, such as the Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], however they have not been used in prior prescriber network literature and are not widely implemented in software. Second, for the express purpose of defining OAT clinics, we focus our only on OAT prescription records. It is possible that some OAT physicians could also be working at non-OAT clinics and sharing non-OAT patients which we would not capture. The methodology can be extended in other applications to capture any prescriptions, or any records of care provision, between shared clients. We note however the unique benefits of using OAT prescription records, given requirements for frequent (weekly or biweekly) prescription renewals. We note that the method was validated to identify primary care offices in Texas using outpatient care records from US Medicare data [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and communities within 51 different hospital referral regions using inpatient and outpatient care records from US Medicare data [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Elsewhere it has be implemented to identify hospital referral regions in England using hospital admission records to measure infection transfers between hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0322064.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>This analysis examined OAT prescriber network characteristics with the aim of validating the use of administrative data for identifying OAT prescriber networks. Identifying OAT prescriber networks from health administrative data can help determine the impact of physician networks on OAT outcomes and provide recommendations to improve collaborative care.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0322064.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"

This type of analysis is rarely conducted, and I commend the authors for addressing such an under-explored area. However, a key concern is the practical implications of the findings.

What can we do with the results of this analysis? While the paper includes some discussion on this, I found the arguments to be somewhat underdeveloped and not entirely convincing.</p><p>Response: We have edited the discussion to highlight more on how this validation can be used with administrative data for opioid use disorder in particular.</p><p>(page 14, paragraph 2, line 255): &#8220;Generally, use of administrative databases for evaluation and quality improvement has limitations, particularly with missing information and the lack of identifying indicators for clinical sites and referral networks. These limitations are exceptionally relevant for clinical OUD management in the fentanyl-era, when rapidly accessible specialty addictions clinics(40) and collaborative care(1, 4) have been introduced as one component to combat the declines in treatment retention and persistently high rates of overdose death among people who use drugs(8, 41-43). By validating the identification of clinics, we provide an opportunity to distinguish and evaluate clinical caseloads and clinic-level performance among databases that lack clinic-level identifiers, thus improving the use of administrative health records for ongoing evaluation and quality improvement particularly for opioid use disorder. Additionally in other clinical areas, &#8230;&#8221;</p><p>(page 15, paragraph 2, line 282): &#8220;Identifying facilities with administrative data otherwise provides an opportunity for enhanced control of confounding, which may be otherwise unmeasured in comparative effectiveness studies, when there is a lack of clinic-level identifiers. &#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Another important point is the justification for the chosen statistical methods. For instance, while modularity maximization is a widely used approach for identifying subgroups, it would be helpful to explain why this method was preferred over other, potentially more advanced alternatives.</p><p>Response: We previously tested two different community detection alternatives, including: Walktrap and Louvain and have made this clearer. While Louvain also applies modularity maximization, Walktrap does not. However, we added the Label Propagation algorithm to test an additional community detection alternative that does not optimize modularity.</p><p>(page 9, paragraph 1, line 167): &#8220;In addition to the modularity maximization method to identify disjoint communities, we compared the Walktrap(38) and Louvain(39) methods to test different identification algorithms &#8230; We also compared the Label Propagation(40) algorithm, although it has not been used in community detection studies among prescribers.&#8221;</p><p>(page 11, paragraph 2, line 213): &#8220;Results from the Walktrap, Louvain, and Label Propagation algorithms had lower specificity and PPV compared to the modularity maximization algorithm &#8230; Label Propagation had the highest sensitivity, with the drawbacks of the lowest PPV and specificity.&#8221;</p><p>Additionally, the definitions of certain evaluation measures could be clarified. For example, readers without a strong statistical background may not be familiar with terms such as Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or Negative Predictive Value (NPV). Providing clearer definitions or brief explanations would improve accessibility and understanding for a broader audience.</p><p>Response: We have added a basic descriptive of each term, relative to their meaning for this analysis.</p><p>(page 8, paragraph 2, line 144): &#8220;We also calculated the sensitivity (probability for a physician pair to be grouped in a network-identified community together when they are attached to the same clinic), specificity (probability for a physician pair to be in separate network-identified communities when they do not practice at the same clinics), positive predictive value (PPV; probability of a physician pair practicing at the same clinic when they are grouped in a network-identified community) and negative predictive value (NPV; probability of a physician pair practicing at different clinics when they are in different network-identified communities).&#8221;</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0322064.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PrescriberNetworkValidation_reviewresponse_v1.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0322064.s007.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0322064.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0322064.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Mazza</surname><given-names initials="M">Marianna</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Marianna Mazza</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Marianna Mazza</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj004" xml:lang="en" journal-id="PLoS One" journal-id-type="nlm-ta" ext-link-type="pubmed" xlink:href="40378100"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
