Different methodologies have been used in the literature for this purpose, but the implications of using one methodology or another have not been clearly assessed. Our aim was to compare different methods to measure alcohol outlet density and highlight under which characteristics of the environment might be best using each approach. We used Geographic Information Systems to geolocate schools (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 576) and alcohol outlets (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21,732) in Madrid. We defined the density of alcohol outlets as the number of establishments within an area of 400 m around schools measured using two buffering methods: crow flies&#8217; and street network distances. We evaluated the agreement between both methods visually and through regression models, including street connectivity, population density, and density of recreational venues as predictors of disagreement. The density of alcohol outlets around schools was higher using crow&#160;flies&#8217; distances compared to street network distances. The differences between methodologies were wider in areas of higher density of outlets, especially in the downtown areas, where there are higher population density and street connectivity. Our results suggest that the spatial characteristics and morphology of the study area (e.g., street connectivity and population density) should be considered when deciding the methodology to be used to measure alcohol outlet density. Future studies should explore the implications of different exposure measures in their association with drinking prevalence and consumption patterns among different geographical contexts.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11524-023-00740-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alcohol accessibility</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>GIS</kwd><kwd>Buffers</kwd><kwd>Bland-Altman analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Predoctoral Contract from the Spanish Government </institution></funding-source><award-id>FPU20/03025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mart&#237;n-Turrero</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD026429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Bilal</surname><given-names>Usama</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Spanish Government Youth Guarantee Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>PEJD-2019-PRE/SAL-16330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Berasaluce</surname><given-names>Maitane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Alcal&#225; and the Community of Madrid </institution></funding-source><award-id>CM/JIN/2019-021</award-id><award-id>CM/JIN/2021-030</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universidad de Alcal&#225;</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The New York Academy of Medicine 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sociodemographic, geographic, and cultural factors influence alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among these factors are the physical, social, and cultural features of the environment. Physical features include the density of or proximity to alcohol outlets in the neighborhoods where people live, work, and play. For example, higher levels of alcohol outlets in the environment reduce the time and effort that people need to obtain alcohol products and are associated with higher rates of drinking and health and social problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This might be especially problematic in areas near schools with a high presence of vulnerable populations, such as adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Social features of neighborhoods include socio-economic deprivation, which is positively associated with a higher density of alcohol outlets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">However, there are still inconsistent results in the literature regarding the influence of the urban context in individual behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A wide range of methods has been used to evaluate this exposure, measuring the accessibility to and availability of alcohol around spaces frequented by individuals (i.e., residences, schools, or working places) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Such heterogeneity in the methods might be the cause of the inconsistencies found in the results in the literature. For instance, studies using alcohol outlet density measures to examine the contextual drivers of alcohol consumption have used a diversity of calculations: the number of alcohol outlets per 1000 inhabitants by the district of residence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the number of outlets within 1 km Euclidean buffers from the participant&#8217;s home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or the density of outlets per square kilometer within the participant&#8217;s census tract of residence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], among others. The proliferation of these diverse methods has occurred in consonance with the rapid technological developments in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) during the last years.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to the methods commented above, there is an increasing number of studies that use Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies to generate exposure measures at an individual level, considering the exact areas they usually visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These approaches constitute an applied example of the <italic toggle="yes">Uncertain Geographic Context Problem</italic> (UGCoP), developed by Chen and Kwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In brief, the UGCoP refers to the problem of how the effects of area-based attributes (e.g., the density of alcohol outlets) on individual behaviors (alcohol use) could be affected by how the neighborhood or study area in which we aim to measure the alcohol exposure is defined. However, the use of these complex GPS-based methods is highly expensive, time-consuming, and often difficult to interpret and translate into concrete policy actions. A common alternative to this method is the creation of buffers using GIS to approach the immediate (and hypothetical) neighborhoods of the residential or school area in which the individuals might satisfy their primary needs. A buffer is an area resulting from a distance calculation around a specific location (e.g., home or school coordinates), considering a given parameter of distance measured from that point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Many studies in the literature have used buffers around the place of residence to evaluate the availability and accessibility that individuals have to different drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There are several forms to estimate buffers, being the most common ones those calculated with crow flies&#8217; and street network distances. In brief, the crow flies&#8217; buffers represent a circular area around a specific point, where the buffer radius is delineated using a straight line without considering obstacles in space. On the other hand, street network buffers are delineated using walkable distances through the streets, and thus, their shape is usually irregular. However, the complexity of the calculation and the accuracy of these options make this choice not trivial. From a methodological point of view, street network buffers show a more realistic view of alcohol availability and accessibility by considering only the paths through which an individual would walk to reach a store or alcohol outlet. In turn, crow-fly buffers do not account for physical barriers to the distance accessibility to alcohol outlets, such as the presence of water bodies, railway tracks, non-pedestrian paths, and crosswalks. However, the use of crow flies&#8217; might provide some advantages towards street network ones in some cases, as well. Crow-fly buffers require less complex computation and less software requirements to its calculation. In addition, data on the street network are not always available and may contain important inaccuracies depending on the study area (e.g., cities in developing countries may have a poor spatial data infrastructure).</p><p id="Par6">The specific implications of using either crow flies&#8217; or street network-based buffers in the results obtained from the exposure measures have not been assessed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, we hypothesize that these implications may vary according to the characteristics of the study area, in terms of their geography or urban morphology. To better understand the implications of this choice, we aimed to calculate the density of alcohol outlets around secondary schools in the city of Madrid using these two types of buffers. The objective is to compare both calculations and to point out the advantages of each one, in relation to the neighborhood geographic and urban morphology characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Area</title><p id="Par7">This study was conducted in the city of Madrid, which constitutes the largest municipality in Spain with more than 3.3 million inhabitants, concentrated in a spatial extension of 606 sq. km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which translates into an average population density of 5445.54 inhabitants per sq. km.

For instance, when comparing Madrid&#8217;s downtown (e.g., Centro District) and a typical periphery neighborhood (e.g., Barajas District), central areas present a mean population density which is 22 times higher (25,233.92 vs 1118.15 inhabitants per sq. km, respectively), a recreational venue density 11 times bigger (344.83 vs 30.34 recreational venues per sq. km.; mean whole city = 58.52), and a mean street connectivity density 3 times greater (1474.57 vs 500.14 intersections per sq. km.; mean whole city value = 874.66) (data calculated by the authors).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design and Databases</title><p id="Par9">We organized this study in three steps. First, we calculated the alcohol outlet density around secondary schools (see the &#8220;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec"><italic toggle="yes">Alcohol outlet exposure measures</italic></xref>&#8221; section) using the two different buffer methods mentioned before. Second, we generated a set of geographic covariates using GIS, defined as population density, recreational venues density, and street network connectivity (see the &#8220;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec"><italic toggle="yes">Generation and description of geographic covariates</italic></xref>&#8221; section). We modeled these covariates as predictors of the disagreement between alcohol outlet densities around schools estimated using both crow&#160;flies&#8217; and street network buffers. The population density covariate was defined to procure a proxy of the degree of urban compactness. Recreational venue density was used to introduce an indicator of land use diversity across the city. Specifically, areas with low recreational venue density were accounted as predominantly residential neighborhoods, while those with high recreational venue density were considered to have a mixed land use (i.e., more diversity: residential, commercial, business, etc.). Similarly, we included street network connectivity as the street network buffer calculation directly relies on the urban connectivity features in contrast to the crow flies&#8217; buffer one. Finally, we performed a statistical comparison of factors driving differences between buffers (see the &#8220;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec"><italic toggle="yes">Comparison analysis between measures</italic></xref>&#8221; section).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Alcohol Outlet Exposure Measures</title><p id="Par10">Alcohol outlet density around each school was estimated using GIS.

The KDE are a geographic measure which provides a continuous density surface (i.e., raster) across the study area.

We also calculated the relative difference between densities by doing a density ratio (log-transforming both densities) for sensitivity analyses.</p><p id="Par17">To measure the magnitude of the differences between the two methods taking the 400 m buffers, we fitted a negative binomial generalized linear model (NBGLM) where the crow&#160;flies&#8217; measure was the dependent variable and the street network measure was the independent variable. We also included in the model the geographical covariates described above, plus an additional measure on neighborhood deprivation (socioeconomic status). We considered it appropriate to include this measure to account for variations due to potential social features of the environment in our analyses. Specifically, socioeconomic deprivation measures (SES) have been described as a good predictor for the density of alcohol outlets around schools too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We estimated the neighborhood deprivation measure by combining different socioeconomic indicators based on educational level, employment, occupational status, and housing prices. The composition of this measure has been previously described and used elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio 1.4.1103 (R Core Team, 2019).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par19">There were 576 secondary schools and 21,732 alcohol outlets in the city of Madrid. All of them were successfully geocoded, and the densities of alcohol outlets around schools were calculated. A representation of the Bland-Altman plot for the absolute comparison of the two density measurements is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, with the dashed line representing the line of equality (where both methods completely agree). Points above this line represent a higher density using the crow flies&#8217; method, while points below this line represent a higher density using the street network method. On average, the crow-fly buffers measure 31.08 alcohol outlets more around schools than the street network buffers (limits of agreement: &#8722;33.99 to 96.14 alcohol outlets). The analyses assessing relative differences between the two methods showed no variation according to the basal density (i.e., 12/10 is the same as 120/100; however, 12&#8211;10 is smaller than 120&#8211;100). In other words, the two methods (crow flies&#8217; and street network) give a relatively equal response regardless of basal density, but the absolute difference is greater with higher basal density. We observed the same trends when we analyzed the 200 m and 800 m buffers (see Supplemental Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Bland-Altman plot compares the number of alcohol outlets around schools measured using 400 m crow&#160;flies&#8217; buffers and street network buffers.

Density calculations based on crow&#160;flies&#8217; buffers registered higher densities of alcohol outlets than those based on street network buffers of the same size, which varied according to other contextual factors of the study area, including population density and street network connectivity. This offers an interesting lecture, where we can interpret that the alcohol outlet density values per area remain stable (or even increase) as we move further from schools. Differences between measurements were larger in areas with higher population density and with a more densely connected street network. It is known that a crow&#160;flies&#8217; buffer encompasses a larger territory (i.e., spatial extent) than a street network buffer of the same diameter; thus, it might also have a larger number of outlets inside. However, the difference between the spatial extent of the two buffers will depend on the street connectivity of the study area. In areas with higher street connectivity, the differences between the crow&#160;flies&#8217; and street network buffers in terms of their spatial extent will be usually larger. Moreover, areas with high population density are usually areas where the street network connectivity is higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In the literature, there is not a standardized methodology to measure alcohol outlet density in urban areas. As discussed in the &#8220;Introduction&#8221; section, this might be the reason why different studies that related alcohol outlet density with patterns of consumption concluded different findings. These kinds of disparities have been highlighted in other environments related to urban health, as well. A systematic review about the tobacco environment discussed the association between tobacco consumption and its accessibility and availability approached using different methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This work found that the use of different methods affected the direction and magnitude of the association between exposure and outcomes. For example, most of the studies that used KDE found positive associations between tobacco outlet density and smoking prevalence. Also, those studies which estimated tobacco outlet densities as counts within crow flies&#8217; buffers reported a higher number of positive associations with smoking prevalence than those which used counts within street network buffers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, future research should not only be focused on finding the best methodology, but in trying to unify which methodology should be used by all researchers according to the geographical and morphological characteristics of the area, in order to be able to compare studies carried in different geographical zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Our results enlight us that, depending on the characteristics of the study area, the results of the estimated alcohol outlet densities might vary depending on the type and size of the chosen buffer. This study was developed in the city of Madrid, which is characterized by a dense urban morphology (with a high percentage of the population concentrated in a limited space, living in tall-building apartments), higher degrees of land use diversification, and a generally irregular and dense street network pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This type of urban morphology is typical amongst European and Mediterranean cities. Other settings, such as Anglo-Saxon countries, are characterized by a less densely urban morphology with a higher urban sprawl throughout regular street network patterns which leads to lower population densities (e.g., Melbourne in Australia presented a lower population density compared to Madrid, 2640.65 vs 5459.51 inhabitants per sq. km.) and a segregated land use distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Understanding and recognizing these particular geographies are crucial when examining which type of exposure measure would be the most appropriate to our analyses in our study setting.</p><p id="Par25">Our findings can also be useful in order to propose future alcohol legislation at a national and international level. It has been proven that higher densities of alcohol outlets (measured with both, crow&#160;flies&#8217;, and street network buffers) around schools and residences predict higher alcohol consumption in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, policies should focus on reducing alcohol outlet availability and accessibility by establishing minimum distances between schools and alcohol outlets, in order to decrease exposure and opportunities to buy alcohol in adolescents. For example, in Ireland, The Public Health (Alcohol) Act (2018) outlawed alcohol advertising within 200 m from schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and in California, the minimum distance from schools for new licensed liquor stores has to be 600 ft (182.88 m) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, they do not specify if those buffers are measured using crow&#160;flies&#8217; or street network distances. In this line, it may be interesting to use buffers in Madrid to establish the limits from which the alcohol outlets should not be present. Then the most pertinent type of measure to do so should be evaluated accounting with the geographical caracteristics of the study area such as the urban morphology (e.g., street connectivity, population density, and recreational venues density).</p><p id="Par26">In the case of our study conducted in Madrid, future policies applying crow&#160;flies&#8217; buffers to restrict alcohol outlet availability near schools might achieve better outcomes. Similar results have been evinced by other studies in tobacco control research and might be also extrapolated to other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, these policies might be useful to tackle other public health issues, such as the health inequalities caused by the differences in alcohol outlet density found around schools depending on the SES of the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Our study has some limitations. First, the study was restricted to an urban area with high street connectivity and population density. It would be interesting to do similar studies in rural areas and in urban areas where the land use distribution might be vastly different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], especially since we found that the differences between methods vary according to these characteristics. Moreover, another limitation is that there is not a comparison between the association of drinking behaviors with the exposure measurements defined by different types of buffers. Future studies could dive into this question, using standard and consistent methods, and comparing if one method gives more positive associations with drinking patterns than the other.</p><p id="Par28">This study suggests that characteristics and morphology of the study area, such as street network connectivity (accounted here as the density of street intersections) or urban compactness (approached here as population density), constitute important factors to consider when assessing the most suitable method to calculate exposure measures to approach alcohol availability. From a policy perspective, our results could anticipate that future interventions focused on crow flies&#8217; buffers might lead to a higher percent of reductions in the alcohol outlet densities around the schools in Madrid. Similar results could be valid for other international settings. Finally, the methodological steps performed in this study (i.e., Bland-Altman, cartography and regression) might be replicated in future studies based on different international settings when analyzing the appropriate method to approach alcohol outlet exposure around schools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec10"><p>
