In contrast, several other systemic autoimmune diseases, including SLE, can cause secondary APS.

The patient mentioned that he started to complain an intermittent, central, and burning chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder for 5 days duration which was first evaluated as the outpatient clinic by computed tomography scan of the chest which ruled out pulmonary embolism. Past medical history was significant for two attacks of extensive deep venous thrombosis in the right lower limb; the first episode was before 8 months and the second one was 3 months ago despite of being on rivaroxaban. the patient&#8217;s sister had five recurrent pregnancy losses during the second trimester of each pregnancy. The patient reported no personal and/or family history of cancer, any acute, repeat, or discontinued medications, any allergies, any genetic or psychosocial issues, and had a free past surgical history. The pain did not relieve and progressed over days to be at rest with retrosternal burning nature.</p><p>Physical examination revealed a conscious, and alert patient with stable blood pressure and normal cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examinations. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with heart rate of 110&#160;beats/min and ST-segment elevation in leads II and aVf along with elevated troponin levels. The patient underwent an urgent cardiac catheterization which was unremarkable. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 30&#8211;35%, borderline left ventricular hypertrophy, lateral and inferior wall hypokinesia. Therefore, the diagnosis of myocarditis was established. Laboratory evaluation revealed a prolonged partial thromboplastin time of 105, mixing study was done and demonstrated no correction of prolonged partial thromboplastin time, positive LA, anticardiolipin, and B-2 glycoprotein antibodies. So, the patient was diagnosed with APS. On the second day of hospitalization, the complete blood count showed a sudden drop of hemoglobin levels from 16 to 11, platelet count from 170 to 69 with decreased serum albumin levels of 1.7. Urinanalysis showed proteinuria. Spot protein/creatinine showed nephrotic range proteinuria 4.5&#160;g, hematuria, and granular casts. Reticulocyte count was increased of 3.4% and lactate dehydrogenase of 436. The patient was suspected to have another multisystemic condition. Further laboratory investigations including antinuclear antibodies, cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, and direct Coombs were positive along with decreased levels of C3 but normal C4. Blood film showed full of spherocyte compatible with autoimmune hemolytic anemia</p><p>On the same day, the patient started to have a mild headache with blurred vision. Neuroimaging of the brain showed diffuse foci and areas of diffusion restriction in the centrum semiovale, subcortical white matter, and right cerebellar hemisphere reflecting hyperacute and acute ischemic insults (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The patient was diagnosed with SLEs involving the heart, brain, and kidney in the setting of APS. He was started immediately on a regimen consisting of pulse steroid therapy with a dose of 1&#160;g once daily for 3 days followed by 1&#160;mg/kg daily with tapering gradually 1 month later, and cyclophosphamide of 1000&#160;mg once monthly for a duration of 6 months with planning to switch him to another immunosuppressant agent. He also was kept on hydroxychloroquine 400&#160;mg twice daily and enoxaparin 1&#160;mg/kg with bridging to warfarin. The patient was followed up for 4 months with significant improvement. The patient also had a good tolerance of chemotherapy and pharmacological agents without any reported complications or adverse events.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>MRIs with different sequences as the following: T1 with contrast cerebellar enhancement (A), FLAIR (B), susceptibility-weighted image (C), T2 (D), DW2 (E and F), and diffusion-weighted images (G and H).</p><p>Arrows indicate acute ischemic changes.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ms9-85-1983-g001.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Autoantibodies that bind cell membrane phospholipids or phospholipid-binding proteins are present in the APS, and there may also be signs of arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis or obstetric problems<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.

Obstetric problems include repeated preterm birth due to placental insufficiency, late fetal loss, early-onset preeclampsia, and early pregnancy loss. A rare and potentially fatal variant of APS known as catastrophic APS manifests as several thrombotic problems almost simultaneously.

In the course of lupus nephritis, Tektonidou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> revealed that double aPL positivity (aCL and LA) is linked with aPL-nephropathy; more recently, Gerhardsson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> established that triple aPL positivity is associated with aPL-nephropathy in SLE patients. While thrombotic microangiopathy is acknowledged as a classification criterion for definite APS (small vessel thrombosis), the association between various aPL was inconsistent across studies, and it was unclear whether the frequency of chronic lesions was significantly higher in aPL-positive SLE patients compared with aPL-negative SLE patients. An updated meta-analysis of 1820 patients conducted by Domingues <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> showed that the prevalence of renal lesions in aPL-positive versus aPL-negative SLE patients was 31.9%.</p><p>SLE has been linked to a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms.
