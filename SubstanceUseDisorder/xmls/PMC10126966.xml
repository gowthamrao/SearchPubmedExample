It discusses key interlocking forces&#8212;the political investments of wealthy individuals and organizations and the nationalization of political parties&#8212;that spurred changes in states&#8217; contexts. We then speculate about key policy areas, namely voting, civil, and reproductive rights, that will be at the center of the continued polarization in state policy contexts over the next decade. We conclude with recommendations for future research on the role of state policy contexts on population health; provide thoughts on how to improve communications between researchers, policymakers, and the public; and outline policy priorities.</p><sec id="milq12617-sec-0030"><title>Large and Growing Differences in Population Health Across States</title><p>The chances of living long and healthy differ markedly across states. In 2019 (the last year for which state&#8208;level data are available from the US Mortality Database<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>), life expectancy ranged from 81.8 years in Hawaii to 74.7 years in Mississippi. If Hawaii were a country, it would have ranked 19<sup>th</sup> in the world in life expectancy, alongside Germany, the Netherlands, and Ireland. Mississippi would have ranked 80<sup>th</sup>, alongside Malaysia and Belarus. The 7.1&#8208;year difference in life expectancy across US states in 2019 was larger than that between the highest life expectancy country (Japan, 84.3 years) and the next 48 countries.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>People residing in states with relatively low life expectancy have a particularly high risk of dying young and suffering poor health while they are alive.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="milq12617-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> As a staggering example, mortality data from 2019 indicate that, for every 100 babies born that year in Mississippi, three will not survive to their 30<sup>th</sup> birthday, 10 will not live to their 50<sup>th</sup> birthday, and 24 will die before they can enjoy retirement at age 65.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Moreover, the years they do live are marked by elevated rates of morbidity and disability. A recent study using data from 2013&#8211;2017 found that men and women in Mississippi spend approximately 9% and 12%, respectively, of their adult years with a disability.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Although these differences across states have long existed, the magnitude has fluctuated over time. During the 1960s and 1970s, states were becoming more alike in terms of life expectancy.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> However, this convergence ended in the early 1980s. Since then, states have become increasingly unequal, as some states experienced sizable gains in life expectancy while others saw few gains and, more recently, declines. For example, in 1960, life expectancy in both Connecticut and Oklahoma was 71 years.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Over the next six decades, these states would markedly diverge, as shown in Figure&#160;<xref rid="milq12617-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Life expectancy in Connecticut climbed to 81 years by 2019, putting it in 6<sup>th</sup> place.

Many American lives are being cut short each year and this number will likely increase for years to come. In fact, life expectancy projections for the country overall are bleak. Without a concerted effort at the state or federal level to intervene, by 2040 the United States is projected to make fewer gains in life expectancy than other countries and fall more than any other high&#8208;income country in international rankings to 64<sup>th</sup> place.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0040"><title>The Important Role of States&#8217; Policy Contexts</title><p>Differences in life expectancy across states result from factors operating at multiple levels. A useful framework for identifying these factors comes from a 2021 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report, which was commissioned to examine the high and rising mortality rates among working&#8208;age adults in the United States.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> The framework shows that working&#8208;age mortality is affected by factors operating at the macro&#8208;structural level (e.g., state policies and corporations), meso level (e.g., workplaces), and individual&#8208;proximal level (e.g., health behaviors and socioeconomic circumstances). The report emphasized the importance of the macro&#8208;structural level because it exerts a strong influence on other levels. For instance, state policies affect individuals&#8217; access to affordable health insurance; state policies can influence health behaviors through tobacco excise taxes, marijuana legalization, alcohol pricing, opioid&#8208;prescribing regulations, and more; and state policies can influence individuals&#8217; economic circumstances through education expenditures, minimum wage levels, housing policy, taxes, and more. Other scholars have similarly underscored the profound role of policies and the political choices behind them, asserting that they are the &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">causes of the causes of the causes</italic> of geographic inequalities in health.&#8221;<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Corroborating these frameworks, recent studies implicate the tectonic shifts in states&#8217; policy contexts since the 1980s, and especially since 2000,<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>11</sup>
</xref> States have become highly active in policymaking. Since the 1980s, the annual rate in which states enact new policies has accelerated and is higher than ever recorded since 1800.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> The reasons for the high activity include factors such as the decentralization of certain policymaking authorities from the federal to state governments, rising influence of corporations and their interest groups on state policymaking, and many states&#8217; attempts to fill a vacuum in federal legislation on issues such as minimum wage, paid sick leave, and firearm safety.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="milq12617-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> At the same time, many states enacted preemption laws to remove or restrict local authority. For instance, in 2000 only 2 states preempted local authority to raise the minimum wage, but by 2019, 26 states did. These laws have recently proliferated, particularly in conservative states, to block liberal&#8208;leaning policies (e.g., mandating paid leave, raising minimum wage, banning single&#8208;use plastics) of their cities.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>The impact of this policymaking activity on people's pocketbooks and health is exacerbated by the fact that it has occurred in an era of hyperpolarization.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Consequently, many states have actively implemented policy &#8220;bundles&#8221; that lean politically left or right. For example, some states enacted Medicaid expansion <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> higher minimum wages <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> higher tobacco taxes <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> paid sick leave <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> supplemental earned income tax credits (EITC)&#8212;and these bundles appear to be paying dividends in improved health, health behaviors, and longevity in those states.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, <xref rid="milq12617-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> Another example of bundling comes from a study of state policies that impact perinatal and infant outcomes.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> It showed that some states have combined higher minimum wages <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> paid parental leave <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> tax credits <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> higher tobacco taxes, all of which improve those outcomes, while many other states bundled low minimum wages, no parental leave or tax credits, and low tobacco taxes. Recently, researchers using an innovative counterfactual research design concluded that the growing disparities in working&#8208;age mortality across states were due to growing differences in policy contexts and the bundling of policies.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">

Neither state had a supplemental EITC, paid sick leave laws, or right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws or preempted local authority to raise the minimum wage or mandate paid leave. They also had similar policies regarding key health behaviors. For example, the maximum weekly allotment for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was $331 in each state, excise taxes on a pack of cigarettes were a low 40 cents in Connecticut and 23 cents in Oklahoma, and while Connecticut had more firearm laws than Oklahoma (27 versus 10), this gap pales in comparison to the one that would emerge in subsequent decades.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="milq12617-tbl-0001" content-type="Table" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Polarizing Policy Contexts in Connecticut and Oklahoma Between 1990 and 2019</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000" rowspan="1">

Connecticut invested in its labor force and their families by raising its hourly minimum wage ($11) above the federal level ($7.25), implementing an EITC (with a credit of 23% of the federal EITC in 2019), and enacting paid sick leave. Oklahoma held its minimum wage at the federal level, implemented an EITC with a credit of 5% of the federal EITC, and did not mandate paid sick leave. In addition, it enacted right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws, which undercut the power of unions by prohibiting them from requiring membership dues, as well as preemption laws to prohibit local areas from raising their minimum wage or mandating paid leave. These two archetype states made many other opposite decisions. Connecticut participated in the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion (Oklahoma participated in 2021, seven years after Connecticut), substantially raised excise taxes on a pack of cigarettes to $4.35 in 2019 ($2.03 in Oklahoma), and increased the number of firearm laws from 27 to 91 between 1990 and 2019 (Oklahoma decreased the number of these laws from 10 to 8). This bundling of state policies has created one context that bolsters opportunities for people to achieve economic well&#8208;being and health, and another that puts formidable obstacles in the way by either taking no action (e.g., not raising the minimum wage to keep up with inflation) or deliberate action (e.g., right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws and preemption laws).</p><p>State policies such as those listed in Table&#160;<xref rid="milq12617-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> impact people's pocketbooks, physical and mental health, and longevity.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">

The first force is the tightening grip of corporations, their interest groups, and wealthy donors on state policymaking.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> While US corporations are not politically monolithic, they have tended to support lower taxes, fewer labor protections, and a smaller welfare state.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref> Their collective influence on state policy has grown in large part through the conduits of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), State Policy Network, and the Koch&#8208;funded Americans for Prosperity.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> The footprint of this &#8220;troika&#8221; on state policies is profound.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> For instance, ALEC has written numerous pro&#8208;business bills (e.g., stand&#8208;your&#8208;ground laws, right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws, and state preemption of local authority to raise the minimum wage), with input and funding from its corporate members. ALEC has been very successful in changing the policy contexts of many, mainly conservative states such as Oklahoma. For example, in his book documenting the influence of ALEC on state policies from 1995 to 2013, Hertel&#8208;Fernandez shows that Oklahoma was among the five states with the highest enactment rate of ALEC&#8208;crafted legislation and Connecticut was among the five states with the lowest rate.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>

<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="milq12617-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>53</sup>
</xref> The presumption of ALEC and its corporate members was that it would be easier to enact unpopular legislation if the public was unaware of it (Americans pay less attention to state policymaking than federal policymaking, owing partly to the decline of state and local journalism). In addition, it was considered preferable to be successful in some states than no states, the latter of which would happen if efforts to enact federal legislation failed. In sum, the coordinated efforts of corporations, their interest groups, and wealthy donors to change the nation's policy context &#8220;one state capital at a time&#8221; have been a stealthy force beind the policy bundling and polarization in recent decades.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>54</sup>
</xref> In other words, instead of a Tennessee version, an Arizona version, and a Florida version of the Republican Party, there is increasingly one national version, and it is increasingly at odds with the (also increasingly national) Democratic Party. This polarization and nationalization of the parties, especially the Republican Party, has been the result of long&#8208;term political investments by donors, organizations, and media, as well as the racial &#8220;sorting&#8221; of the parties. Over decades but especially recently, the Republican &#8220;Southern strategy&#8221; attracted racially conservative white voters, providing the party an electoral base that would vote based on racial, cultural, and immigration&#8208;based conflict rather than the party's performance in health and economic policy.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">

Oklahoma was one of the slowest to act, along with states like Florida, Texas, and Georgia. Connecticut also issued a public face mask mandate and a face mask mandate in schools for the 2021&#8211;2022 school year. Not only did Oklahoma refrain from enacting a public face mask mandate, but the state banned face mask mandates in schools and all buildings that the state leased or owned.</p><p>With growing fervor, many states have been enacting policies to dismantle rights that have long been protected by federal law, notably voting and reproductive rights. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2021 alone, "11&#160;states passed&#160;voting laws that were entirely restrictive, while 17 states passed laws that were entirely expansive.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>64</sup>
</xref> Some states have passed laws prohibiting so&#8208;called sanctuary cities. In recent years, many conservative states have proposed or passed legislation in direct response to culture wars. For instance, states have passed legislation that prohibits certain topics in schools like critical race theory and sexuality and gender identity (e.g., Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act). In addition to restricting classroom discussion on gender and sexual orientation, Alabama's 2022 Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act requires students to use restrooms and locker rooms based on the sex listed on their original birth certificate and makes it a felony to perform gender&#8208;affirming surgeries or prescribe hormones or puberty&#8208;blocking medication. Other states like Tennessee have proposed bills that would prohibit public school libraries from having materials considered harmful to minors. These are just a few examples of how responses to the culture war are being baked into state policies. There is little uncertainty about the positions that Connecticut and Oklahoma will take on these issues.</p><p>Looking at the decade ahead, we speculate that state contexts will continue to polarize unabated and that some of the most active policy areas will include (1) voting rights and electoral policies and (2) reproductive and civil rights policies. These issues may be a &#8220;final frontier&#8221; in the decades&#8208;long transformation of the state policy landscape. Their consequences are likely to cement the diverging trajectories in states&#8217; democratic performance and the life and death experiences of their populations.</p><p>The effects on democratic institutions are already visible.

</p><p>We are not proposing that all research to explain health disparities across US states should investigate only macrolevel factors. Instead, we are underscoring the importance of (1) focusing on actionable macrolevel factors, and (2) interpreting research on more proximal factors in light of the structural forces that made them relevant for health. We refer to the second item as multilevel interpretation. It is essential yet often lacking in published studies. For example, a study lacking a multilevel interpretation might conclude that a state like Mississippi has lower levels of life expectancy because its population is less educated and has a higher share of Black residents. However, as an explanation, it is inadequate and unactionable because it neglects the reasons why education and race matter in states like Mississippi. Consequently, it risks being misinterpreted by policymakers and the public as implying that life expectancy disparities across states are inevitable, unmalleable, and simply a matter of demographics or &#8220;bad choices&#8221; or &#8220;bad behaviors&#8221; among their residents. In contrast, a multilevel interpretation would connect the dots. It would explain how structural forces made education and race relevant for health in Mississippi through public schooling expenditures, minimum wage levels, structural racism embedded in certain policies and other conditions in the states, and more.</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0100"><title>Commercial and Legal Determinants of Health</title><p>The NASEM framework also drew attention to corporations as a key macrolevel factor in shaping population health.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> there has been a paucity of research examining their role in the large and growing disparities in health across states. In our view, this is a serious omission in the literature and addressing it should be paramount.</p><p>A formidable obstacle to addressing this omission is the challenge of collecting disparate sources of data on the multifaceted and sometimes subterranean political activities of corporations and interest groups that influence state policies, and ultimately health outcomes. This would be a major undertaking. Although there are various data sources that cover transparent &#8220;hard money&#8221; campaign contributions and lobbying spending (e.g., the Center for Responsive Politics), many important political tactics of corporations and the wealthy&#8212;including organization building, media influence, the subsidization of &#8220;astroturf&#8221; movements,<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">

It would be difficult but not insurmountable. The scientific community has undertaken other daunting data collection efforts (e.g., collecting blood samples from thousands of people in national data sets like the Health and Retirement Study) and could marshal its ingenuity to do the same here. This effort will require sustained funding from sources such as the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. We implore funders to facilitate and support the creation of this data and its linkage with individual&#8208;level survey data sets. In sum, the next generation of research on the large and growing disparities in health across states, as well as the troubling trends in health at the national level, must elevate a focus on corporations and their interest groups.</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0110"><title>Policy Amplification and Attenuation</title><p>State policy contexts are important for population health, but local and national contexts also matter. It is imperative that research begins to examine how these contexts &#8220;combine&#8221; to affect population health. These contexts may have synergistic or offsetting effects on population health, but research on such effects is scant. In fact, two new studies find that state policy contexts may be more consequential for population health in certain types of local environments. One shows that state contexts may be especially important in nonmetropolitan areas&#8212;the areas in which working&#8208;age mortality rates have increased in recent decades.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">

Conventional econometric approaches to quantifying the effects of state policies on health generally attempt to isolate the effect of a single policy. However, bundling makes isolating the effects of specific policies challenging. For example, in 2019, the correlation across states between the number of firearm laws and amount of tobacco tax on a pack of cigarettes was 0.71; the correlation between minimum wage levels and Medicaid generosity was 0.61; and 21 of the 23 states without right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws had a minimum wage above the federal level while just 8 of the 27 states with such laws had a minimum wage above the federal level.</p><p>Another complication of the single&#8208;policy approach is that policies can be enacted around the same time. Take, for example, the year 2014, when 25 states implemented Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act,<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Importantly, 11 states implemented all three policy changes that year and another 11 states implemented two changes, greatly complicating efforts to understand the effect of any single policy.</p><p>A better understanding of the large and growing health disparities across states requires new approaches that examine policy bundles. Examining bundles is also consistent with &#8220;the reality that people live more than one policy at a time.&#8221;<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0075" ref-type="bibr">

No single policy can explain the growing disparities in population health across states. Returning to our Connecticut and Oklahoma comparison, life expectancy in these two states diverged after 1980 not because Connecticut raised its minimum wage, or increased cigarette taxes, or enacted firearm safety policies, or expanded Medicaid, or any other single policy change. Instead, we must look for answers in the bundling of such changes</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0130"><title>Communication and Impact</title><p>Much has been written about how to effectively communicate with policymakers and the public, so we share two recommendations that we took from a recent meeting with state policymakers. At the meeting, we shared our finding that changing state policies could increase or decrease life expectancy by several years, and that trends in states&#8217; policies had contributed to the troubling trends in US life expectancy.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> Our excitement about the findings was not shared by the group, and, after some probing, we discovered why: life expectancy was not as compelling of a measure as we considered it to be. However, interest suddenly piqued once we explained that the gap in life expectancy between Mississippi and Hawaii (75 versus 82 years) in 2019 did not mean that 75&#8208;year&#8208;old people got 7 more years of life if they resided in Hawaii; it meant that Mississippians were dying young. Explaining that, for every 100 babies born in Hawaii in 2019, 14 would likely die before their 65<sup>th</sup> birthday but for every 100 born in Mississippi, 24 would die before their 65<sup>th</sup> birthday, was more compelling to policymakers than a 7&#8208;year gap in life expectancy between the states. The implication is that researchers should better understand the types of information that policymakers and the public find compelling. Some may be motivated by information about how to live a long life while others may be compelled by information on how to avoid dying young.</p><p>Our second recommendation is for researchers to bear in mind that there is considerable variation among policymakers and the public about whether the pursuit of good health and long lives should take priority in all decisions. Communicating research results in a manner that endorses a &#8220;health at all costs&#8221; approach is unlikely to be compelling to many policymakers and the public, as seen during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> It fails to recognize that policymakers must balance budgets and many critical priorities and that a &#8220;health at all costs&#8221; lifestyle may not be desirable for many Americans. During our meeting with state policymakers, one shared a baseball analogy that colorfully illustrated this point: they stated that their constituents want to run around the bases (i.e., life) at the pace they preferred and slide into home base (i.e., die) as soft or as hard as they want. Public reaction to COVID&#8208;19 mitigation policies, such as mask mandates and stay&#8208;at&#8208;home orders, in large swaths of the country echo this sentiment. It is an important lesson for population health researchers and practitioners. A key implication is that population health research may have a greater impact and change minds if that research, or at least the communication of the research, considers health to be one of several critical priorities of policymakers and the public.</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0140"><title>State Policy Priorities</title><p>We conclude with two overarching policy priorities for the next decade. We selected these two because they have profound implications for population health and well&#8208;being and because states have been and continue to be moving in opposite directions in these priorities. One priority is to ensure that all individuals have adequate opportunities for economic security. State policymakers have numerous ways to achieve this priority; we highlight seven of them here. One way is <italic toggle="yes">raising the minimum wage</italic> to at least keep up with inflation. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is worth 14.8% less than it was in 2009 (the last year the wage was raised) and 28.6% less than it was in 1968.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0083" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>83</sup>
</xref> By one estimate, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would benefit nearly 40 million workers, raising many of them and their families out of poverty and its deleterious impacts.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0083" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>83</sup>
</xref> Another state&#8208;level economic policy with spillover benefits on the health of workers and their families is the <italic toggle="yes">EITC</italic>. While states like New York and Minnesota offer a refundable EITC, states like Idaho and Tennessee offer no EITC at all. Another priority is to halt the destruction of unions by, for example, eliminating so&#8208;called <italic toggle="yes">right&#8208;to&#8208;work laws</italic>, which could lift the economic boats of working individuals, their families, and surrounding communities. <italic toggle="yes">Paid sick and family leave</italic> laws and <italic toggle="yes">robust child care supports</italic> can help individuals remain in the labor force while caring for young children and aging parents. <italic toggle="yes">Taxation structures</italic> are also critical. In their book <italic toggle="yes">Taxing the Poor</italic>, Newman and O'Brien write, &#8220;Virtually everything that matters in determining the life chances of Americans&#8217; children is affected by how their families are taxed.&#8221;<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0084" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>84</sup>
</xref> Focusing on state and local taxes, they showed that progressive tax structures that allow deductions and credits that disproportionately benefit poor individuals (e.g., renter's credits, EITC, child tax credits, subsidies for utility bills), and that emphasize property taxes over sales taxes as revenue, lead to a host of societal benefits such as lower teenage pregnancy rates, lower crime rates, higher educational attainment, and lower mortality rates. The sixth policy that we emphasize for achieving adequate opportunities for economic security for all individuals is to ensure <italic toggle="yes">access to abortion</italic>, as doing so can significantly reduce the risks of poverty among women and children.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0085" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>85</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="milq12617-bib-0086" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>86</sup>
</xref> Our final recommendation under this policy priority is for state and local governments to <italic toggle="yes">invest in public schooling</italic>. This is essential for giving individuals the skills needed to thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>A second overarching policy priority is to deter behaviors that injure and kill hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. Behaviors such as cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, reckless driving, and unsafe firearm use not only injure and kill the people who engage in them; they also harm and kill people who do not, and they impose significant financial costs on the government, employers, and taxpayers. For instance, each year cigarette smoking costs roughly $170 billion in health care costs<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0087" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>87</sup>
</xref> and more than $185 billion in productivity losses.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0088" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>88</sup>
</xref> Also staggering are the health care and economic costs of firearm injuries, fatalities, and their collateral consequences for families and communities.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0089" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>89</sup>
</xref> State policymakers have many means to deter these behaviors such as raising tobacco and alcohol excise taxes, mandating indoor clean air laws, and bolstering firearm safety laws. States differ dramatically in their approaches to these behaviors. For instance, state excise taxes on cigarettes are an effective way to reduce smoking prevalence and smoking&#8208;related deaths, yet, in 2022, taxes on a pack of cigarettes ranged from a mere 17 cents in Missouri to $4.35 in New York and Connecticut.<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0090" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>90</sup>
</xref> Likewise, firearm safety laws differ markedly across the country, despite evidence that they can significantly reduce firearm homicides. Three laws that appear to be particularly powerful are mandatory handgun waiting periods,<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0091" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>91</sup>
</xref> laws that restrict possession of firearms by intimate partner violence offenders,<xref rid="milq12617-bib-0092" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Under current political conditions, these policy priorities are unlikely to be addressed at sufficient scale to make substantial improvements in population health. We thus turn here to additional policies and organizational strategies that can increase political capacity toward improving economic security and the regulation of firearms, environmental quality, tobacco, and alcohol.</p><p>A first strategy is to pursue institutional reforms that ensure that state policymaking reflects the votes and will of the people in each state. State governments hold constitutional authority over voting rights, election certification, and legislative districting. Over the past two decades, some states have created new burdens and obstacles to voting, as well as drawn legislative district maps (for state legislative and US House seats) that have set records in terms of their partisan bias. This state&#8208;level weakening of democracy has contributed to recent policy changes that are &#8220;out of step&#8221; with states&#8217; voters, such as legal bans on abortion.</p><p>Policymakers at both the state and national levels can achieve this priority. At the state level, research shows that initiatives such as automatic voter registration, offering early voting, removing felony disenfranchisement laws, and establishing bipartisan commissions to draw fair legislative maps can improve the relationship between popular preferences and state policy. Ensuring that the will of voters is actually reflected in the states&#8217; policy contexts will also require efforts such as banning partisan gerrymandering, preventing the disproportionate influence of corporations and their lobbying groups n state policymaking, and discontinuing the use of preemption laws to block local areas&#8217; ability to improve the health and well&#8208;being of their residents. Perhaps more important, Congress can set new rules at the national level that set baseline democratic standards across states, as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did. A national ban on partisan gerrymandering, as well as national automatic voter registration, would go far in preventing further democratic backsliding in the states.</p><p>Finally, an additional strategy to build capacity in support of policies to improve health is to reinvest in the American labor movement. Since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, labor unions have played a key role in nearly every expansion of economic security (including policies expanding access to health care) and civil rights in the United States. However, labor union membership has been in steep decline since the 1970s due to increased employer opposition and state&#8208;level policies that restrict labor organizing. Today, labor unions are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, and they offer a potential long&#8208;term mechanism for building the political capacity of ordinary workers and ultimately for implementing policies that improve the health of the American public.</p></sec></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0150"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The polarization in states&#8217; policy contexts continues unabated, is fueled by a few interlocking forces, and has had life&#8208;and&#8208;death consequences for millions of Americans. Those forces must be a focus of future research on the increasingly poor performance of the country in population health. Nevertheless, research alone is insufficient. It must be matched with smart policy choices and communication strategies that resonate with the values and constraints of all stakeholders.</p></sec><sec id="milq12617-sec-0160"><p>
