Several possible explanations for lower cancer survival, among those with SMI, have been suggested, including: delayed help-seeking, difficulties in communication and poorer adherence to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Although only contributing to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes in individuals with a diagnosis of bowel, breast or cervical cancer, it has been proposed that lower screening participation, by people with SMI, may partially explain their higher rates of premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent research by Public Health England (PHE) supports this hypothesis, and reports that people with SMI are considerably less likely to participate in all three cancer screening programmes, with people with SMI being 18% less likely to participate in breast screening, 20% less likely to participate in cervical screening, and 31% less likely to participate in bowel screening (compared to people without SMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">While valuable, PHE&#8217;s analysis did not differentiate between SMI conditions (such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), and did not explore variation among those with SMI by sociodemographic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As such, it is not known whether specific SMIs are associated with lower participation in individual cancer screening programmes, nor whether inequalities are exacerbated by known correlates of screening participation, such as age, sex and deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], some of which (e.g. Black or Minority Ethnic group, deprivation, smoking) are also associated with higher prevalence of SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Greater understanding would enable better targeting of public health interventions and support for this vulnerable group, and may help to reduce the health inequalities experienced by them.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par8">The aims of this study were to: (1) verify whether inequalities in cancer screening participation, reported by PHE, persist after controlling for additional factors, which are known to be associated with screening participation, (2) test for possible associations between specific SMIs (such as schizophrenia and bipolar) and breast, bowel and cervical screening participation and (3) identify subgroups of individuals (with SMI) who are least likely to participate in screening (with a view of informing targeted strategies to promote participation within these groups).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting/context</title><p id="Par9">The National Health Service in England offers free, universal screening for the early detection of breast, bowel and cervical cancers. Bowel cancer screening is offered once every two years (for men and women, aged between 60 and 74 years), breast cancer screening once every three years (for women, between the ages of 50 and 73) and cervical screening once every three and a half years (for women between the ages of 25 and 49), or once every five years (for women between the ages of 50 and 64), depending on age.</p><p id="Par10">During the study period (defined below), guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) screening was the main bowel cancer screening method used (gFOBT was used up until June 2019, after which it was replaced with the faecal immunochemical test), mammography was offered for breast screening, and microscopic examination of cervical smears (i.e. &#8216;Pap smears&#8217;) were primarily offered for cervical screening (up until December 2019, when microscopic examination was replaced with primary Human Papilloma Virus [HPV] testing of cervical smears). gFOBT and FIT require the patient to collect and provide sample from one or more bowel motions, which can later be tested for blood. Cervical smears and primary HPV testing, meanwhile, involve the collection of cells, from the lining of the cervix, and is performed by a primary care nurse, using a speculum and swab. Mammography, finally, comprises an X-ray of the breasts, and is performed by a radiographer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par11">To test the associations between SMI status (i.e. SMI, no SMI) and SMI condition (i.e. schizophrenia, other psychoses, bipolar disorder, no SMI) with cancer screening participation, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of adults who were registered with a general practice, in England, contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study dataset</title><p id="Par12">CPRD is a database comprised of medical records from patients registered at over 1000 General Practices in England. As of 2017, CPRD included 13% of England&#8217;s population, and was reported to be &#8220;broadly representative of the general population, with respect to deprivation, age and gender&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The database is continuously updated and provides a reliable dataset to identify both cancer screening participation and SMI status (the latter is not available within routine national cancer screening programme databases). For the purposes of this study, data from 1987, to September 2020, were available to us. As individuals within the CPRD dataset are assigned a new patient ID each time they register with a new practice, individuals&#8217; participation in the most recent screening round, only, was assessed (this was to avoid double counting and ensure the reliability and validity of the data). The actual time period of the analysis varied according to the type of screening being assessed (bowel, breast, or cervical), as each has a different interval length and eligibility criteria (see below).</p><p id="Par13">For bowel screening, the analytic period was March 2017&#8211;September 2020 (the screening interval [two years], plus six months leeway to allow for rescheduling of appointments, reminders, etc.). For breast screening, the analytic period was March 2016&#8211;September 2020 (the screening interval [three yeas], plus 6 months leeway). Finally, for cervical screening, the analytic period was March 2016&#8211;September 2020 for women aged 25&#8211;49 (the screening interval [three and a half years], plus six months leeway), and March 2014&#8211;September 2020 for women aged 50&#8211;64 years (the screening interval [three and a half years], plus six months leeway). These are the groups who were eligible for the screening programmes as of September 2020, when data were first obtained. The dates were agreed by all members of the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p id="Par14">Participation in bowel, breast and cervical cancer screening programmes comprised the primary outcomes for this study. Participation was assessed using SNOMED (a structured clinical vocabulary for use in electronic health records) and Read codes (a clinical terminology system that was in widespread use in General Practice in England until 2018, when NHS England switched to using SNOMED codes). A patient was considered to have participated in a cancer screening programme if they were eligible for that programme (based on age and gender) and had a record of participating in that screening, within the recommended time period, running up to 1 September 2020, either from the Quality Outcomes Framework (version 45) expanded cluster list (SNOMED), the Primary Care Domain Reference Sets (SNOMED), or the NHS Code Browser (Read) (a list of the SNOMED and READ codes used in this research is provided in Appendix&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Primary exposure</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>SMI status and condition</title><p id="Par15">Each patient was assigned an SMI status and SMI group by the research team. SMI status was binary (SMI, no SMI), while SMI group was categorical, and comprised four groups; namely: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, other psychoses (which included a range of psychotic conditions, some of which may be reflective of the individual&#8217;s stage within the diagnostic pathway [e.g. paranoid states], and some individuals being assigned to other SMI groups at a later stage [N.B. Non-SMI-related forms of psychosis, such as dementia, and drug and alcohol induced psychosis, were not included]) and no SMI (see Appendix&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for an overview of the Read and SNOMED codes comprising the SMI groups). SMI was defined as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (excluding organic and substance induced psychotic disorders). The approach used to define SMI is relatively common and consistent with other work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and is similar to the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) mental health register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on study outcomes for the cohort based on QOF or the amended SMI definition.</p><p id="Par16">As SMI diagnosis can take some time from symptomatic presentation, no time restrictions were applied to SMI diagnosis. In other words, individuals with all diagnoses, which were not recorded as resolved, within the dataset, as of September 2020, were included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Explanatory variables&#8212;demographics</title><p id="Par17">To adjust for the effects of known correlates of screening participation, several demographic variables were extracted for inclusion in the analysis:</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Age</title><p id="Par18">Age was determined by subtracting the patient&#8217;s year of birth (available on the CPRD database) from the year at which data were extracted and analysed: 2020. To determine whether inequalities exist for specific age groups, each patient was then assigned an &#8216;age&#8217; category&#8217;. Each age category comprised a five year period (e.g. 60&#8211;64), so as to ensure category had a sufficient number of patients available for statistical comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sex</title><p id="Par19">Sex was binary and extracted and coded as either male or female.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethnicity</title><p id="Par20">Ethnicity was identified using SNOMED and READ codes, and categorised based on records in CPRD and Census groupings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]: Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Any other Asian background), Black (Caribbean, African, Any other Black, Black British or Caribbean background), Mixed (White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, White and Asian, Any other Mixed or multiple ethnic background), White (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British, Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller, Roma, Any other White background), Other (Arab, Any other ethnic group) or not recorded (including prefer not to say/unknown). Where a patient had more than one record of observed ethnicity, the most recent observation was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Area-level deprivation</title><p id="Par21">Area-level deprivation was derived from each person&#8217;s postcode, using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD): the government&#8217;s official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It uses administrative data and census-derived indicators of income, education, employment, living environment, health and disability, barriers to housing and services and crime at small-area level to allocate areas a deprivation score. CPRD sorts areas into quintiles of deprivation and assigns quintiles as 1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived). Where IMD based on patient&#8217;s postcode was not available, GP practice IMD was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Region</title><p id="Par22">The address of each person&#8217;s GP was converted into one of (then) ten Strategic Health Authorities within England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], namely: Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, South West, South Central, London and South East Coast.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Explanatory variables&#8212;lifestyle risk factors</title><p id="Par23">In addition to demographic factors associated with screening participation, several lifestyle risk factors, known to be associated with screening participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and known to be more prevalent among people with SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], were also extracted for inclusion in the analysis.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Smoking status</title><p id="Par24">A patient&#8217;s current smoking status was identified with SNOMED concept ID codes within the Primary Care Domain reference set cluster ID &#8216;LSMOK_COD&#8217;/ PCD_Refset_ID &#8216;999004211000230104&#8217;.

In addition, patients who were not registered at their current GP at the start of the period under observation were removed from the population sample, before analysis was initiated. This was because it was not known if they participated in screening within the recommended time period, before joining their current GP. Previous analysis by PHE shows a similar proportion of SMI and non-SMI patients are excluded based on GP registration date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and, therefore, the impact on the study outcomes is likely to be negligible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par27">Descriptive statistics were used to report breast, bowel and cervical screening participation by SMI status, SMI group and demographic and lifestyle strata for SMI status (i.e. age, sex, ethnicity, area-level deprivation, region, smoking status and BMI). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were then used to test for associations between SMI status and SMI group with bowel, breast and cervical screening participation (before and after adjusting for co-variates). Finally, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to test for subgroup differences in bowel, breast and cervical screening participation by SMI status. Analyses of subgroup differences in bowel, breast and cervical screening participation by SMI group were not conducted as the number of participants would be too small for conclusions to be made for individual conditions. The threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05.

This study adds to current knowledge, showing that participation is lowest for people with schizophrenia, followed by people with other psychoses and people with bipolar disorder.</p><p id="Par46">Importantly, this study shows that inequalities in participation, between those with and without SMI, persist across sociodemographic subgroups, such as age and sex, and are exacerbated by several key characteristics. Specifically, inequalities in participation, between people with and without SMI, increased with age for breast cancer screening, while for bowel and cervical screening, inequalities increased with area-level deprivation (it should be noted that, as deprivation increases, the proportion of the population that have SMI also increases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">When considering variation by ethnicity, it was found that adults with SMI, who were of an ethnic minority group, had lower participation than their White counterparts. Adults with SMI from Black ethnic groups had the lowest participation in bowel and breast screening, while female adults with SMI, from Asian ethnic groups, had the lowest participation in cervical screening. The widest gaps in participation, between people with and without SMI, however, were observed in the White population. Despite this, adults of an ethnic minority background were often less likely to participate in screening if they did not have SMI, than White adults with SMI, highlighting the width of the gap in screening participation between those of a White and non-White ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p id="Par48">The findings of this research are consistent with a previous study by PHE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as well as a recent meta-analysis of global studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], both of which found participation in cancer screening programmes to be lower among people with SMI. The present study builds upon these studies&#8217; findings, however, by highlighting that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses are differentially associated with screening participation, and that screening participation is lowest among people with schizophrenia. Our study also builds upon these studies&#8217; findings by highlighting that inequalities in participation, between people with and without SMI, exist across all sociodemographic strata, are exacerbated by age (breast) and area-level deprivation (bowel and cervical), and are independent of IMD and ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Our findings are also consistent with previous studies documenting lower screening participation in London (observed even after adjusting for population characteristics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As speculated by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the increased mobility of people in London may artificially lower the observed participation for this region (through a greater number of invitations being sent to out of date addresses).</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Implications for policy and future research</title><p id="Par50">The results of this study have implications for future research. Specifically, they highlight the need for qualitative research to better understand why people with SMI (particularly those from an ethnic minority background, or who live in socioeconomically deprived areas) are less likely to participate in all three cancer screening programmes. Such research is needed to support the development and co-production of interventions to address the intrapersonal, individual-level and organisational barriers to screening experienced by these groups (previous qualitative research has been conducted in the UK, but has not focussed on ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups with the lowest participation, specifically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). In addition, further research, focussing on GP visits, may provide further insights into why people with SMI are diagnosed at a later stage, and possible opportunities for early diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">The results of this study also have implications for policy. Indeed, they support the NHS Long Term Plan, which set the ambition to increase access to annual physical health checks, for adults with SMI, with the aim of 390,000 people receiving physical health checks by 2023/2024 (access to national screening programmes is outlined as an additional element of this comprehensive annual health assessment, and provides an opportunity for intervention and support to improve screening access for this group [for example, by allowing staff to identify any &#8216;reasonable adjustments&#8217; that the patient may require, in order to participate in screening, such as the need for a separate waiting area, by using a decisional conflict aid, as has been done for cervical screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. They also support the NHS Core 20PLUS5 initiative (an approach to reducing health inequalities), which describes five focus clinical areas requiring accelerated improvement, including the most deprived 20% of the national population (as identified by the national IMD), ethnic minority communities, SMI and early cancer diagnosis (i.e. by highlighting the need for improved cancer screening across these clinical areas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The results also highlight the need for specific action to support people with schizophrenia, as well as the need for extra support for people with SMI living in socioeconomically deprived and/or ethnically diverse areas (people with SMI in these areas are the least likely to participate in screening, and the prevalence of SMI in these areas is also greatest, as is premature mortality in people with SMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This is particularly true for those who smoke and have an elevated BMI, as both characteristics are associated with increased cancer incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Finally, the results support the need for routine data linkage to allow analysis (and monitoring of inequalities) to be carried out as routine, rather than having to rely on sample data, such as CPRD. This could build on the success and expansion of the Health and Care of People with Learning Disabilities collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], where population with SMI are currently flagged as a comparator group, but reporting of health outcomes (including cancer screening participation) for SMI cohort is not carried out.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par54">This study has several strengths. First, the sample size was large, with over 1.7 million, 1.3 million and 2.5 million participants included in the breast, bowel and cervical screening analyses, respectively. Second, it used objective measures of screening participation (as opposed to self-reported measures), improving the validity of the findings. Finally, the effects of a wide range of known factors were included in the multivariate analysis, minimising the risk that the associations observed were due to external factors.</p><p id="Par55">This study also has several limitations. First, it was restricted to data available within CPRD, meaning that it was not possible to include psychological variables (such as perceived risk of cancer)/additional demographic factors (such as employment status and educational attainment), or identify populations no longer residing at their home address (such as those in contact with the justice system), both of which are known to affect participation in screening. Second, adults with SMI, who are inpatients in mental health hospitals, for 6 months or more, are removed from the GP register and, therefore, were not included in our analysis (our study may, consequently, underestimate inequalities; further research exploring cancer screening use in these individuals would be valuable, given that SMI severity has been linked with participation, and those not registered with a GP do not receive screening invitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]). Third, the study period includes the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so overall participation may be lower because of this, and inequalities in participation exacerbated. Fourth, at the point of data extraction, no method for identifying transgender adults, within CPRD, had been described, and so it was not possible for us to explore whether inequalities disproportionately affect this population (such methods have since been described, and should be employed in future analyses [Trans men (assigned female at birth) do not receive invitations if registered as male with their GP, but are still entitled to screening if they have a cervix]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Fifth, an area-level and composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation was used, meaning that it was not possible to determine which specific aspects of socioeconomic deprivation (e.g. housing, education, employment, etc.) are most likely to impact on people with SMI (this also does not account for the way an individual experiences socioeconomic deprivation within the area they live; further research is needed to address this). Finally, this study only examined participation during a single round of screening. As such, it is not clear to what extent patterns in participation (i.e. regular participation, partial participation and regular non-participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]) vary between people with and without SMI. Given that these patterns have been shown to be associated with bowel cancer outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], further research, investigating these, would be valuable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">This study highlights the complexity of inequality in participation in cancer screening, within and between populations with and without SMI. It confirms that participation is lower in those with SMI and highlights it is particularly low among those with schizophrenia, those living in the most deprived areas (with SMI), and those of a Black or Asian ethnicity. The results, consequently, indicate which conditions and population groups should receive extra support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec38"><p>
