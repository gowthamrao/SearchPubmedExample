Here, we used a mouse model to investigate the antitumor effect of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) dual blockade on metastatic brain tumors and evaluated immune responses during treatment. After establishing hematogenous brain metastasis by transplanting murine bladder carcinoma MBT2 cells stably expressing secNLuc reporter via the internal carotid artery of C3H/HeNCrl mice, we observed the formation of metastases not only in the brain parenchyma but also in the ventricles. The observed pathological areas showed that metastases in the ventricle were histologically larger than that in the brain parenchyma. Regarding the total tumor burden in the whole brain as revealed by Nluc activities, the combination of anti-PD-L1 antibody and anti-VEGF antibody showed a stronger anti-tumor effect than each single agent. Anti-PD-L1 antibody alone enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming in regional lymph nodes, increased the proportion of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in whole brain, and increased the density of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, anti-VEGF antibody alone decreased microvessel density (MVD) in ventricular metastases, and the combination treatment increased intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> cell density in the brain parenchyma and ventricular metastases. These results suggest that PD-L1 blockade enhanced cancer immunity not only in brain metastases lesions but also in the regional lymph nodes of the metastases, and that the addition of VEGF blockade increased the antitumor effect by increasing the infiltration of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and decreasing MVD.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10585-024-10309-y.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-PD-L1 antibody</kwd><kwd>Anti-VEGF antibody</kwd><kwd>Hematogenous brain metastasis model</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature B.V. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par20">Brain metastases are a common complication of solid tumors and a leading cause of neurologic impairments and death in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most frequent intracranial metastatic site is the brain parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Surgical resection and radiation therapy are used for local control of brain metastases, but their therapeutic effects are limited. Therefore, more effective pharmacological intervention treatments are eagerly awaited.</p><p id="Par21">Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and is a primary ligand for an immune checkpoint molecule programmed death-1 (PD-1). Anti-PD-L1 antibody inhibits the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 on T cells in lymph nodes and tumors and releases T cell suppression, and thus promotes the proliferation and activation leading to anti-tumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the key angiogenic factors in tumors and participates in the initial stage of tumor development, progression, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Anti-VEGF antibody targets VEGF, causing the shrinkage of existing tumor blood vessels and the inhibition of angiogenesis demonstrating anti-tumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to quantitative changes in blood vessels, various positive effects on tumor immunity have also been reported, such as the maturation of dendritic cells (DC), the promotion of T cell infiltration into tumors, and the inhibition of regulatory T (Treg) cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) by anti-VEGF antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These effects provide the rationale for its combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).</p><p id="Par23">Indeed, treatment regimens including combinations of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and VEGF antibodies have been approved for use in clinical settings for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, many clinical trials are currently underway, making it one of the most promising combinations in cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The effect of ICIs on metastatic tumors, including brain metastasis and their mechanisms, remains poorly understood. Firstly, the presence of the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier (BBB), which restricts the transport of substances to the brain, is thought to potentially limit the penetration of systemic therapeutic drugs. However, recent reports have shown that the BBB changes to the Blood&#8211;Tumor Barrier (BTB) during the development of primary or metastatic brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Secondly, the semi-privileged immune environment created by the BTB may limit the infiltration and maintenance of immune cells in the microenvironment of brain metastasis. Recent single-cell based integrative analysis of transcriptomics and genetics have characterized the tumor immune microenvironment of brain metastases, and there are increasing reports of immune cell infiltration in brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, there is limited evidence showing that immune cells infiltrating brain metastases are directly involved in the shrinkage of brain metastases following treatment with ICIs. It is important to confirm the above mechanism using an appropriate model, and there are variety of reported brain metastasis models. Of these, the hematogenous model, which is improved by the intracarotid inoculation of tumor cells, is known to recapitulate the later steps in tumor brain metastasis, e.g., adhesion to the brain vasulature, extravasation, and outgrowth in a brain-specific environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our prior research, we developed a stable model that enables to assess drug efficacy by transplanting human tumor cell lines into the internal carotid artery of immunodeficient mice, which formed cerebral metastases. We showed that systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies penetrate these brain metastatic lesions and exert anti-tumor activity, accompanied by a decrease in tumor microvessel density (MVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, we modified this model using an adoptive immunization approach, transferring immune cells from human cell line-immunized mice to immunodeficient mice with established cerebral metastases. We demonstrated that the transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrate the brain metastases, and that the systemic administration of anti-PD-L1 antibodies promotes the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, significantly enhancing the anti-tumor effect against brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In the present study, we used immune-competent mice with the aim of deeply and precisely analyzing the anti-tumor immunity against brain metastases. We formed brain metastases by transplanting syngeneic mouse tumor cells via the internal carotid artery, elucidated the antitumor efficacy of the combined use of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF antibodies on established brain metastases in immune-competent mice, and performed an examination of the immune cells within the brain metastases and the associated lymph nodes, as well as an assessment of the tumor blood vessel density.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p id="Par26">Monoclonal murine anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF antibodies were provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA, USA).

Although the brain metastasis model established here is based on a single cell line, and further research is needed to enhance the generalizability of the findings, this model allows for the precise evaluation of the anti-tumor activities of ICIs, alone or in combination. Furthermore, we successfully elucidated their modes of action. In the evaluation of total tumor burden in the brain, which was assessed based on whole brain Nluc activity, the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF showed stronger anti-tumor activity than each antibody alone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In this model, metastases were observed not only in the brain parenchyma but also in the ventricles. Upon conducting a histopathological examination of the brain metastatic lesions, we found that the ventricular metastases were histologically larger than those in the brain parenchyma (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The luciferase activity measured in the whole brain represents the sum of all metastatic foci; therefore, tumor lesions of the ventricles were thought to contribute more than those of the parenchyma to the total tumor burden and to its differences from the other treatment groups. Since brain metastases are usually parenchymal and metastases in the brain ventricles are rare in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], we attempted to evaluate the antitumor effect of the drug on metastatic lesions in the brain parenchyma and ventricle separately, but it was technically impossible to isolate each tumor lesion from the whole brain. However, as discussed in detail below, since the combined use of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF resulted in an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells&#8212;which are generally responsible for cytotoxicity against tumor cells&#8212;compared to control, IHC analysis suggested that the potential for anti-tumor activity was increased in both ventricular and parenchymal tumor lesions.</p><p id="Par58">The effect of each antibody and the combination on immune cells was analyzed using two methods, FCM and IHC, with separate aims. Firstly, similar to tumor burden, FCM analysis was conducted for whole brain cell suspension, which includes not only tumor cells, but other cells derived from brain tissues with a variable recovery rate due to aggregation. Therefore, we focused on the proportion of activated cells among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. We were able to confirm the enhancement of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and NK cell activation by anti-PD-L1 alone and/or in combination with anti-VEGF in brain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, d). Secondly, through the IHC staining of pathological sections, we were able to analyze the density of both CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells using this method. The ventricles and parenchyma of the tumor were analyzed separately. In the ventricles, an increase in the density of both CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the group treated with a combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF compared to control (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In the brain parenchyma, an increase in the density of both CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells was also observed in the group treated with a combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF compared to control (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). In studies using subcutaneously transplanted tumors, it has been shown that the combined blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 axis and VEGF induces an increase in the infiltration of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into the tumor either through an increase in the expression of T cell migration factor CXCR3 ligands within the tumor, or through an increase or decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules or FasL, respectively, on vascular endothelial cells in tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In this model, PD-L1 monotherapy did not reach a level where a significant difference could be detected, but the combined use of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF consistently showed a significant increase in the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells in the ventricles and brain parenchyma metastases (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, c). This suggests the possibility that the anti-VEGF treatment promotes the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by anti-PD-L1 into the tumor by enhancing the expression of vascular endothelial adhesion molecules and through the production of chemokines, also in the metastatic brain tumor.&#160;Further research will be required to understand the detailed mechanism for why the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells increased in the brain metastasis model.</p><p id="Par59">In addition, not only CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and NK cell activation, but also the enhancement of Thconv cell activation was observed with anti-PD-L1 alone or in combination with anti-VEGF (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f).</p><p id="Par60">Regarding Treg cells, most Treg cells were in activated status even in the control group. The ratio of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> among Treg cells was also high and there was no change observed with antibody treatments (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). Since it ultimately leads to an increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, our results suggested that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation overcame the suppressive effect of Treg cells, if any, in the current model. Although previous reports show that anti-VEGF inhibits the proliferation of Treg and reduces intratumoral Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], in the current model, the anti-VEGF antibody did not change the ratio of Ki67<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). The difference may be due to the characteristics of the particular model used, such as the tumor cell line or the site of the tumor, but further studies will be needed to clarify the effect of VEGF blockade on Treg proliferation and its suppressive effects. On the other hand, we speculated that it might further enhance the antitumor effect in combination with anti-PD-L1 alone or the anti-PD-L1/anti-VEGF combo if we could achieve the depletion and/or suppression of Treg cells using other agents in this hematogenous brain metastasis model.</p><p id="Par61">In the current study, the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Thconv cells, as well as an increase in the percentage of activated DCs in live cells, were observed in the CLNs, reported to be draining lymph nodes of brain metastatic tumors, following anti-PD-L1 administration alone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, d, g). In studies using subcutaneously transplanted tumors, even in tumor models with low PD-L1 expression, it has been shown that blocking PD-L1 expressed on DCs in the lymph nodes promotes the priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and induces significant anti-tumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the current model, PD-L1 is expressed on DCs in lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), and it is thought that blocking PD-L1 expressed on DCs in the lymph nodes with antibodies could promote priming and enhance anti-tumor activity. In our previous study, in which activated immune cells were transferred to immunodeficient mice with brain metastases, the enhanced anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 was suggested to be due to the intratumoral activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Here, as we expected, using this immunocompetent model, we showed that anti-PD-L1 can activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells both in the metastatic tumor lesion in brain and its tumor-draining lymph&#160;nodes, suggesting that the cancer immunity cycle, including the affiliated lymph nodes, is functioning also in metastatic brain tumors. Hung et al. reported that the therapeutic effect of the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibody was correlated with both increased effector T cell function and downregulation of suppressive Tregs and tumor-infiltrating DCs using the intracranial injection of murine glioblastoma GL261 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Although Taggart et al., using a mouse model of brain metastasis established by intracranial injection of melanoma cells, reported that the presence of subcutaneously transplanted extracranial tumors and the activation/release of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were required for the anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination to exert its therapeutic effect on intracranial tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], in our model we did not visually detect any extracranial lesions after the intra-carotid artery injection of MBT2 cells. Although there are differences in the models, extracranial tumors are probably unnecessary in this hematogenous brain metastasis model, and the cancer immunity cycle is functioning, including through brain metastases and priming in the regional lymph nodes of the metastases, leading to antitumor effect.</p><p id="Par62">Regarding tumor vascular density, a decrease in tumor microvascular density was detected in the ventricles with the anti-VEGF antibody (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), and we speculated that the anti-tumor effect is enhanced through both the anti-PD-L1 combination-induced increase in the number of immune cells and the anti-angiogenic effect. On the other hand, although no lesions that could be analyzed for MVD were recognized in the brain parenchyma in this model (data not shown), we have confirmed anti-VEGF antibody&#8217;s intratumoral penetration in hematogenous models, which worked well in reducing MVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Based on the results of the phase III IMpower150 study comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (ABCP) or atezolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (ACP) to bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (BCP), ABCP has become a standard-of-care regimen and is approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC without EGFR/ ALK genetic alterations (United States and Europe). In the final exploratory analysis of the IMpower150 study, it was reported that the development of new brain metastases was delayed further by ABCP compared to BCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, in the real-world data analysis of IMpower150, intracranial response rates were over 50% regardless of whether symptomatic or asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, the mechanism of anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF against metastatic brain tumors is still not clarified. Further analysis of the anti-tumor effects of ICIs and VEGF inhibitor combinations on brain metastases is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10585_2024_10309_MOESM1_ESM.pptx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PPTX 616 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BBB</term><def><p id="Par2">Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BTB</term><def><p id="Par3">Blood&#8211;Tumor Barrier</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CLNs</term><def><p id="Par4">Cervical Lymph Nodes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DC</term><def><p id="Par5">Dendritic Cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCM</term><def><p id="Par6">Flow Cytometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIs</term><def><p id="Par7">Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IgG</term><def><p id="Par8">Immunoglobulin G</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHC</term><def><p id="Par9">Immunohistochemistry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mAb</term><def><p id="Par10">Monoclonal Antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDSC</term><def><p id="Par11">Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVD</term><def><p id="Par12">Microvessel Density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NK</term><def><p id="Par13">Natural Killer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSCLC</term><def><p>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD-1</term><def><p id="Par14">Programmed Death-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD-L1</term><def><p id="Par15">Programmed Death-Ligand 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RLU</term><def><p id="Par16">Relative Light Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Thconv</term><def><p id="Par17">Conventional Helper T</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Treg</term><def><p id="Par18">Regulatory T</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p id="Par19">Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Masako Miyazaki and Ikuno Sugimoto at Chugai for the technical assistance; Chisako Ishimaru, Mari Kinoshita, Yoshie Kuroiwa, Takanori Tachibe, Tasuku Nishino in the Chugai Research Institute For Medical Science vivo experimental group for preparing the brain metastasis model; Toko Funaki at Chugai for the helpful experimental assistance; Jacob Davis for English proofreading.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>CM designed the study and performed the majority experiments.
