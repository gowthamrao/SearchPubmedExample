We used R to analyze the tweets that contained a list of 79 keywords related to vaping.

Topic modeling generated 8 topics: linkage between vaping and risk of COVID-19 infection, vaping pneumonia and the origin of COVID-19, vaping and spread of COVID-19, vaping regulation, calling for quitting vaping, protecting youth, similarity between e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) and COVID-19, and sales information.

We found a substantial amount of anti-vaping discussion and dominantly negative sentiment around vaping during COVID-19, a sharp contrast to the predominantly pro-vaping voice on social media in the pre-COVID-19 period. Continued monitoring of social media conversations around vaping is needed, and the public health community may consider using social media platforms to actively convey scientific information around vaping and vaping cessation.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA 113710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4178-6746</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Lyu</surname><given-names>Chen Joanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute Grant T32 CA 113710 (JCL).

Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, there have been 108,733,129 confirmed cases globally as of February 12, 2021, and the United States has reported the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Smoking cigarettes has been associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, significant theoretical concerns have been raised about the potential increased risk among electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users for COVID-19 infection and syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although few studies specifically address e-cigarette use and COVID-19 outcomes.</p><p>Coronaviruses are respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and use of e-cigarettes (colloquially known as "vaping") has been associated with pulmonary inflammation in response to infection [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; therefore, e-cigarette users may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a 2020 cross-sectional study among adolescents and young adults, COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 times more likely among ever-users of e-cigarettes compared with non-users [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, vaping may impair immune response to viral infection, which may increase risk for many severe COVID-19 disease [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, these mechanisms suggest that those who vape may be more susceptible to pulmonary complications following a COVID-19 infection [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, researchers have also hypothesized that cannabidiol (CBD), which can be administered via vaping, has the potential to limit the severity and progression of COVID-19 symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, unsubstantiated health claims about vaping circulated online in the early period of the pandemic. For example, one study described comments that vape devices would increase humidity in the lungs and thereby prevent COVID-19 infections; and that propylene glycol (PG), a common ingredient in e-cigarettes, is able to destroy harmful COVID-19 airborne contagions [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Social media are increasingly preferred sources for health information dissemination and discussion [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and can affect health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, social media-based research studying the public discourse on vaping in the COVID-19 pandemic has been scant. Two studies focusing on both vaping and COVID-19 analyzed social media data before the end of April, 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. This declaration was found to have a significant impact on public awareness and behavior [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there has been lack of understanding of the public discourse at the intersection of COVID-19 and vaping when the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in full swing. Continued surveillance of social media data and monitoring of public discourse in this line are needed as the pandemic progresses [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To fill the gap, this study analyzed the public vaping discussion in COVID-19&#8211;related Twitter posts from March 11, 2020 through February 12, 2021 to identify the topics and sentiments from tweets around e-cigarettes and vaping. Understanding the public discourse on e-cigarettes and vaping and COVID-19 will not only shed light on public vaping-related perceptions, attitudes and concerns during a large-scale public health crisis, but also enable identification of possible misinformation and misconception around vaping in the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study will offer insights for vaping-related scientific knowledge promotion and interventions for curbing the spread of inaccurate information, which is especially crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented respiratory disease crisis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Data extraction and preprocessing</title><p>We downloaded the IDs from the website maintained by Georgia State University&#8217;s Panacea Lab [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], obtaining a total of 3,414,483 tweets, without retweets, from March 11, 2020 through February 12, 2021. These tweets were collected daily by the Panacea Lab using the following 13 keywords related to Covid-19: COVD19, CoronavirusPandemic, COVID-19, 2019nCoV, CoronaOutbreak, coronavirus, WuhanVirus, covid19, coronaviruspandemic, covid-19, 2019ncov, coronaoutbreak, and wuhanvirus. Since the Panacea Lab can provide only the IDs for the tweets, we need to convert the IDs back to the original tweets using the <italic toggle="yes">Hydrator</italic> software [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These data were collected using publicly available resources only and were accessed in compliance with Twitter terms of use.</p><p>During the data preprocessing stage, we used the <italic toggle="yes">gsub</italic> function in R (The R Foundation) to keep tweets whose language field was specified as English. We performed all text mining using RStudio Version 1.4.1103. Next, all the tweets were converted to lowercase. Referring to previous studies examining Twitter posts about e-cigarettes [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we used a list of 79 search keywords to extract vaping-related tweets, including general e-cigarette terms and their variants (e.g., e-cigarette, e-cig, e-juice, e-liquid, vaper, electronic cigarette, e-vaporizer, e-hookahs), e-cigarette brand names (eg, blu, JUUL, NJoy, green smoke, Krave), and e-cigarette use (eg, vaping, e-smoke, vapenation). After obtaining the relevant tweets for our analysis, we prepared two batches of tweets, one for text mining and the other for sentiment analysis. For text mining and sentiment analysis, the data has to be processed differently. Specifically, for sentiment analysis, we converted all the emojis to words, whereas for text mining we removed all the emojis since they do not provide essential information. Next, we created a script to remove the URLs, mentioned names, non-ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters, and all characters other than English letters or spaces (eg, &#8220;1,&#8221; &#8220;?,&#8221; etc). Duplicated tweets were removed using the R package <italic toggle="yes">dplyr</italic>, version 1.0.2. In order to filter tweets created by faked or bots accounts, we removed tweets that were almost identical. This is done using the document-term matrix (DTM) consisting of rows that correspond to the tweets and columns that correspond to the terms to identify similar terms in each tweet (see <xref rid="pone.0260290.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> for details). For tweets that were 80% similar, we retained the most representative one (i.e., the longest tweets in terms of the number of words). Furthermore, we used the <italic toggle="yes">tweetornot</italic> Version 0.1.0 package to remove users identified as bots with a 95% probability or higher.</p><p>The final cleaned data set consisted of 11,337 unique tweets from 7,710 different users. We further cleaned the tweets by removing the stopwords, i.e., words and characters that were of little or no analytical value (e.g, &#8220;a,&#8221; &#8220;and,&#8221;,&#8221;are&#8221;, &#8220;&amp;,&#8221; etc). We performed this task by creating our own list of stop words by appending the 13 keywords related to &#8220;COVID19&#8221; and the 79 keywords related to &#8220;vaping&#8221; to the standard English stop words list from the R package <italic toggle="yes">tidytext</italic>, version 0.2.6. The reason to add the keywords to the stopwords is that since every tweet would contain one or more of those keywords and having them in the tweets does not contribute to further our understanding of the tweets.

We can use it to discover hidden themes, group documents into the discovered themes, and summarize the documents by topic. Topic modeling is often referred to as <italic toggle="yes">soft</italic> clustering, but it is more robust and provides better and more realistic results than hard clustering methods (such as k-means clustering) [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A hard clustering algorithm assumes a distance measure between topics and assigns one topic to each document, whereas topic modeling assigns a document to a collection of topics with different probabilities without any assumption on the distance measure between topics. There are many topic models available. The most popular one for topic modeling is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], developed by David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I Jordan [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>To extract common topics, we performed the LDA algorithm on the cleaned tweets. This task is done using the R <italic toggle="yes">textmineR</italic> package, version 3.0.4. To run the LDA algorithm one needs to input the number of expected topics. Since the number of topics is unknown to begin with, we need to run the LDA algorithm for a range of different topic numbers and choose one that maximize the coherence score. The LDA algorithm was run on the data for topic numbers from 2 through 20. For each topic number, we calculated the coherence score using the <italic toggle="yes">textmineR</italic> package. Based on the coherence score plot, we chose 8 topics for the final model, since the topic number = 8 yielded the highest coherence score (<xref rid="pone.0260290.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). We also implemented the interpolation algorithm to plot the distribution of the quantity of daily tweets about each topic [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0260290.g002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0260290.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Coherence scores for different numbers of topics.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0260290.g002.jpg"/></fig><p>We extracted the top eight terms from each of the 8 topics. For each tweet, the LDA algorithm assigned a (conditional) probability p(topic <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> | tweet <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>) to each of the 8 topics. The topic with the highest probability is assigned a tweet. Afterward, the tweets are grouped according to the most prevalent topics. Representative tweets for each topic were obtained by randomly sampling 100 tweets from each topic. Two of the authors then independently examined the sampled tweets. Through a group discussion, the authors select the most representative ones. If one of the authors thought that there were no conspicuous topics that emerged from the first 100 sampled tweets, another 100 tweets would be sampled and further reviewed. This process continued until the two authors reached consensus on a clear common topic. To facilitate the topic assignment, we used the <italic toggle="yes">textmineR</italic> package&#8217;s topic label function to generate an initial set of topics. After carefully reading through the sampled tweets from each topic, the authors refined the machine-generated labeling to give each topic a concise description.

Some of the topics we identified were similar to public vaping discussions reported in the literature before the COVID-19 pandemic, such as harms from vaping and vaping regulation [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, we found that during the pandemic, these topics were further linked with COVID-19. For example, tweets mentioning harms from vaping stressed that vaping compromises the lung and respiratory system and further increased risk of COVID-19 infection [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Past studies of Twitter data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic found negative or mixed reactions to e-cigarette regulation dominated the public discourse [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our study during the pandemic, tweeters opposing vaping regulations claimed that policymakers took advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to ban vaping (Topic 4). Findings of this study are consistent with findings of early analyses of public vaping-related discourse on social media from the beginning of the pandemic till the end of April 2020, where discussion about shutting down vape stores [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and transmission of coronavirus by sharing vapes was identified [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the main finding of the Janmohamed study [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], emergence of discourse around vape-administered CBD treatment for COVID-19, was not identified in this study. This may be because that majority of the data analyzed by the Janmohamed study were blogs, and information spread on different media platforms is different. Another possible reason is that as the pandemic progressed, discourse about vape-administered CBD treatment for COVID-19 gradually decreased. Tweets mentioning CBD appeared mainly in the sales information topic in this study. In addition, one thing in common with the pre-COVID-19 twitter analysis is that significant events can greatly stimulate discussion. The most obvious example of event-based discussion was the publication of the Gaiha study [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which had the biggest numbers of daily tweets during our study.</p><p>Another important finding of this study is that the public discourse on vaping in the COVID-19-related tweets was not overwhelmingly pro-vaping. This differs from the prior literature: a 2019 published scoping review of messages presented in e-cigarette discussion on multiple social media platforms including Twitter concluded that the social media had been dominated by pro-vaping messages disseminated by the vaping industry and vaping proponents [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Though pro-vaping content, such as advocating harm reduction and opposing vaping regulations existed in public discussion in our Twitter data, anti-vaping voices were conspicuous. A considerable number of tweets discussed the harm from vaping on lungs, and pointed out this would increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and complications. Tweets involving the negative impact of vaping on adolescents and young adults, and protecting the young population during the pandemic and when youth return to school after lockdowns accounted for over 10% of the tweets in our analysis. We also found the topic of calling for quitting vaping emerged in the public vaping discourse, and information of Quitline, educational websites, and webinars were provided in many tweets. In contrast, pre-COVID-19 studies found that Twitter was heavily exploited by the e-cigarette industry, and that tweets related to e-cigarettes were overwhelmingly advertising and commercial [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which lead to findings that vaping discussion was dominated by pro&#8211;e-cigarette content [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Though this study did not analyze the source of each piece of content, the existence of anti-vaping voices in our data suggests that sources other than the e-cigarette industry have begun to utilize Twitter to express themselves.</p><p>Analysis of public discourse on social media provides an opportunity to understand the information that the public is inadvertently exposed to, which may help to explain health-related behavior and offer insight for public health interventions. There have been various conspiracy theories about COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When it came to the intersection of COVID-19 and vaping, we found that while the similarity of symptoms between COVID-19 cases and EVALI were mentioned as evidence supporting conspiracy theories that the US was the origin of COVID-19 and covered up early COVID-19 infections by labeling them &#8220;vaping pneumonia,&#8221; the symptom similarities were also used to remind people to tell doctors about their e-cigarette use in order to assist with diagnostic accuracy. Social media have played a large role in the spread of conspiracies [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, learning how to use social media platforms to quickly identify the conspiracy theories and effectively correct misinformation should be an area that deserves more efforts in the future public health crises. This study also found that the harm reduction discourse around vaping still existed in the pandemic as in the pre-COVID-19 period. To cope with the stress and anxiety in the crisis, many used tobacco and alcohol as coping strategies [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the harm reduction concept may potentially lead people to vaping to alleviate stressful emotion in the pandemic. In addition, we found Twitter contained information that may significantly influence efforts to combat COVID-19, such as the usefulness of wearing masks to prevent COVID-19 infection. Surveillance of social media discussions would help identify needs for information or recommendations that health authorities should aim to address. Last but not least, the predominantly negative sentiment about vaping in tweets in our study was consistent with survey findings among young vapers that reported 57% worry that their vaping puts them at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 and 62% indicate more interest in quitting vaping now compared to before the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that the pandemic is an opportunity to support quitting vaping. The improving sentiment about vaping also suggests it is important to act quickly, seize the opportunity to increase the public awareness of vaping harm, and urge more people to quit.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations</title><p>This paper studied Twitter data to understand of the public vaping and COVID-19 discussion on social media. Though Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms and widely used as the social media data source in academic work [<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0260290.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], it is not the only one. Therefore, to fully understand the public discussion about vaping, social media data from more sources should be included. Second, this study focused on the content of Twitter posts and did not examine the characteristics of the Twitter users who were the producers and posters of the content. Knowing the characteristics of posters of certain topics may illuminate some of the dissenting voices we found, to not only deepen our understanding of the dynamics and motivation behind the topics, but also provide more insight into future monitoring and regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Analysis of vaping discussion in COVID-19-related Twitter posts provided a unique opportunity to understand public opinion around vaping in the pandemic. While the public discourse on vaping in the COVID-19 Twitter posts shared common content with that before the COVID-19 pandemic, distinction between the two periods was obvious and more COVID-19 related topics emerged. In contrast to prior studies that found a predominantly pro-vaping voice in the pre-COVID-19 period, we found a noticeable anti-vaping discourse and the public sentiment around vaping was predominantly negative in the tweets during the time period of our study. This study highlights the need to continue monitoring social media conversations as they evolve, in order to provide timely interventions that may influence health outcomes and the success of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The public health community may need to consider using more social media platforms to correct misinformation and actively convey scientific information to around vaping and vaping cessation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0260290.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0260290.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0260290.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Johns Hopkins Medicine.
