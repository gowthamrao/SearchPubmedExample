</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder diagnosed on the basis of the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cluster headache attacks (CHs) are characterized by severe, strictly unilateral pain in the orbital, supraorbital, temporal area or in any combination of these sites; CHs last 15&#8211;180&#160;min and occur once every other day to eight times a day. During the most severe episodes, the pain is unbearably intense. CHs are associated with ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and ptosis and/or eyelid edema with restlessness or agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Attacks typically occur in clusters that last for weeks or months, known as cluster periods or bouts, which are followed by remission phases that usually span months or years. However, approximately 10&#8211;15% of patients experience chronic CH, characterized by the absence of these remission periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Unpredictable, often nocturnal CHs are among the most severe pain disorders in humans. This disorder has a serious impact not only on social life, relationships, and family life but also on professional activities and the ability to work. Comorbidities such as anxiety disorders, depression, and sleep disorders can also occur, which can greatly increase the level of suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The onset of CHs most commonly occurs between the ages of 20 and 40&#160;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CHs can begin in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or even later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">On average, it takes 8&#160;years before the diagnosis of CH is made and adequate treatment is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent research suggests that the diagnostic delay for CHs has decreased. A systematic review by Buture et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] revealed that patients with CHs frequently visit multiple healthcare providers and experience delays of 3&#8211;9&#160;years before obtaining an accurate diagnosis. This review highlights that delays in diagnosing CHs remain a prevalent issue, with the time to diagnosis differing across countries. In contrast, the Danish Cluster Headache Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] revealed a reduction in diagnostic delays over each decade studied, although atypical features of CHs were linked to extended delays in diagnosis. Enhancing medical education and increasing awareness of the condition are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and reduce diagnostic delays. Similarly, a multicenter registry study conducted in South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated a steady improvement in diagnosis rates over time, underscoring the benefits of heightened awareness and revised diagnostic criteria. The data indicate that psychological comorbidities such as anxiety, depression and suicidality increase continuously with increasing delays in diagnosis. Further studies have shown that CHs are a risk factor for psychiatric comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a result, prolonged diagnostic delays may exacerbate the condition, particularly concerning psychiatric aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In Germany, headache patients are initially treated in general practice. If specialized treatment is needed, patients are referred to a neurologist. Specialists with an additional qualification in specialized pain therapy are available as an additional option. If sufficient therapy results cannot be achieved on an outpatient basis, admission for inpatient treatment is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In 2022, 1049 men and 527 women with CHs were treated as inpatients in hospitals throughout Germany (ICD-10 code G44.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Inpatient Multimodal Pain Therapy (MPT) in Germany, defined under OPS 8-918, is a structured, interdisciplinary treatment approach for patients suffering from chronic pain conditions that cannot be adequately managed with standard outpatient care. It integrates multiple therapeutic disciplines to address the biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to pain. It is a comprehensive, evidence-based approach aimed at providing effective relief for complex chronic pain conditions. It exemplifies a biopsychosocial model of care, ensuring patients receive individualized, interdisciplinary treatment tailored to their specific needs. OPS 8&#8211;918 serves as the coding standard for billing multimodal pain therapy within the German healthcare system. Proper documentation of the therapy's interdisciplinary nature, duration, and intensity is essential for reimbursement under statutory health insurance. For hospital admission for multimodal pain therapy, the requirements of the operation and procedure code OPS 8&#8211;918 must be met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Multimodal pain therapy must be carried out by specialists in at least two disciplines, one of whom must come from the fields of psychiatry, psychosomatics or psychology-psychotherapy. Patients must have at least three of the following characteristics for admission:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par10">Manifested or imminent impairment of quality of life and/or the ability to work</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Failure of previous unimodal pain therapy, pain-related surgery or withdrawal treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Existing dependence on or the misuse of medication</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Concomitant mental illness as a maintaining factor for pain</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">Serious concomitant somatic illness</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par15">These criteria generally describe the requirements for inpatient therapy for pain disorders. The specific headache phenotype, accompanying symptoms, and psychological impact that lead to admission of patients with CHs are not yet known. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the characteristics of patients who were admitted to a tertiary headache center in 2018, 2019, and 2020 due to CHs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par16">In this retrospective data analysis, the data of patients with a principal diagnosis of CH who were experiencing an active cluster period and were admitted to the tertiary headache center of the Kiel Migraine and Headache Centre in 2018, 2019, and 2020 for multimodal inpatient pain therapy were recorded. All patients included in this study provided written informed consent for the collection and analysis of their data. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the University of Kiel (D 626/20). Patient confidentiality and data protection were ensured throughout the study, and all data were anonymized prior to analysis.</p><p id="Par17">The headache phenotypic data were collected via the standardized Kiel Headache Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] prior to hospitalization. To additionally record the impact of CHs, the Migraine Disability Assessment Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the Beck Depression Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] were used.</p><p id="Par18">The Kiel Headache Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is a standardized questionnaire that is designed to record headache phenotypes, comorbidities and impacts on psychosocial life. The paper&#8210;pencil questionnaire is completed by patients before admission to the hospital to record their symptoms in advance and to check whether the admission criteria for the procedure code OPS 8&#8211;918 are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The questionnaire consists of detailed questions on the location, intensity, time course, frequency, character, accompanying symptoms and concomitant diseases of headache patients.</p><p id="Par19">The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) is a validated questionnaire that was specifically developed to measure impairment in people with migraine in everyday life. It consists of five questions that document impairment at school or work, performance at home and participation in family, social, and leisure activities over the last 3&#160;months by indicating the days affected. Disability is ultimately assessed via a point system: no or little impairment is given up to 5 points, minor impairment is given up to 10 points, moderate impairment is given up to 20 points, and severe impairment is given from 21 points onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) is a validated psychological test that was developed as a short version to determine the severity of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It categorizes depressive symptoms into four severity levels based on the total score, which ranges from 0 to 63. A score between 0 and 13 indicates minimal depression, reflecting little to no depressive symptoms and is considered within the normal range of mood variability. A score of 14 to 19 represents mild depression, where symptoms are present but typically do not cause significant impairment in daily functioning. Individuals scoring 20 to 28 fall into the category of moderate depression, where symptoms are more pronounced and begin to interfere with work, social activities, and general daily life. Scores between 29 and 63 indicate severe depression, characterized by significant distress and functional impairment, often accompanied by symptoms such as hopelessness, pervasive sadness, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts.</p><p id="Par21">The WHODAS 2.0 records functional ability and disability caused by a disease. The domains are based on the conceptual framework of the WHO's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF), which has been the international standard since 2001. The WHODAS 2.0 assesses health status on the basis of 36 questions from six different domains: cognition, understanding and communication, mobility, self-care, social interaction and social participation. Each of the 36 answers is assigned a predefined score: &#8220;None&#8221;&#8212;1, &#8220;Low&#8221;&#8212;2, &#8220;Moderate&#8221;&#8212;3, &#8220;Strong&#8221;&#8212;4 and &#8220;Very strong/not possible&#8221;&#8212;5. All the points are then added together to obtain a total score that reflects a patient's state of health. The total score represents the overall state of health in relation to the six health areas. The higher the scores are, the greater the disease-related burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistics</title><p id="Par22">Unless otherwise stated, the percentage frequency (%) is used to describe categorical variables.

The patients met the general admission criteria for inpatient multimodal pain therapy according to the procedure code OPS 8&#8211;918 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The analysis revealed a pronounced symptom complex in patients with CHs that went far beyond the purely diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most patients had a chronic, long-term disease course of more than 5&#160;years. The gender ratio of men:women was 1.6:1, which is significantly lower than that of the overall population of those affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Almost all patients with CHs experience attacks with severe to very severe pain intensity with a high daily frequency. Approximately 80% of patients with CHs have attacks between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., with a particularly high incidence of approximately one-third between 0 a.m. and 3 a.m. This usually results in severe sleep disorders with exhaustion, a lack of energy and an inability to work. A total of 31.4% of patients have a permanent headache in the cluster area, which contributes to further disability. Persisting pain in the cluster area has also been described in other detailed analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] but has not yet been included in the ICHD criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">In addition to the criteria specified in the ICHD-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], affected individuals have partially severe accompanying psychological symptoms and psychosocial impacts of CHs. Exhaustion, fatigue, concentration difficulties and a lack of energy are the most common symptoms. Most individuals with CHs are no longer able to carry out social activities or everyday activities. They experience rumination, irritability, reduced performance, protective behavior, anxiety, increased pain progression, and gloomy thoughts. Patients often experience tension at work or in the family, the inability to work and frequent visits to the doctor.</p><p id="Par45">Complex psychological effects have also been reported in other studies, particularly when patients with CHs receive a delayed diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This can result in frequent changes in doctors, treatments that are not indicated, and increases in suffering and disease progression. The increasing knowledge and application of the ICHD-3 criteria in healthcare has led to a reduction in diagnostic delays in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, atypical features of CHs and multiple diagnoses, such as the combination of CHs with migraine or medication overuse headache, can lead to delays in diagnosis or incorrect treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our data highlight the great significance of the psychological impact of CHs in the family, social and professional spheres. The treatment of CHs should therefore focus not only on CH therapy and prevention but also on the psychological impact of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This could lead to hospital admissions being avoided. Multidisciplinary treatment involving psychiatric and psychological disciplines should also be considered at an early stage in the outpatient sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The stressful effects of CHs are particularly evident in the high frequency of suicidal ideation. Over 40% of the patients surveyed had suicidal ideation at times, and over 7% experienced suicidal ideation regularly; 1.8% of the patients would commit suicide if they had the opportunity. Accordingly, almost 80% of people with CHs reported symptoms attributable to depression in the BDI. This high frequency of suicidal ideation confirms the findings of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Demoralization, helplessness, hopelessness, and subjective incompetence to control pain are important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Therefore, patients should be screened for both suicidal ideation and demoralization.</p><p id="Par47">The high burden of treatment-refractory CHs was also reflected in the MIDAS score (grade 4), corresponding to very severe disability, for almost all those affected. MIDAS was developed to record the disability caused by migraine. However, it can also be used as a measure of disability from other headaches such as CHs. This was also evident in the WHODAS 2.0 analysis, in which over 92% of patients with CHs had severely restricted health and functional ability and a high degree of impairment. The individual burden of CH is very high. The results support the need to develop further treatment options. Patients with CHs should be screened in an outpatient setting via appropriate scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Psychosocial counseling involving the family, partner and workplace during treatment can help reduce the level of suffering and increase awareness and understanding.</p><p id="Par48">The admitted patients were usually registered by specialized neurologists or pain therapists. The patients were treated in the outpatient area in accordance with the guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Accordingly, the reasons for admission were not the lack of individual measures, such as attack therapy, prevention, or invasive measures such as GON blocks. In contrast, these options have generally been implemented several times without sufficient effects. This led to the development of the symptom complex described in the procedure code OPS 8&#8211;918 as an admission criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The data from this study are relevant from a clinical perspective. They showed that CHs can be an extremely serious condition for affected individuals and can have serious consequences if only unimodal medication is used. CHs affect almost all areas of professional, social, and family life. They cause severe psychological symptoms such as depression, social withdrawal, anxiety, and suicidal behavior. Psychosocial factors must therefore be given close attention in the care of patients with CHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition to specific medications for the acute treatment and prevention of CHs, the therapeutic approach should also include education, psychotherapeutic measures and the involvement of relatives. This should become as normal as it is for other serious illnesses, such as cancer. CHs can lead to considerable emotional stress, such as anxiety, depression, grief, and hopelessness. Patients need help to address the diagnosis, process emotions, and develop coping strategies. Emotional stability must be promoted, and coping with physical symptoms such as pain must become easier. Patients must be motivated to continue their medical treatment consistently and to persevere through difficult therapies. Relatives are often also under psychological strain. Psychologists can help relatives cope better with the situation and support patients. Psychological interventions can reduce the risk of anxiety disorders, depression and posttraumatic stress disorders or treat such disorders in a targeted manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The epidemiology of CHs has been analyzed in several population-based studies. The incidence characteristics are summarized as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The 12-month incidence of CHs is approximately 0.1&#8211;0.2%. This means that approximately 80,000&#8211;160,000 people are affected by CHs in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Men experience CHs more frequently than women do, with a ratio of approximately 3.5:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The onset of the disease typically occurs around the age of 30&#160;years. However, attacks can occur as early as childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. First-degree relatives of affected individuals have an 18-fold increased risk of also developing CHs. For second-degree relatives, the risk is up to three times greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d shows the frequency distribution of patients treated as inpatients in Germany in 2021 with the main diagnosis of ICD-10 code G44.0 according to data from the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A total of 1049 men and 527 women were hospitalized nationwide. The data collected in this study show the severity of the disease and the variety of symptoms in this patient group for the first time.</p><p id="Par51">This study has several limitations. By retrospectively analyzing patients who were admitted for inpatient treatment, patients with particularly severe disease were included in the study. The resulting clinical headache phenotype therefore represents particularly severe forms. These findings cannot be generalized to the overall group of patients with CHs. MIDAS was originally developed for the assessment of migraine disability, so the transfer of grades for cluster headache may not be discriminative. The analyses are based on the answers given in the questionnaires. The patients indicated their phenotype and the effects of the pain from memory. Therefore, recall bias may influence the data. However, in view of the very long course of CHs, it can be assumed that the influence of such a bias is small.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">This study revealed a pronounced symptom complex in patients with CHs who were admitted for inpatient treatment, which extended far beyond the purely diagnostic criteria. Most patients had a chronic, long-term disease course. The attacks occurred with a strong to very strong intensity of pain with a high daily frequency. Those affected experienced particularly severe suffering caused by the accompanying psychological symptoms and the psychosocial impact of CHs. The severe and stressful complications of CHs were particularly evident in the high frequency of suicidal ideation in more than 40% of the patients analyzed. Psychosocial factors must therefore be given close attention in the care of patients with CHs. In addition to specific medications for the acute treatment and prevention of CHs, the therapeutic approach should also include education, psychotherapeutic measures. and the involvement of relatives.
