</title><p id="Par4">Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among American women. After lung cancer, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality have occurred as a result of screening mammography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends biennial breast screening mammography for all women ages 50&#8211;74 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], whereas the American College of Radiology (ACR) and Society for Breast Imaging (SBI) recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40 and continuing beyond age 74 unless life expectancy is limited by comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8226;]. According to the National Cancer Institute, if breast cancer is detected early, the 5-year survival rate is greater than 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Facilities offering mammography services are plentiful, and both commercial and government-sponsored health insurance plans offer screening mammography examinations at little to no cost to individual patients. Despite resources and existing recommendations, the American Cancer Society estimates 43,250 deaths from breast cancer in 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. What follows is a discussion of the factors creating barriers to breast imaging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>COVID-19</title><p id="Par5">In 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a worldwide pandemic. Non-urgent screening services were discouraged, and screening rates declined precipitously during the height of the pandemic. Nearly 285,000 breast imaging exams were missed from March 2020 through June 2020 in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The long-term consequences of missed or delayed screening during this time are unknown. The pandemic highlighted elements that serve as barriers to breast care, including the lack of financial means, mistrust in government and healthcare authorities, and limitations of access related to physical and social isolation which affected the emotional and mental state of many individuals.</p><p id="Par6">The average cost of a screening mammogram in the USA is $353 per insurance beneficiary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The pandemic, however, increased unemployment rates in the USA to 14.8%, the highest level since 1948, and the labor force participation declined to 60.2% in April 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Rising unemployment rates and the concurrent loss of health insurance contributed to the decline in health screening and wellness visits. Another important deterrent to screening visits included government-issued stay-at-home orders. The evolving nature of the virus in its transmission along with ongoing changes in rules and regulations to slow its spread resulted in the public being reluctant to leave their homes, use public transport, and seek medical care unless for coronavirus concerns. With stay-at-home orders, lay-offs, and overwhelming uncertainty revolving around the pandemic came a 25% increase in depression rates among Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is not surprising that individuals were hesitant and unmotivated to seek preventative healthcare services. Public mistrust and skepticism toward government regulations and healthcare authorities may have also contributed to the neglect of universal healthcare recommendations. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of financial wellness and trust in government and healthcare authorities as key constituents for improving patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par7">The American Cancer Society launched the &#8220;return to screening&#8221; initiative in 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and physicians were advised to do so in a patient-sensitive manner. Physicians and patients were urged to take the time to comprehend the new obstacles and burdens posed by the pandemic, such as the lack of health insurance. After the pandemic became manageable and the screening programs resumed in 2022, many breast cancers were diagnosed, albeit after some delays in detection. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 287,850 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disparities in Diverse Patient Populations</title><p id="Par8">Sustained inequities among a diverse patient population contribute to rising cancer rates in the USA. Disparities in healthcare exist across diverse groups divided along the lines of race, age, gender, culture, religion, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and disability. Poorer outcomes in breast cancer are observed among non-White racial groups, younger patients, transgender and gender-diverse individuals, and in cultures that may implicate shame associated with a breast cancer diagnosis.</p><p id="Par9">Though breast cancer is less common in African-American women, a 40% higher mortality due to breast cancer is observed among Black women compared to non-Hispanic white women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of all ethnic groups, Native Americans have the lowest breast cancer screening rates due to their geographic isolation from mammography facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Without transportation, time, or financial means, there are many hurdles to access healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As it currently stands, there is a growing opportunity for evidence-based practice with transgender and gender-diverse individuals, promoting a gap in breast health and awareness in this population. Breast radiologists play a critical role in educating women and their primary care providers on the benefits of regular screening mammography in order to take advantage of this potentially lifesaving medical examination.</p><p id="Par10">Even within the framework of good access to care, not all medical facilities have the same imaging technologies. For example, although digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has increased sensitivity in diagnosing breast cancer compared to digital mammography, only 8443 of the 21,421 accredited mammography units in the USA with specialty-trained breast radiologists are utilizing DBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. DBT is more frequently offered to privately insured patients than patients who are not insured or have Medicaid coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Language and cultural barriers lead to ineffective counseling and education of the patient. Lower breast cancer screening participation and follow-up care are observed in Spanish-speaking only patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of language translators at healthcare facilities helps to alleviate some of the communication barriers; however, if providers are unaware and/or insensitive of a patient&#8217;s culture, they are apt to be less effective in conveying important healthcare instructions to the patient. Common reasons for a patient&#8217;s lack of follow-up include misunderstanding of the breast imaging results, patient misconceptions that the healthcare provider is uncaring, and personal or cultural biases as it relates to breast health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Breast cancer screening among the LGBTQIA&#8201;+&#8201;population is scant. Current literature suggests that male-to-female transgender individuals comprise a group with the lowest rates of breast cancer screening participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This may be due to a lack of education on the part of both transgender individuals and physicians. In 2020, Huang et al. reported zero out of 40 breast center websites mentioned transgender care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further studies are warranted to show what is necessary to optimize healthcare access in this population and work towards establishing universally accepted subpopulation-specific guidelines.</p><p id="Par13">Mobile mammography services provide an important and effective mechanism to improve access by bringing mammography services to the patient. The patients served may live in remote, rural, and underserved locations as well as in urban locations. Mobile mammography services brought to schools, primary care facilities, health fairs, and work environments make it easy and convenient for women to fit mammography services into their schedules. Working women have multiple responsibilities, and making the time to get a screening mammogram may not be prioritized accordingly. In this manner, barriers to care related to geographic isolation and lack of time may be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Physical Disabilities and Discrimination</title><p id="Par14">In the USA, there are 61 million Americans living with a disability. Adults over age 65, women, and minorities represent the highest rates of disability, with one in four Americans reporting some disability overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients living with disabilities often encounter many barriers in accessing and receiving preventive and screening services related to their routine medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Of the 25% of adults in the USA reporting a disability, the most common type of disability is mobility related, which entails serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], although the spectrum of various types of disability is vast. Mobility challenged disabled individuals may have difficulty transporting themselves or coordinating transportation to a healthcare facility. With such extensive barriers in place, it is understandable yet alarming that patients with chronic disabling conditions are less likely to undergo breast cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The American Cancer Society recommends that women aged 40&#8211;44 have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms if they wish to do so, and by age 45, women should receive annual mammograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women with average breast cancer risk should begin screening at age 40 and annually thereafter without an upper age limit, unless restricted by severe comorbidities after age 74 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, individuals with physical disabilities are less likely to receive preventative services, although the risk of developing cancer remains unchanged. Most primary care visits are focused on the underlying disability and related comorbidities, rather than preventative health concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The low rate of screening mammograms combined with comorbid obesity contribute to the observed higher incidence of late-stage breast cancers with higher mortality among disabled individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Healthcare providers and patients should be aware of the importance of preventative screenings in disabled populations as this is often overlooked in this population.</p><p id="Par16">Mammography equipment can pose a significant problem for individuals using a wheelchair. Obtaining high-quality diagnostic imaging on a patient in a wheelchair or on an individual who cannot stand can be challenging for the radiologist, technologist, and patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. According to the ACR, ultrasound can be considered for those who qualify but cannot undergo MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While ultrasound is not routinely performed for breast exam screening, the alternative, which involves no imaging modality whatsoever, remains unfavored. Sakellariou et al. explored the barriers faced by adults with pre-existing physical disabilities and concluded that cancer services need to be flexible and accessible, with consideration to services being offered in a respectful manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) will likely prove to be an alternative for patients with mobility issues as patients are seated during CEM. With disability rates expected to increase, both patients and providers must be educated on the best possible ways to mitigate unnecessary risk and reduce imaging barriers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mental Health Considerations</title><p id="Par17">While physical disabilities present a very real concern to individuals receiving screening and diagnostic imaging, individuals with mental health disorders pose unique psychiatric barriers to screening. Research has shown that people with severe mental illness (SMI) receive less preventive healthcare services overall as compared to the general population. It is not surprising that these disparities extend to women with SMI in receiving preventative breast cancer screenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several studies have shown that breast cancer patients with a history of SMI, especially those exhibiting psychotic disorders, have higher mortality from breast cancer than those without SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8226;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Patients with SMI are more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced cancer stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is evident that individuals experiencing mental health illness face additional hurdles in accessing screening, diagnostic, and treatment-related breast cancer care. Opportunities exist to better promote preventative health services and target outreach campaigns in underserved communities. Ongoing efforts to integrate primary and psychiatric care remain at the forefront to bridge the disparities in breast cancer screening for women with SMI. Previous studies have suggested sending mammogram screening results to both primary care and mental health providers as a means to engage the patient from multiple healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">While mental health considerations pose a substantial obstacle in receiving preventative breast cancer screenings, breast cancer patients are known to have high rates of psychological comorbidities, and many do not receive the psychiatric care they ask for or need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Though there are many variables to consider, patients who report having a supportive doctor-patient relationship have less acute and emerging psychiatric co-morbidities than those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Patients value the emotional support and care they receive from physicians as they navigate various health concerns. Patient-physician interactions provide insight into ways in which physicians can better screen for mental health concerns. In addition, these encounters provide an opportunity for physicians to evaluate how the interaction can have a beneficial impact on patient health and outcomes.</p><p id="Par19">Breast cancer survivors comprise the largest group of cancer survivors. As of January 2022, 18.1 million cancer survivors live in the USA, with 4.1 million of these representing breast cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In 2018, research out of Oxford reported that psychological comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, neurocognitive dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and suicide are more common in breast cancer survivors compared with noncancer groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The association between breast cancer survivorship and adverse mental health outcomes is compelling and presents an urgent call to action as the mental health crisis in America continues to emerge after the COVID-19 pandemic. Breast cancer survivors need support to circumvent the risk of developing depression. Physicians should screen for associated mental health concerns at each patient encounter, from the time of cancer diagnosis and throughout treatment as 20% of women reported depressive symptoms of clinical depression that persisted even 2&#160;years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Providers can advocate for their patients by screening for mental health wellness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">Reducing barriers to breast imaging and bridging the various disparity gaps that exist continues to be an ongoing opportunity. Physicians and patients should evaluate new barriers to healthcare created by the pandemic in order to reestablish pre-pandemic breast screening rates. Numerous healthcare inequities necessitate ongoing efforts to eliminate disparities based on race, gender, cultural diversity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Additional research on the psychological burdens associated with breast cancer is also required to better understand how to collectively meet the complex needs of all aspects of a patient&#8217;s well-being.
