In April 2020, as providers and patients conformed with social distancing mandates, worked to decongest health care facilities, and minimized COVID-19 exposure, telemedicine use surged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Telemedicine insurance claims grew 23-fold from January to June 2020, and by October 2020, 43% of Americans had used a telemedicine service in the prior six months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Reports suggest that telemedicine continued to be used frequently into 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">An increase in telemedicine use is thus one potential lasting effect of the pandemic on the American health care system. Providers and patients are now more accustomed to telemedicine as compared to prior to the pandemic. Protocols, technology, and norms are in place for its regular use in many settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. With the conclusion of the official public health emergency on May 11, 2023<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, many telemedicine policies are still in flux and there are debates on how it should be used moving forward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Key questions include which health systems use telemedicine, which diseases and conditions telemedicine is used for, and which policies incentivize telemedicine use.</p><p id="Par9">First, a key question is which health systems provide care via telemedicine. Telemedicine can help make health care more convenient, reduce travel time, and minimize lost work hours, but primarily for those with digital literacy and good internet access&#8212;characteristics which are less common among older, low-income, racial and ethnic minority, and rural populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Research on telemedicine during the pandemic has shown lower frequency of telemedicine use among African American persons relative to non-Hispanic white persons, as well as lower use for rural residents and older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, while most studies focus on patient factors, there is a gap in understanding what kinds of health systems offer telemedicine, which may be the strongest predictor of use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Second, it is important for clinicians to develop best practices around what kinds of care telemedicine should be used for. Some interactions cannot be conducted virtually (e.g., physical exams) but others, such as counseling, can be delivered via telemedicine with comparable effectiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The existing literature on telemedicine is often fragmented by specialty; for example, studies have separately examined the trends of telemedicine use for mental health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, diabetes care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, HIV care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, we are unaware of any studies to date which compare the mode of care provision for all specialities throughout the duration of the pandemic. Having a systematic understanding of how telemedicine is currently being used can help clinicians across specialties start to develop principles for how and when to deploy this modality.</p><p id="Par11">Finally, there are ongoing policy discussions at the state and federal levels around how much telemedicine should persist and how to pay for it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Prior to the pandemic, unclear or lower reimbursement rates for telemedicine were cited as a barrier to adoption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The regulatory environment for telemedicine shifted rapidly early in the pandemic to include payment parity policies, which refer to whether providers are reimbursed for telemedicine by the payer at the same rate as they would for a comparable in-person service. Medicare and most state Medicaid programs instituted payment parity at the beginning of the pandemic, as did six of seven major commercial insurers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Some states also mandated payment parity for all commercial insurers, both prior to and during the pandemic. Stable, clear, and equivalent reimbursement rates for telemedicine may have incentivized providers to scale up telemedicine rapidly during the early stages of the pandemic and invest in technology and adaptation for its use longer term. Several studies have shown increased telemedicine use in states with payment parity policies relative to states without those policies for contraceptive visits, newly diagnosed cancer care, among community health centers and in patient surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, there is a gap in understanding how payment parity policies affected telemedicine provision in the health system more broadly and whether this increase differed by health system characteristics starting at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.</p><p id="Par12">In this study, we tackle these three questions about the ongoing role of telemedicine. Using a large electronic health records database, we characterize the health systems where telemedicine was provided and for what diseases and conditions from January 2019 until March 2023. We also compare telemedicine use, with a focus on the early pandemic period and thereafter, across states that did or did not implement payment parity laws. We find that telemedicine grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic; by March 2023 it remained more common than prior to the pandemic. Health systems in urban areas used telemedicine as a share of outpatient visits at a higher rate than health systems in rural areas during the study period and care for mental health and substance abuse was most common. Payment parity policies were associated with a small increase in telemedicine use in the first quarter of 2023. Overall, our study aims to provide policymakers and clinicians with a perspective on who is providing telemedicine for what and the role of payment parity policies in supporting telemedicine use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data and participants</title><p id="Par13">We utilized electronic health record (EHR) data that were aggregated by Healthjump, a data management platform that standardizes inputs between different EHR vendors. The Healthjump database includes records from 1327 health systems and 117 million unique patients across 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC, collectively referred to here as states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These data are comparable in characteristics to the nationally representative 2019 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and have been used in several published peer-reviewed studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Pro-bono access to the Healthjump data were supplied by the COVID-19 Research Database partners. This study was deemed not human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington (#11304), which waived the need for informed consent and approved the set up and use of the data by co-authors.</p><p id="Par14">For this analysis, we included data on encounters from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2023, the last month available from Healthjump. Our unit of analysis is a health system, captured by all patient visits recorded in a shared EHR platform, which we take to represent commonly owned or managed health facilities and/or provider groups. Each encounter in Healthjump was associated with a particular health system identifier. To limit the impact of new units joining or leaving the database, we included only systems that report at least 50 consultations per year during 2019&#8211;2022 and at least one consultation during the first three months of 2023. We further excluded health systems that did not report any data on patient race or ethnicity or had improbable race or ethnicity values. We additionally excluded inpatient and emergency room visits and patient records missing three-digit ZIP code, gender, or birth year information (&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.1% of patients). Exclusions are depicted in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Variable definitions</title><p id="Par15">All CPT procedure codes were grouped into consultations, defined as&#160;all procedures that occurred for a single patient on a single day. The condition or disease causing care was identified using the primary diagnosis code from the International Classification of Diseases Tenth or Ninth Revision (ICD-10 or ICD-9). The diagnosis codes were grouped into 31 categories of conditions using methods previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Telemedicine was identified by use of CPT modifier codes 93, 95, GT, FQ, or FR for any procedure in a consultation. These modifier codes refer to synchronous audio-visual or audio-only communication between a patient and provider<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Of the used telemedicine modifiers in the data, 99.5% were codes 95 or GT, which both refer to care provided by interactive audio and video communication systems. However, documented flaws in the data do not allow us to definitively distinguish between audio-only and audio-visual communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Patient race and ethnicity are reported in the EHR. These were grouped into five mutually exclusive groups: Hispanic (of any race); white (non-Hispanic); Black (non-Hispanic); Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic) (AAPI); and American Indian or Alaska Native (non-Hispanic) (AI/AN), consistent with the Office of Management and Budget 1977 standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We imputed race and ethnicity using multiple imputation and ten imputations with a logistic regression model for ethnicity and polytomous logistic regression for race using the following covariates: patient age, gender, and primary language spoken (English, Spanish, or language of Asian origin); the total number of consultations during the study period; the health system; and demographic and economic characteristics of the patient&#8217;s three-digit ZIP code, including percentage non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Asian, Hispanic, under age 18, over age 65, poverty rate, and rural. The demographic and economic characteristics were estimated from the 2019 American Community Survey ZIP code tabulation areas, except for percentage rural, which was from the 2010 Census<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Urban area is defined as incorporated place or territory with at least 2500 residents, based on Census criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We reviewed the imputation model using a validation procedure and undertook a complete case analysis as a robustness check (Supplementary Methods&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Because we were interested in how payment affects providers&#8217; decisions to offer telemedicine, payment parity mandates were determined by the health system&#8217;s state. As the locations of health systems and their associated facilities were unavailable, we assigned each health system to the state where most of its associated patients resided. States with payment parity had statutes or emergency orders requiring telemedicine reimbursement for commercial insurers at the &#8220;same rate&#8221; or &#8220;same basis&#8221; as that for in-person services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

We defined two variables using data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation&#8217;s COVID-19 modeling database: the number of days per month a state implemented stay-at-home orders, and a monthly mandate propensity index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The index was constructed first by calculating the length of time that each state had each of the following policy mandates in place: closures of bars, restaurants, gyms, and schools; mask mandates; and gathering restrictions.

While telemedicine use has declined from its pandemic peak, it remained more widely used in early 2023 than in 2019. Despite its promise for expanding health care access in rural regions, telemedicine was consistently used more in urban areas. Telemedicine was frequently used for mental health care and substance use disorder care. Starting in April 2020, telemedicine consultations for mental health corresponded with an overall increase in the provision of mental health care rather than a substitute for in-person care.</p><p id="Par31">We found that mandating parity in reimbursement was associated with higher telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a substantial pre-pandemic baseline, data that capture all types of patients and care, and a period of study that extends into 2023, our study provides more generalizable evidence than existing studies that similarly find payment parity policies were associated with more telehealth visits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our study also contributes substantially to understanding disparities associated with parity and telemedicine use: we found that payment parity mandates were associated with larger increases for systems in urban areas among systems with a higher proportion of racial and ethnic minority patients. White and AAPI patients switched to telemedicine more rapidly than patients of other race/ethnicities at the beginning of the pandemic, suggesting initial gaps in provision of telemedicine by health systems who primarily serve Black, Hispanic, and AI/AN populations, as well as demand barriers such as insurance status, broadband access and language ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The reimbursement parity regulations may have created a stable environment for health care practices to continue investing in telemedicine technologies and systems and led to more sustained telemedicine use, particularly for smaller systems that have fewer resources. Given that telemedicine use was higher in urban areas, these mandates may reinforce disparities in telemedicine use, however.</p><p id="Par32">These findings have several important policy implications. First, telemedicine usage is likely to continue to persist at higher levels into the future than prior to the pandemic. This is especially true for mental health and substance use disorder care, where telemedicine was a key mechanism through which care was delivered. Our study is the first to show that mental health and substance use disorder care were the most commonly provided services via telemedicine through 2023 for a population comparable to users nationwide, extending existing studies similarly showing increases in mental health care utilization corresponded with a rise in telemedicine care during the pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The question going forward is how effective this modality of care is for these disorders and whether a growing reliance on telemedicine for mental health care may eventually disadvantage populations in need in rural areas.</p><p id="Par33">A second important policy question is thus how telemedicine policies can avoid exacerbating inequities in healthcare access. We found that payment parity policies were most effective in increasing telemedicine use among urban populations and small health systems, leaving populations in rural areas behind. Prior cross-sectional studies similarly found lower telemedicine use in rural versus urban areas, but no difference in the willingness to use telemedicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. As payment parity policies alone do not appear sufficient in increasing telemedicine access in rural areas, future research should investigate which policies, such as expanding broadband networks or increasing digital literacy, could dismantle barriers to telemedicine in rural areas. A comparative perspective with telemedicine trends and disparities in other countries could offer valuable insights into best practices and innovative approaches in different health systems as they become available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">This study has several limitations. First, using the EHR data, we are not able to evaluate the quality of care provided via telemedicine versus in-person care. While telemedicine may expand access, there may also be declines in the quality of patient&#8211;provider interactions. This likely depends on the type of conditions&#8212;telemedicine may be well-suited for mental health services and chronic disease management, for instance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Future research should investigate how patient outcomes differ with expanded use of telemedicine.</p><p id="Par35">Second, because we are assuming the state a health system is located in&#160;based on patient location, there may be measurement error with respect to treatment assignment, in accidentally assigning some systems to states that do not reflect the correct payment parity assignment. This error would underestimate the association of parity on telemedicine usage; therefore, our findings are likely a conservative estimate. Third, we are unable to track patients across health systems or assess whether they sought additional health care outside of the included health systems. Fourth, our data, while large and covering most states in the U.S., is a convenience sample and not representative. Finally, while we implemented a rigorous design that controls for many potential confounders, unobserved covariates may still confound the association between parity polices and telemedicine provision.</p><p id="Par36">Our study underscores the post-pandemic persistence of heightened telemedicine use, with disparities across racial, ethnic, and geographical lines. We also discern a nuanced impact of payment parity policies, benefiting smaller, more urban, and more racially and ethnically diverse systems. Strategies beyond payment parity are needed to boost rural telemedicine usage as the US grapples with nationwide health system changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
