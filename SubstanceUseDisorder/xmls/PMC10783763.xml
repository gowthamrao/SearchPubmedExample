Providers are in a unique position to impact this issue as they both obtain and enter this data, however, the variability in screening and documentation practices currently limits the ability to mobilize SEDH data for secondary uses. This study explores whether providers&#8217; perceptions of clinical importance of SEDH or EHR usability influenced data entry by analyzing two relationships: (1) provider charting behavior and clinical consideration of SEDH and (2) provider charting behavior and ease of EHR use in charting. We performed a cross-sectional study using an 11-question electronic survey to assess self-reported practices related to clinical consideration of SEDH elements, EHR usability and SEDH documentation of all staff physicians, identified using administrative listserves, at Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center during September to October 2021. A total of 201 physicians responded to and completed the survey out of a possible 2,478 identified staff physicians (8.1% response rate). A five-point Likert scale from &#8220;never&#8221; to &#8220;always&#8221; assessed charting behavior and clinical consideration. Responses were dichotomized as consistent/inconsistent and vital/not vital respectively. EHR usability was assessed as &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; responses. Fisher&#8217;s exact tests assessed the relationship between charting behavior and clinical consideration and to compare charting practices between different SEDHs. Cumulative measures were constructed for consistent charting and ease of charting. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) compared SDH and EDH with respect to each cumulative measure and was quantified using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our results show that provider documentation frequency of an SEDH is associated with perceived clinical utility as well as ease of charting and that providers were more likely to consistently chart on SDH versus EDH. Nuances in these relationships did exist with one notable example comparing the results of smoking (SDH) to infectious disease outbreaks (EDH). Despite similar percentages of physicians reporting that both smoking and infectious disease outbreaks are vital to care, differences in charting consistency and ease of charting between these two were seen. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that SEDH quality optimization efforts cannot consider physician perceptions and EHR usability as siloed entities and that EHR design should not be the only target for intervention. The associations found in this study provide a starting point to understand the complexity in how clinical utility and EHR usability influence charting consistency of each SEDH element, however, further research is needed to understand how these relationships intersect at various levels in the SEDH data optimization process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The widespread use of the electronic health record (EHR) in 2009 has accelerated the use of technology in clinical care. However, the current infrastructure of the EHR poses several barriers to effectively accommodate social and environmental determinants of health related to a patient&#8217;s clinical care. Here, we sought to understand the relationship between provider perceptions of clinical importance of various social and environmental determinants of health as well as ease of charting these in the EHR on frequency of documentation of these determinants. We found that while participants reported that social and environmental determinants of health were important for their patient&#8217;s care, this did not always influence their documentation practices of those determinants. Less than half of participants stated that documentation of determinants was easy however, certain determinants seemed to be &#8220;easier&#8221; than others. Additionally, the likelihood of documenting a specific determinant of health may be influenced by whether related determinants are also documented by a provider. Our study provides preliminary evidence that documentation frequency may depend on physician perceptions of health determinant integration into care delivery as well as EHR usability.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data used in this submission was collected via a secure REDCap survey at Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Health.

Determinants of health include settings in which people are born, live, learn, work and age [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Healthy People 2030 Initiative and The County Health Rankings Model, provide organizational schemas for health determinants [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These health frameworks help provide guidance on what data to capture but limitations do exist. For example, misclassification biases can result from using community level data due to limited stored environmental data points in health system EHRs. Lacking is an established standardized set of determinants or method of capture [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to inform care delivery and optimization efforts.</p><p>Providers are in a unique position to influence the quality of determinants data within the EHR as they both acquire necessary elements from screening and record information [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Provider engagement (documenting, reviewing and updating information) with EHR health determinants data is associated with reduced hospital readmission rates; unfortunately, these provider behaviors appear reduced for health determinants as compared to other medical history components [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Data quality relies on accuracy and completeness [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and issues including inaccuracy and incompleteness have been identified with determinants of health data [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], consistent with the notion that the usability of EHR data is generally poor [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Structured data entry can facilitate data use and exchange [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but providers often use non-structured formats to record health determinants information [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which may be more difficult to extract for secondary use. Structured data entry may negatively impact clinical workflows [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and negative EHR user experiences in general may result in partial data capture [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, provider collection and capture may be modifiable; those who care for vulnerable populations or routinely use social care services are more likely to engage with EHR determinants data [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Whether data quality issues are related to incomplete entry, incomplete capture or a lack of universal guidelines is unclear from the existing literature.</p><p>The social elements of health determinants include housing, food security, transportation, utilities, childcare, stable employment, education, financial stability, personal safety, access to guns in the household, insurance, smoking and refugee status [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the purposes of this study, these above elements will be considered as social determinants of health (SDH). Given the amassing evidence of environmental influencers on wellness and disease [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] an expanded set of environmental elements of health determinants will be used and include air pollution, household pollution and toxicities, extreme weather, access to basic appliances, exposure to natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and proximity to landfills/industrial centers/waste processing plants. For the purposes of this study, these above elements will be considered as environmental determinants of health (EDH) and were compiled based on Healthy People 2030 [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Together, SDH and EDH will be considered under the term social and environmental determinants of health (SEDH) for this study. SEDH data quality and mobilization depends on collection and storage, two tasks performed by providers whose engagement with SEDH data may be modifiable. Our team was therefore interested in exploring whether providers&#8217; perceptions of clinical importance or EHR usability influenced data entry. The objective of this study was to identify two possible relationships at an academic medical center: (1) the relationship between provider self-reported charting behavior and self-reported clinical consideration of SEDH and (2) the relationship between provider self-reported charting behavior and self-reported ease of EHR use in charting SEDH. We relied on self-reported charting behavior because routine structured data entry of SEDH elements was limited at the study institution and because we did not want to exclude any possible provider SEDH documentation modality. We hypothesize that for each individual SEDH element, the frequency of charting would be positively correlated with the frequency of clinical consideration as well as the ease of EHR use. We analyzed our data by looking at each individual SEDH element, accounted for an expanded set of EDHs, and analyzed for documentation behaviors related to groups of determinants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>We performed a cross-sectional study using an electronic survey to assess self-reported practices related to clinical consideration of SEDH elements, EHR usability and SEDH documentation of all staff physicians at Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center during September to October 2021.

The GLMM used a binary distribution with a logit link and consisted of a fixed type effect (SDH vs. EDH) and random physician effect to account for correlation between the SDH and EDH responses per physician. The results from the GLMM were quantified using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the study institution granted exempt status for this research (#STUDY00018033).

The percentage of physicians charting on food security (SDH) was higher for those who charted on transportation (SDH) compared to those who did not (34.4% vs. 5.9%, p &lt; 0.001). The percentage charting on access to guns in the household (SDH) was higher for those who charted on personal safety (SDH) compared to those who did not (50.0% vs. 8.4%, p &lt; 0.001). The percentage charting on refugee status (SDH) was higher for those who charted on exposure to natural disasters (EDH) compared to those who did not (100% vs. 7.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, the percentage charting on household pollution and toxicities (EDH) was higher for those who charted on housing (SDH) compared to those who did not (18.2% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.006).</p><p>A majority of physicians consistently charted on at least 1 SDH (88.1%), whereas fewer charted on at least 1 EDH (34.3%). The odds of consistently charting on at least 1 SDH were 14 times the odds of charting on at least 1 EDH (OR = 14.8, 95% CI (8.8, 24.9), p &lt; .001). More than half (68.2%) of physicians reported that at least 1 SDH was easy to chart, compared to 18.4% of physicians who reported ease in charting at least 1 EDH. The odds of easily charting at least 1 SDH were 10 times the odds of easily charting at least 1 EDH (OR = 10.8, 95% CI (6.7, 17.5), p &lt; .001).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p>Generally, our data supports our hypothesis that frequency of charting of an SEDH is associated with physician perception of clinical importance or EHR usability, however, not every association measured in our study showed statistical significance. Regarding all SDHs, charting frequency was significantly associated with physician perception of clinical importance. Charting frequency was significantly associated with ease of charting for all SDHs except for housing, transportation, utilities, education, financial stability, personal safety, and access to guns. However, trends in the raw data for these SDHs do show that a higher percentage of physicians consistently charted SDHs if they perceived charting to be easy (<xref rid="pdig.0000428.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The lack of statistical significance could be likely due to the low overall numbers of respondents who reported that SDH charting was easy. With regards to EDH, charting frequency was significantly associated with physician perception of clinical importance for infectious disease outbreaks and access to basic appliances only. Charting frequency was significantly associated with ease of charting for the EDH of infectious disease outbreaks only. However, just as with SDH, trends in the raw EDH data do show that a higher percentage of physicians consistently charted on EDHs if they perceived the EDH to be vital or easy to chart (<xref rid="pdig.0000428.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Lack of statistical significance for EDH associations is likely due to the overall low numbers of those who reported consistently charting on EDH.</p><p>Overall, 43%-87% of physicians considered an SDH as vital to their patient care with 9 out of the 13 SDHs assessed being considered vital by over half of respondents. Unsurprising, smoking was considered to be the most vital SDH. Assessing for smoking status is deeply entrenched across all levels of medical training and therefore, the high rates of clinical consideration and consistent charting of this SDH was not surprising. What was notable was that the reported ease of charting for smoking was also higher than most other SDHs and EDHs (<xref rid="pdig.0000428.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Systematized use of electronic screening forms, such as PRAPARE, was not a standardized practice at the study institution and provider SEDH documentation may vary between different physicians. Regardless of this possible variation (using structured data entry or an unstructured form like a clinical note) a physician would have been able to use their same chosen method to chart on all SEDHs. It is surprising, therefore, to see in our data a difference in the reported ease of charting for smoking as compared to all other SEDHs. Our data suggests that for the SDH of smoking, charting difficulty was less of an issue despite the fact that the process for charting on smoking would have been the same as for any other SDH or EDH for a particular provider. From our data, it is unclear if the perception of EHR usability for smoking documentation was influenced by medical training of smoking screening. This does, however, pose an interesting question about whether downstream SEDH data quality issues can be modulated from upstream factors in the medical training of providers such as emphasizing SEDH screening [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or actively integrating SEDH into care delivery [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As compared to SDH, a similar percentage of physicians (42&#8211;80%) considered an EDH as vital to their patient care with 3 out of 7 being considered vital by over half of respondents. Though the EDH of infectious disease outbreaks was considered to be the most vital to practice (80%) as compared to all other EDHs, the relatively low rates of consistent charting of this EDH (31%) was surprising given that our survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Less than half of physicians in all departments (with the exception of Psychiatry and Pathology) reported charting on infectious disease outbreaks. It is possible that other members of the care team charted information about the patient&#8217;s infectious disease status or exposure at various points of the patient&#8217;s clinical care. However, the study team would have expected that the provider would have also documented this information either for screening or medical decision-making purposes. As with smoking, the slightly higher reported rates of ease of charting on this EDH suggests that EHR design may not be the only factor that influences physician documentation. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and reported high clinical consideration of infectious disease outbreaks, provider perceptions on EHR usability for documenting infectious disease outbreaks may have been influenced by the various practice changes dictated by the pandemic. Though our data cannot explain why we detected variations between the EDH of infectious disease as compared to the other EDHs, future studies should be undertaken to identify best practices regarding EDH consideration and documentation.</p><p>Our data also highlights some noteworthy associations and behavioral patterns with respect to SEDH data entry. Our results show that SEDH provider documentation is inconsistent: smoking was the only SDH that was consistently charted on by greater than half of physicians and no EDH was consistently charted on by greater than half. This finding is congruent with SEDH data quality issues noted in the literature [<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pdig.0000428.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our data also shows discrepancies in provider considerations between SDH and EDH. The odds of physicians consistently charting on at least one SDH was 14 times the odds of consistently charting on at least one EDH. The odds of easily charting on at least one SDH were 10 times the odds of easily charting on at least one EDH. Despite using an expanded list of EDHs, the low rates of EDH charting or reported ease of charting was likely not due to reduced perceived clinical importance (<xref rid="pdig.0000428.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Finally our results showed statistically significant associations in documenting behavior when grouping certain SEDH elements: (1) there was a higher likelihood to chart on food security if charting on transportation; (2) there was a higher likelihood to chart on access to guns if charting on personal safety; (3) there was a higher likelihood to chart on refugee status if charting on exposure to natural disasters; (4) there was a higher likelihood to chart on household pollution and toxicities if charting on housing. Considering these associations and the imbalance between SDH versus EDH charting practices may help guide interventions targeted towards improving SEDH data quality issues.</p><p>This study has several limitations. We had a low overall response rate of 8% which could lead to non-response bias. This low response resulted in our inability to stratify analyses by medical specialty. It is possible that the low response rate was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic as physician activities were predominantly focused on patient care activities as opposed to research participation during the study period. Second, this study was conducted at a single academic medical center, possibly limiting the generalizability of the results. One advantage of the self-reported data in our study, however, was that we were able to assess for all possible types of charting behaviors and not only rely on discrete elements from structured data entry. Furthermore, physician responses seen in our study corroborated patterns seen in the literature. Finally, we were unable to correlate physician responses to a health system level assessment of SEDH data quality or patient outcomes secondary to low structured documentation modalities and an inability to utilize natural language processing analytics for this particular study.</p><p>In conclusion, our study results show that provider documentation frequency of an SEDH is associated with clinical utility as well as ease of charting and that providers were more likely to consistently chart on SDH versus EDH. There is nuance, however, in these associations. Though a comparable percentage of physicians reported that smoking (SDH) and infectious disease outbreaks (EDH) were vital to care, there were still notable differences in charting consistency and ease of charting between these two. Inconsistent and incomplete acquisition affects the quality and use of SEDH data so understanding the factors that promote or hinder provider capture and entry should be a central consideration in any optimization effort. These efforts however cannot only focus on EHR design or physician perception as siloed entities, as suggested from our results. Instead, it may be more beneficial to approach data quality optimization using a multi-level framework: up-stream factors (examining education and training curricula), care delivery factors (establishing guidelines to systematize collection and storage) and down-stream factors (providing feedback through metrics on clinical use of SEDH elements and documentation practices). Our results provide a starting point to understand how clinical utility and EHR usability influence physician documentation practices for each individual SEDH element. Further research is still needed to explicate these associations at each of these three levels as well as to identify sustainable strategies to improve SEDH data quality and utility.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pdig.0000428.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>REDCap electronic survey.</title><p>First 5 survey items assess basic demographic data, next 3 items assess SDH information (charting behavior, frequency of routine clinical consideration, EHR usability) and last 3 items assess EDH information (charting behavior, frequency of routine clinical consideration, EHR usability).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pdig.0000428.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pdig.0000428.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>REDCap electronic survey raw data file.</title><p>The data used in this submission was collected via a secure REDCap survey at Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Health.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: Dear Editors, </p><p>At first, while reading, and understanding the study conducted, I assessed whether the authors set out and completed what they agreed to do. And, without a doubt, the study is clearly written, and well thought through. While, the auhtors acknowledge their levels of uncertainty, and represent the findings well, one cannot fault them on the basis of a self-reported dataset. </p><p>In future, it would be important to conduct a sub-class analysis of the physicians, and the differences that could potentially be reported by these physicians. Yet, as it stands, the authors provide a rigorous study and coherent argument for the findings in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. The findings account for the differences of whether providers&#8217; perceptions of clinical</p><p>importance of SEDH or EHR usability influenced data entry by analyzing two</p><p>relationships: (1) provider charting behavior and clinical consideration of SEDH and (2)</p><p>provider charting behavior and ease of EHR use in charting. </p><p>Furthermore, as the reviewer, I do acknowledge that this was an exploratory study. However, it would have been useful to include the baseline knowledge of the physicians in the study. Also, how this influence the provider's perceptions of the clinical importance of SEDH and EHR usability. Perhaps, for future purposes, the authors should consider baseline knowledge of the participants, as well as the frequency of entries and how this influence provider charting behaviour and ease of use EHR use in charting.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is a competently written paper but only involves the input from physicians at one academic institution limiting its generalisability. The paper fails to add anything of significant originality to the literature. I would not recommend publication of this paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Comments to authors</p><p>General comments. Overall structure of the manuscript should include sub themes describing the processes carried out during the study. For example under material and methods section, data collection, sampling process and study design has been boxed together. There are component under the study design which should be moved to the introduction section to bring clarity to the stated acronyms</p><p>Introduction</p><p>What are some of the elements of SEDH? Can the authors be clear on what they define as SEDH for readers to appreciate what to expect? Also can the authors clarify what EDH is ? The introduction is not clear on how the providers come to be associated with SEDH and EDH. The manuscript can be improved if the authors state and clarify these issues early. As it stands now, the understanding and interpretation of SEDH and EDH are to the discretion of the reader.</p><p>Although the Objectives of the study are stated clearly, the lack of clarity of SEDH, EDH and how providers are associated with it at the onset, obscures how the stated objectives can be achieved. </p><p>Methods</p><p>Under study design, this should state clearly the study type, when and where it was conducted. The text describing the data collection tools should be captured separately under different subtheme to bring clarity. Again, there should be a section on how data was collected, and the procedures involved to aid understanding how the study was carried out</p><p>Again the part of text under the survey design which defines SEDH, EDH SDH should be moved under the introduction</p><p>How were participants selected or recruited into the study? How was sampling and sample size determined?</p><p>Results</p><p>Line 173-174 the authors states: &#8220; The survey was administered to all physicians at a single academic health center, of which a total of 201 completed the survey&#8230;&#8221; How many physicians were in this facility? What was the response rate? </p><p>Discussion</p><p>Again on Line 353 the authors&#8217; state &#8220;We had a low overall response rate of 8% which&#8230;&#8221; How did the authors arrived at this figure?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>6.
