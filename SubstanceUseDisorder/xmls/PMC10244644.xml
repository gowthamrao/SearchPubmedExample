Introduction</title><p>Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly impact patients' health and quality of life. Housing status is a key SDoH and ending homelessness among United States Veterans is a national priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which provides a breadth of health and housing services for homeless-experienced Veterans (HEVs). To evaluate the effectiveness of VA homeless services, assessing short- and long-term housing outcomes is essential. However, to date, most studies that assess housing outcomes require collecting repeated patient-reported measures of housing status, which are costly and challenging to obtain.</p><p>In VA and other integrated healthcare systems, the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a potentially valuable source of data regarding longitudinal housing outcomes. However, using EHR data for this purpose is challenging due to measurement error, missing data, and other complexities (Botsis et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wells et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Glicksberg et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) which can bias outcomes assessed using longitudinal analyses (Lin et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Pullenayegum and Lim, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Lokku et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). SDoH are often recorded in the EHR using free-text clinical narratives (Organization, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gundlapalli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Peterson and Gundlapalli, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Conway et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Hatef et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Lybarger and Yetisgen, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Tsai et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), and several studies have developed methods for extracting housing data from clinical texts (Gundlapalli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Conway et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Hatef et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Lybarger and Yetisgen, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). In VA, one such system is Relative Housing Stability in Electronic Documentation (ReHouSED) (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system developed to extract housing stability from the EHR to evaluate VA's homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing program. ReHouSED demonstrated higher validity for identifying homeless status compared to International Classification of Diseases 10<sup>th</sup> Edition (ICD-10) codes, a set of standardized codes representing clinical diagnoses and symptoms published by the World Health Organization (Organization, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>However, there are several challenges in applying ReHouSED to study housing outcomes. First, the system may need to be adjusted for particular patient cohorts or evaluating specific services. It was originally designed for HEVs engaged in a rapid rehousing program; HEVs enrolled in other homeless services may have different EHR note structures or linguistic patterns. Second, missing data may cause bias when using ReHouSED for measuring outcomes. Information is only recorded in the EHR when patients present for care, which may occur more frequently for some patients than others. This produces observations at highly irregular intervals rather than the fixed, regularly spaced assessments that are ideal for longitudinal data collection, which can lead to biased analyses unless methods account for missing data (Pullenayegum and Lim, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Lokku et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Third, measurement error is ubiquitous in studies that use EHR data, particularly when using NLP to extract information from complex free text. While NLP is often designed to improve upon the shortcomings of structured data, misclassification is still present. This is especially true for complex variables such as longitudinal housing outcomes.</p><p>In the rapid rehousing context, ReHouSED achieved moderate accuracy (average positive predictive value and sensitivity of 65.3 and 68.1, respectively) and expert annotators achieved modest inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.7) (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), demonstrating the complexity of the task. The accuracy of housing status classification can potentially be improved by combining NLP classifications with other EHR variables (e.g., ICD-10 codes) (Gundlapalli et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Peterson and Gundlapalli, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tsai et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). However, the accuracy of these data elements, as well as the best combination of indices, is not well-studied, in part due to the challenge of constructing a reference standard.</p><p>We aimed to develop a &#8220;best practice&#8221; for assessing longitudinal housing instability using observational EHR data as part of a quality improvement initiative targeting VA's Grant and Per Diem (GPD) case management aftercare program (hereafter, &#8220;Aftercare&#8221;). In this program, VA partners with community-based homeless service agencies to provide 6 months of case management for HEVs undergoing housing transitions (e.g., from institutional settings to independent housing). For a cohort of Aftercare patients in Southern California, we collected patient-reported housing history for a 2-year period. We then extracted six indicators of housing instability from the VA EHR: clinical note classifications of housing status obtained using ReHouSED tailored for this cohort (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>); ICD-10 codes for homelessness; notations of homeless service use found in outpatient visits; inpatient admissions associated with homelessness (e.g., residential treatment programs); a universal screening tool to assess housing instability; and data from VA's homeless registry. We compare the validity of each indicator of housing instability, considering the patient-reported data as a gold standard, and discuss implications for evaluations of housing interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1. Setting and ethics</title><p>Our cohort consisted of 386 VA Greater Los Angeles patients who engaged in Aftercare between 10/1/2019 and 1/4/2021. This cohort was enrolled in a parent project evaluating the implementation of Critical Time Intervention, an evidence-based, structured, and time-limited case management practice (Herman et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gabrielian et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). All project activities were reviewed by VA's Central Institutional Review Board and designated as quality improvement.</p><p>We extracted patient demographics for the entire cohort including age, race, and ethnicity from administrative data collected as part of Aftercare. Additionally, we identified recent diagnoses of psychiatric and substance use disorders using ICD-10 diagnosis codes derived from the VA's National Psychosis Registry (Blow et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We included the following conditions in our analysis: alcohol use disorders; drug use disorders; schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar disorders; major depressive disorder; anxiety disorders; and post-traumatic stress disorders. The complete list of ICD-10 codes can be found in the <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>. Of note, we did not assess for the presence of dementia or other major neurocognitive disorders (exclusion criteria from the housing program in which this cohort was engaged); mental retardation (which is incompatible with military service); or personality disorders (which are inaccurately captured in VA administrative data). Diagnosis codes were retrieved from outpatient and inpatient settings in the year preceding the patient lookback period (defined in the following paragraph).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Patient-reported housing outcomes</title><p>We recruited a random subsample of 61 patients from the cohort for detailed telephone assessments of their housing status from 7/1/2020 and 6/30/2022. The goal was to create a reference standard to enable refinement of EHR methodologies for assessing housing status. We sent recruitment letters to 188 randomly selected Veterans, 19 of whom opted into the study. 158 of the remaining Veterans received follow-up recruitment calls and 41 volunteered to participate.</p><p>Following verbal informed consent, assessments were conducted with the Residential Time-Line Follow Back (TLFB) inventory, a validated instrument that collects retrospective housing status (Mendelson et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The TLFB assigns codes for 34 different housing types (e.g., &#8220;On the street or in other outdoor place,&#8221; &#8220;Own apartment or house&#8221;) and classifies each type to one of four categories: &#8220;Literal Homelessness,&#8221; &#8220;Temporary,&#8221; &#8220;Stable,&#8221; and &#8220;Institutional.&#8221; In these analyses, we collapsed &#8220;Literal Homelessness&#8221; and &#8220;Temporary Housing&#8221; into a single &#8220;Unstable&#8221; category. Except for inpatient admissions coded as &#8220;Hospital (medical only),&#8221; any &#8220;Institutional&#8221; code was also considered to be &#8220;Unstable.&#8221; This meant that short-term institutional facilities, such as residential programs or crisis housing, were considered unstable.</p><p>Using standardized TLFB procedures, participants reported all changes in housing status over the specified period. We defined patient episodes as a continuous period spent &#8220;stable&#8221; or &#8220;unstable.&#8221; For example, patients who were stably housed during the entire period had a single episode (even if they changed addresses or moved to a different subcategory of stable housing), whereas a patient who was stably housed at the beginning of the period but then became unstably housed for the rest of the period had two episodes.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. EHR indicators of housing status</title><p>EHR data for all patients in this subsample was obtained from VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), a national repository of demographics, diagnoses, clinical narratives, and other clinical and administrative data. Additional data was retrieved from the VA's homeless service registry and linked to CDW data.</p><sec><title>2.3.1. NLP system</title><p>We used ReHouSED to extract housing status from clinical notes in the subset of patients who completed telephone interviews (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). ReHouSED is a rule-based system implemented in medspaCy (Eyre et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) that was originally developed to extract housing outcomes from HEVs participating in VA's rapid rehousing program. Rules are hand-crafted to define semantic phrase and syntactic patterns, matching entities related to homelessness (e.g., &#8220;sleeps in the park,&#8221; &#8220;needs shelter&#8221;) and housing stability (e.g., &#8220;lives in an apartment,&#8221; &#8220;no concerns about housing&#8220;). Each entity is then linked to any linguistic modifiers such as phrases indicating negation (e.g., &#8220;not currently&#8221;) or risk (e.g., &#8220;worried about being evicted&#8221;). Notes are also parsed to identify the clinical note sections, such as past medical history or social history. This contextual information is used to interpret whether each entity is referring to the patient's current housing status and whether they are stably housed. Based on text in a note, each note is assigned one of three housing status classifications: &#8220;Stable,&#8221; &#8220;Unstable,&#8221; or &#8220;Unknown.&#8221; The last of these classifications refers to notes that include some mention of housing or discussion of a patient's history of housing instability but have no discernible statement of the patient's current housing status. Examples of documents classified as &#8220;Unstable&#8221; and &#8220;Stable,&#8221; respectively, are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> A clinical note classified by ReHouSED as &#8220;Unstable.&#8221; The note states that the patient is living in a hotel and hopes to move into stable housing soon.

First, we identified clinical note templates and phrases related to the receipt of VA permanent supportive housing services (independent housing with financial subsidies and supportive services). Though ReHouSED initially classified permanent supportive housing as &#8220;Unstable,&#8221; we conceptualized permanent supportive housing as a positive (&#8220;Stable&#8221;) outcome for Aftercare patients. Second, while ReHouSED prioritized mentions of stable housing over mentions of homelessness or temporary housing in a clinical note, we modified the document classification logic to prioritize current mentions of VA's residential treatment program for HEVs (known as the Domiciliary); for HEVs engaged in Aftercare, enrollment in residential treatment was considered a negative (&#8220;Unstable&#8221;) outcome. Last, based on a review of this sample of notes, we added a small number of additional concepts that were not included in the original ReHouSED system (e.g., &#8220;currently incarcerated,&#8221; &#8220;sober home&#8221;).</p><p>We processed all notes mentioning housing keywords for interviewed patients during the 2-year assessment period. The housing keywords and additional exclusion criteria are the same as those described by Chapman et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). If multiple notes mentioning housing were present on a single day, we classified the encounter as &#8220;Unstable&#8221; if at least half of the notes were classified as &#8220;Unstable&#8221; after excluding &#8220;Unknown&#8221; notes. If fewer than half were classified as &#8220;Unstable,&#8221; or if there were no notes classified as &#8220;Stable&#8221; or &#8220;Unstable,&#8221; the housing status that day was deemed &#8220;Stable.&#8221;</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.2. Structured EHR data</title><p>We abstracted demographic data (age, gender, race, ethnicity) from the EHR. We also obtained structured EHR data elements that indicate housing instability: ICD-10 codes for behavioral health disorders (psychiatric diagnoses and substance use disorders); outpatient administrative data that indicate receipt of homeless services; inpatient administrative data that describe admission to programs for HEVs; and a homelessness screening tool. Each data element is detailed below. Specific value sets for each data element are provided in the <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental material</xref>.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">ICD-10 codes:</italic> Several ICD-10 codes associated with outpatient visits or inpatient care indicate homelessness or risk of homelessness (e.g., &#8220;Z59.0: Homelessness, unspecified&#8221;). We retrieved all ICD-10 codes pertaining to homelessness or risk of homelessness during the study period. We conceptualized a patient as unstable if there was a homeless-associated ICD-10 code on a given day.</p><p>Outpatient administrative data: In VA EHR, the type of outpatient clinical service is coded. We identified codes indicating use of VA homeless services and considered an encounter unstable if the Veteran received care from any of these services.</p><p>Inpatient administrative: For all hospital stays in the study cohort, we identified residential treatment programs for HEVs (conceptualized as inpatient admissions in VA, e.g., the &#8220;Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV) program&#8221;).</p><p>Homelessness screener: The Homelessness Screening Clinical Reminder (HSCR) is an instrument delivered to all Veteran outpatients to routinely screen for recent housing instability or risk of housing instability (Montgomery et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Responses to this screener are saved in the EHR as structured data elements. We identified positive responses from interviewed Veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.3. Homeless service registry data</title><p>The VA maintains an administrative database of homeless services provided to Veterans by the VA or its community partners, referred to as the homeless service registry (HOMES). We queried this database for enrollment and exit dates into housing assistance programs and considered patients to be unstably housed during their enrollment period.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.4. Analyses</title><sec><title>2.4.1. TLFB data</title><p>Using TLFB data, we calculated the count, percent of episodes, and total person-days spent in each of three categories: unstable, stable, and institutional. Because days spent in institutional settings (e.g., hospital admissions not related directly to homelessness) were expected to be uncommon and captured using inpatient administrative data, episodes assigned to this category were excluded from further analyses. We also derived a binary variable indicator whether the patient reported housing instability at any point in the 2-year assessment period. We measured the association between housing instability at any point with baseline characteristics (i.e., demographic variables and psychiatric diagnoses) using a logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4.2. VA service use frequency and type</title><p>Analyses using EHR data depend on documentation of patients' service use, leading to missing data on days when patients are not engaged with the VA health system. To assess patterns of service utilization and corresponding rates of missingness, we calculated descriptive statistics of the frequency of encounters, defined as any inpatient or outpatient service documented in the EHR. We calculated the count and proportion of patients, person-days, and person-months with at least one encounter in VA during the data collection period. We also calculated the mean and standard deviation of the number of encounters per month. To assess the number of clinical notes discussing housing, we repeated each calculation limited to encounters that contained notes classified by ReHouSED as &#8220;Stable&#8221; or &#8220;Unstable.&#8221; To explore whether rates of encounter frequency differed between stably and unstably housed individuals, which could cause bias in longitudinal analyses, we stratified these statistics by whether they were ever unstably housed during the data collection period. We visually characterized encounter frequency in these two groups by plotting encounters over time using an abacus plot (Lokku et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.4.3. Validity of EHR indicators</title><p>We assessed the accuracy of each individual EHR indicator for differentiating stable vs. unstable housing. First, we calculated the proportion of ever unstably housed and never unstably housed patients who had each indicator. Indicators found to be present for less than two unstably housed patients were excluded from subsequent analyses. For the remaining indicators, we calculated encounter- and month-level sensitivity and specificity for each indicator. For encounter-level performance, we calculated sensitivity as the proportion of encounters during an episode of unstable housing where that indicator was present, and specificity as the proportion of encounters during stable episodes that did not have the indicator. We considered each of the EHR indicators individually as well as different combinations of EHR indicators (e.g., NLP and ICD-10 codes denoting housing instability). Bootstrapping was used to construct 90% confidence intervals.</p><p>A limitation of measuring the performance of EHR indicators at the encounter level is that many VA visits may not include documentation of a patient's housing status. For example, visits for medical/surgical procedures generally do not include documentation of housing status and would be counted as false negatives in the encounter-level sensitivity. To account for this, we first limited the data to encounters where the patient had at least one note classified as &#8220;Stable&#8221; or &#8220;Unstable&#8221; by ReHouSED; this required an explicit NLP classification of housing status and does not equate the absence of documented unstable housing to stable housing. Second, we aggregated data to patient-months. For each patient, the patient's housing status was considered unstable if he/she reported an episode of unstable housing that overlapped with that month. A patient-month was classified as unstable if at least half of a patient's encounters during that time had indicators of instability. This month-level analysis was limited to patient-months that had at least one VA service use.</p><p>Unlike EHR data, the HOMES data records start and end dates of service use, removing the need for a patient to present for medical care to ascertain their housing status. To compare HOMES vs. EHR data, we restricted HOMES records to days in which patients had an EHR-recorded encounter, but separately calculated the total proportion of person-days (with or without an encounter) captured using HOMES data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3.

EHR encounters</title><p>Most (58) patients had an encounter at some point over the 2 years. Patients who experienced unstable housing had more encounters per month compared to patients who remained stably housed (mean 7.0 vs. 5.1, ratio = 1.37). Limiting to encounters with notes mentioning housing, this ratio increased slightly (mean 3.6 vs. 2.4, ratio = 1.5). Similarly, patients with unstable housing experiences had a higher probability of having at least one encounter in a given month. This difference in visit frequency is shown visually in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, which plots visit frequency over the 1st year of the study period for a randomly selected subsample of 12 patients with no unstable housing (top panel) and the 12 patients who reported unstable housing (bottom).

Validity of EHR indicators</title><p>Of the 12 patients who reported at least one unstably housed experience on the TLFB, 11 (91.6%) had some documentation of unstable housing over the assessment period, while 1 (8.4%) did not have any data elements indicating housing instability. NLP, ICD-10 codes, and outpatient administrative data were each present for all of these 11 patients, while the inpatient variables and the homelessness screener were each used with only 1 patient. Most (8/12, 66.7%) patients with unstable housing experiences were recorded in HOMES as having received homeless services.</p><p>We examined encounter- and month-level sensitivity and specificity for NLP, ICD-10 codes, outpatient data, and HOMES, as well as combinations of the structured EHR data and NLP. <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the results for individual indicators, combinations of NLP and ICD-10 codes, and combinations of NLP and any structured data, including VA-specific data elements; data were restricted to person-days and months where the patient had a VA encounter. At the encounter level, NLP displayed higher sensitivity (0.197, bootstrapped 90% CI = [0.143, 0.251]) than ICD-10 codes (0.098 [0.039, 0.157]) and outpatient data (0.102 [0.074, 0.129]), but lower sensitivity than HOMES (0.268 [0.076, 0.459]). Bootstrapped confidence intervals for sensitivity were wide due to the small number of unstably housed patients The widest confidence intervals were observed for HOMES data due to high between-subject variation (i.e., only 66.7% of unstably housed patients were in the registry). Encounter-level specificity was highest for HOMES (0.969 [0.947, 0.990]) and outpatient data (0.967 [0.950, 0.983]), and lower for NLP (0.948 [0.936, 0.960]) and ICD-10 codes (0.943 [0.922, 0.964]).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Sensitivity and specificity, and confidence intervals, for four EHR indicators of unstable housing at the encounter and month level.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr style="background-color:#919498;color:#ffffff"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">

Discussion</title><p>We compared patient-reported housing history with clinical and administrative data regarding housing status for a cohort of homeless-experienced VA patients. Our goal was to compare the validity of different data elements to identify best practices for assessing longitudinal housing outcomes using EHR data. Among the small number of patients who experienced housing instability in our cohort, most had EHR documentation of their housing status. Using NLP to supplement standard structured data elements with information recorded in clinical notes NLP led to more complete assessment of longitudinal housing outcomes. This is an important finding with methodologic implications for optimizing the validity of assessing patients' longitudinal housing outcomes using EHR data when patient-level data collection is not feasible due to sample size or resource constraints.</p><p>In these analyses, sensitivity and specificity varied by EHR extraction method. NLP generally had higher sensitivity than structured EHR data for capturing repeated occurrences of housing instability, but demonstrated lower specificity than some structured elements. ICD-10 codes, which are often used in epidemiologic studies, had lower sensitivity and specificity than most other indicators, including NLP. Combining NLP and ICD-10 codes increased sensitivity but decreased specificity. These findings build on prior work with ReHouSED in a distinct cohort of VA patients engaged in rapid rehousing (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>); at the patient-month level, both analyses provide evidence that ReHouSED performs better than ICD-10 codes in measuring housing instability.</p><p>The VA EHR contains data elements for documenting housing instability that are unique to VA. In particular, outpatient administrative data had higher specificity than NLP and higher sensitivity than ICD-10 codes. Combinations of these three elements could be used to tailor definitions to improve sensitivity or specificity as appropriate for a particular cohort or analysis. Additionally, while encounter- and month-level performance varied across different data elements, patient-level sensitivity was similarly high for NLP, ICD-10 codes, and outpatient administrative data, suggesting structured data may be sufficient for constructing coarse definitions of housing instability (e.g., identifying patients with a history of housing instability at any point in time).</p><p>When patients received services recorded in HOMES, those episodes of housing instability were captured with high sensitivity and specificity. However, this dataset does not capture an important segment of the population that is disengaged from VA homeless services; our data suggests that quality improvement leaders and researchers using HOMES to assess housing outcomes should consider complementing this data with EHR data elements. These findings parallel prior work (Tsai et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) comparing estimated prevalence of homelessness across VA, which found that utilizing multiple EHR data elements can improve ascertainment of housing instability.</p><p>When deciding how to define housing instability using EHR data, we suggest that specific analytic goals and the underlying prevalence of housing instability be taken into consideration. Analyses examining cohorts with low prevalence of housing instability, as we had here, may demand high specificity to avoid large numbers of false positives. Specificity can be improved by requiring multiple data elements to show evidence of housing instability or by favoring more specific data elements. When high sensitivity is more desirable, using NLP or the union of multiple data elements may be more effective. Attention should also be given to missing data, as EHR data depends on patients presenting for care. Patients experiencing housing instability may use care more frequently, leading to an imbalance in the degree of observation for stably and unstably housed patients. To avoid biased results, longitudinal analyses of housing instability using EHR data should consider utilizing methods for adjusting for missing data and irregular observations (Lin et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Pullenayegum and Lim, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Pullenayegum and Scharfstein, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>This work has limitations. First, we performed these exploratory analyses on a small sample and thus our statistical analyses had had low power. Regardless, the detailed patient-reported housing history we obtained over a 2-year period in patients with homeless experiences is a valuable observational dataset and our findings will inform future work. As with any retrospective analyses using patient-reported data, there is a possibility of recall or recruitment bias in our sample. Interviewed patients differed slightly in terms of race/ethnicity (i.e., interviewed patients were more likely to be African-American than the rest of the cohort and less likely to be Hispanic/Latino). They had similar distributions of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses, although the reported proportions only represent patients receiving clinical services related to these conditions and may not be reliable due to the inaccuracy of ICD-10 coding. To check for possible differential housing instability, we compared the EHR documentation of housing instability between interviewed and non-interviewed patients and found the two groups to be similar in terms of the frequency of documented housing instability, offering some assurance against recruitment bias; however, such bias remains a possibility. Second, we treated each indicator of housing instability as dichotomous. However, accuracy may be improved by factoring information such as the number of notes processed by the NLP during a single encounter or different levels of structured data (e.g., ICD-10 codes indicating risk of homelessness vs. literal homelessness). Third, we examined a cohort of VA patients from one geographic area enrolled in a particular housing program. The observed patterns here of housing instability and EHR documentation may not generalize to other cohorts of Veterans or to populations outside of the VA, who demonstrate different demographic characteristics and documentation patterns. However, documentation of housing and other SDoH is common in clinical texts, and ICD-10 codes are widely used across healthcare systems. We demonstrated here that ReHouSED could be tailored for a new cohort and analysis task, and other work has demonstrated the feasibility of customizing NLP systems developed in VA to be applied in other settings (Chapman et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Additionally, this analysis was performed using data from the VA's legacy EHR, VISTA, which is planned to be replaced by Cerner. Future work should compare these findings with data in Cerner to ensure continuing data quality and accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Longitudinal housing status is an important outcome for patients who have experienced homelessness. For a sample of 61 homeless-experienced VA patients enrolled in a case management program, we found that housing status was documented longitudinally in the EHR using several structured and unstructured data elements. Using NLP to extract information from clinical notes can improve sensitivity for assessing housing outcomes, while incorporating multiple EHR indicators of housing instability achieves higher specificity compared to single indicators. Future work could customize ReHouSED for processing clinical texts within and outside VA for distinct patient cohorts, augmented by other EHR elements. Similar approaches could also be employed to evaluate other SDoH variables longitudinally using NLP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because due to the sensitive and protected nature of this data, the authors are unable to make it available to the public.
