Although knowledge and understanding of the insecurity profile of such patients is necessary for targeted care that improves their health outcomes, the concept has not been comprehensively quantified. In this study we explored, characterized, and quantified the social insecurity profile of ED patients at a rural teaching hospital in southeastern North Carolina with a large Native American population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A paper survey questionnaire was administered by trained research assistants between May&#8211;June 2018 to patients who presented to the ED and consented to participate in this cross-sectional, single-center study. The survey was anonymous with no identifying information collected on the respondents. A general demographic section and questions derived from the literature capturing sub-constructs of social insecurity&#8212;communication access, access to transportation, housing insecurity and home environment, food insecurity, and exposure to violence&#8211;were captured in the survey. We assessed the factors included in the index of social insecurity based on a rank ordering using the magnitude of their coefficient of variation and the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha reliability index of the constituent items.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, we collected 312 surveys from the approximately 445 administered and included them in the analysis, representing a response rate of about 70%. The average age of the 312 respondents was 45.1 (&#177;17.7) years with a range of 18.0&#8211;96.0. More females (54.2%) than males participated in the survey. Native Americans (34.3%), Blacks (33.7%), and Whites (27.6%) comprised the three major racial/ethnicity groups of the sample, which are representative of the study area&#8217;s population distribution. Social insecurity was observed among this population regarding all the subdomains and an overall measure (P &lt;.001). We identified three key determinants of social insecurity&#8212;food insecurity, transportation insecurity, and exposure to violence. Social insecurity significantly differed overall and among the three of its key constituent domains by patients&#8217; race/ethnicity and gender (P &lt;.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Emergency department visits in a rural North Carolina teaching hospital are characterized by a diverse patient population, including patients with some degree of social insecurity. Historically marginalized and minoritized groups including Native Americans and Blacks demonstrated overall higher rates of social insecurity and higher indexes on exposure to violence than their White counterparts. Such patients struggle with basic needs such as food, transportation, and safety. As social factors play a critical role in health outcomes, supporting the social well-being of a historically marginalized and minoritized rural community would likely help build the foundation for safe livelihood with improved and sustainable health outcomes. The need for a more valid and psychometrically desirable measurement tool of social insecurity among ED populations is compelling.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Emergency departments (ED) across the United States (U.S.) frequently serve as medical safety nets for marginalized and excluded populations.

Lumberton is the most populated city in Robeson County, which is one of the largest and poorest counties in the state. Robeson County measures 973 square miles, and UNC Southeastern is the sole regional medical center in the county. This rural hospital serves a diverse, medically disinvested, and economically impoverished population. Life expectancy in Robeson County is the lowest of all counties in the state. In 2015 it ranked 100 of 100 counties in &#8220;health factors&#8221; and 95 of 100 counties in &#8220;health outcomes.&#8221;<xref rid="b6-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b21-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additionally, Robeson County is home to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, a state-recognized Native American tribe without federal benefits, which comprises nearly 40% of the population.<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Compared to the U.S. median household income of $63,179 during the study period, the median household income in Robeson County was just $34,976.<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, only 14% of Robeson County residents have achieved an education level of Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher, compared with nearly 33% of the U.S. population.<xref rid="b23-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Population Health Research Capsule</title></caption><p>What do we already know about this issue?</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Social determinants of health critically impact the health outcomes of individuals and communitie</italic>s.</p><p>What was the research question?</p><p><italic toggle="yes">We sought to determine, characterize, and quantify the social insecurity profile of a rural ED patient population</italic>.</p><p>What was the major finding of the study?</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Significant race/ethnicity and gender differences exist between Native Americans/Blacks compared to Whites in three key constituent domains of social insecurity: Food insecurity, transportation insecurity, and exposure to violence.

Additionally, we collected sociodemographic information from the participants. Beyond the five domains listed above, we aimed to identify other nuances of social insecurity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>We generated descriptive statistics, such as frequencies/percentages for categorical variables, and determined means, ranges, and standard deviations for continuous variables. To quantify social insecurity, we constructed a scoring index using items of the sub-domains and an overall score consisting of all the items together. We performed reliability analysis (as measured by the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha) for each item of the sub-domains, and for the overall construct of social insecurity. Furthermore, we used a rank ordering of the factors based on coefficient of variation (CV) in conjunction with the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha to select the factors to be included in the social insecurity index construction. We performed a preliminary multivariate analysis by using the sub-domains as dependent variables and demographics (age, gender, and ethnicity) as independent variables. Following that analysis, we determined statistically significant group differences with respect to continuous variables by using parametric (or non-parametric equivalents where necessary) tests such as analysis of variance (ANOVA), independent samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, and one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test as appropriate. Statistical significance level was set at a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value of of less than 5% for all inferential questions.

Of the 312 respondents, 92.3% lived in Robeson County and 45.8% were male. The race/ethnicity distribution was almost evenly divided between Native American (34.4%), Black (33.7%), and White (27.6). The remainder was Hispanic or &#8220;other.&#8221; It should be noted that this demographic of race/ethnicity distribution of the survey participants/respondents intimately mirrors that of the population of Robeson County.<xref rid="b21-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Domains and Item Analyses of Social Insecurity Manifestations</title><p><xref rid="t2-wjem-24-538" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> outlines the response distribution over the five sub-domains of social insecurity among the respondent patients presenting to the ED of a large, rural teaching medical center. In all, 18 binary-anchored (0=no and 1=yes) items constituted social insecurity across each of the delineated five sub-domains. The items were intentionally calibrated such that a total response score of zero would indicate low while 18 would indicate high as a measure of overall social insecurity. We reverse coded items to correspond to the direction of the core items for consistency of the score&#8212;8 of the 18 items were reverse coded. The reverse coded items were 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12 (refer to <xref rid="t2-wjem-24-538" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For each of the sub-domains the ranges were 0&#8211;3 for communication, housing security and environment, food insecurity; 0&#8211;4 for transportation; and 0&#8211;5 for violence exposure. These ranges defined the number of items that composed each of the sub-domains of the overall social insecurity construct.</p><p>We conducted a reliability analysis on the items within each domain as well as for all the items overall. <xref rid="t3-wjem-24-538" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the results of Cronbach&#8217;s alphas from the reliability analysis of the items in each sub-domain, as well as all the items together (overall). Three of the observed reliabilities and overall were fair and acceptable (Cronbach&#8217;s alpha &#8805; 0.6); however, the negative reliability of the items underlying the communication sub-domain, although problematic, might hold plausible explanations that would be of policy relevance. Furthermore, the relatively low reliability for housing insecurity may need further exploration.</p><p>In <xref rid="t4-wjem-24-538" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the mean of the overall summated social insecurity measure was higher than zero suggesting the presence of perceived social insecurity among the population under study. To account for scaling differences in the constituent number of items, rank ordering of the summated sub-domains from the highest to the least contributing subdomain to overall social insecurity (using CV = standard deviation/mean) yielded the following:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Housing insecurity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Food insecurity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Transportation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exposure to violence</p></list-item><list-item><p>Communication</p></list-item></list><p>Although from the CV ordering, housing insecurity commanded a first place among the five sub-domains, its Cronbach&#8217;s alpha reliability index was not satisfactory: It was lower than the conventionally acceptable value of at least 0.6 for the purpose of this study. Hence, it would not be considered a factor in the quantification of the measurement of social insecurity in the population under study. Communication was the least in the CV ranking with even an unacceptable negative Cronbach&#8217;s alpha value. Thus, examining the results of the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha reliability analysis in tandem with the CV ordering, the top three factors of the five constituting social insecurity would be as follows: <bold>exposure to violence</bold>; <bold>transportation</bold>; and <bold>food insecurity</bold>&#8212;in relative increasing order of importance.</p></sec><sec><title>Age, Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Social Insecurity</title><p>In an initial multivariate analysis involving demographic variables age, gender, and race/ethnicity, age did not significantly predict any of the three social insecurity sub-domains. Following up using an ANOVA, we observed statistically significant differences among the three major ethnicity classifications of the population under study, namely Native American, Black, and White, regarding social insecurity overall and for each of the three key sub-domains&#8212;exposure to violence, transportation insecurity, and food insecurity. Native Americans/Alaska Natives and Blacks on average did not show a statistically significant difference in their index score of overall social insecurity (P=.79). However, Whites had on average, a statistically significant lower measure of social insecurity than American Indians/Alaska Natives (P&lt; .001) and Blacks (P=.004). The results for the sub-domain of exposure to violence were similar; no statistically significant difference was observed between Native Americans/Alaska Natives and Blacks (P=1). However, statistically significant differences were observed between Whites and Native Americans/Alaska Natives (P&lt;.001), and Blacks (P=.001). Whites on average had a lower index of exposure to violence than the other two race/ethnicity categories. On transportation insecurity, there was only a statistically significant difference between Native Americans/Alaska Natives and Whites (P=.03) with the former showing a higher index compared to the latter. Food insecurity yielded similar results, but in this case, the difference was between Whites and Blacks (P=.04).</p><p>Similarly, gender differences were observed for the overall measure of social insecurity as well as the three key sub-domains&#8212;exposure to violence, transportation, and food insecurity. Males on average than females exhibited higher overall social insecurity (P&lt;.001). The same was true for exposure to violence (P&lt;.001) and transportation insecurity (P=.004), but no statistically significant difference in food insecurity (P=.59) was observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we sought to determine, characterize, and quantify the most common elements of the social landscape that are associated with the patient population of this rural ED.

Food insecurity was the topmost factor identified, followed by transportation availability, and exposure to violence.</p><p>Prior research suggests that rural residents of the western and southern US experience more food insecurity than their counterparts in other regions.<xref rid="b29-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b31-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Likewise, historically marginalized and minoritized populations incur higher rates of food insecurity than other groups.<xref rid="b29-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b31-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The rates of food insecurity in Robeson County were nearly twice the state average and more than double the national average.<xref rid="b29-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Although most respondents (88.1%) affirmed that they have access to healthy foods, a high proportion of them (27%) reported running out of food due to lack of money or reducing/skipping meals due to budget constraints. Interestingly, reported food insecurity was associated with higher rates of crime (ever having been robbed, threatened with a gun, or shot) than those without reported food insecurity.<xref rid="b32-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Transportation availability or access emerged as the second topmost source of social insecurity in this population. Subjects were surveyed on this topic to explore their ability to obtain outpatient specialty care when not available in Robeson County. As a rural, medically underserved county, many medical specialties are not available within Robeson County. It is not uncommon for ED patients to require outpatient follow-up with a specialist located at a distant urban area. Despite a high proportion (87.8%) reporting that they had reliable transportation within the county, over 30% did not have a valid driver&#8217;s license. Furthermore, 22.5% reported not having had reliable transportation to appointments, up to three hours away, outside the county. These findings highlight transportation barriers to obtaining healthcare within the population.</p><p>The third topmost factor contributing to social insecurity in the study population was exposure to violence. Our results suggest that many respondents had been victims of burglary and larceny: 28.5% reported a prior home robbery. In fact, the crime rate in Robeson County is consistently one of the highest in the country.<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b23-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Compared to urban Wake County, rates of violent crimes in Robeson County are nearly four times higher. Violent crime rates in Robeson County during the study dates were nearly triple the national rate.<xref rid="b33-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b34-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>More than one in four respondents (26.9%) affirmed that they had been threatened with a gun, and about 10% reported personally sustaining a gunshot wound. Almost one third (31%) of respondents reported having a family member who had sustained a gunshot wound, and 17.4% reported having a family member die of a gunshot wound. Our results were consistent with prior works that have suggested a higher prevalence of gun violence among poor and minoritized populations than others. The implications of gun violence could be far-reaching. The sequelae of gun violence impact healthcare costs, disability, and mental health for victims and survivors.<xref rid="b18-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b24-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b32-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b34-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Housing insecurity and communication were found to be the least favorable factors, respectively, in the quantitative ranking of the five social insecurity domains examined in this study population. They did not yield basic, desirable, psychometric properties as sub-domains in the overall measure of the social insecurity construct. Nevertheless, they cannot be dismissed as unimportant factors in the SDOH framework. Further research may be warranted in quantifying their relative importance in a more coherent and comprehensive manner for development and measurement of the construct of social insecurity beyond that done in this study.</p><p>Although homelessness did not emerge as a top factor, many respondents in Robeson County had been affected by homelessness&#8212;an integral factor undergirding housing insecurity.<xref rid="b35-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b38-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> With our finding of an affirmative response rate of 11.9%, it was suggestive that housing insecurity is more prevalent in Robeson County than other regions of NC. According to 2018 Continuum of Care data, the state of NC had approximately 8,962 homeless on any given day, representing a rate of 0.08% of a total state population of 10,383,620.<xref rid="b37-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b40-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Nationally, homelessness rates are reported to be 0.17%. It should be noted that our survey questions asked about homelessness over the prior year rather than currently.</p><p>Interestingly, our results suggest that homelessness is a possible risk factor for exposure to crime and gun violence. We observed that homeless respondents reported higher rates of home robbery and gun violence than those who did not report homelessness in the prior year. Of the homeless respondents, 48.6% affirmed that they had ever been robbed, 59.5% ever threatened with a gun, and 21.6% reported having ever been shot with a gun. These numbers were significantly higher on average than those reported in the general population. In fact, these rates were substantially higher than nationally reported rates of violence against homeless persons. The National Coalition for the Homeless reported that in 2016, for example, a total of 122 incidents of violent crime occurred among 578,424 homeless persons&#8212;a nationally reported, violent-crimes prevalence rate of 0.02%.<xref rid="b41-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This rate was in stark contrast to the 21.6% of homeless ED respondents in our study who reported having sustained a gunshot wound and 59.5% who had ever been threatened by a gun.</p><p>Surprisingly, the data suggests that communication by telephone, possessing a government-issued identification card, and having active utilities (water and electricity) in the home were not major challenges faced by the study population. In fact, 85.9% of respondents reported having a personal cell phone. A plausible explanation for the counterintuitive result could be that many respondents likely qualified for low-cost cell phone service such as Lifeline Support for Affordable Communities under a Federal Communications Commission assistance program. This program, at the study time, was available in all 50 states for people whose income level is at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines, and for those who qualified for other federal programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or free public housing assistance.<xref rid="b42-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b44-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Despite high rates of personal cell phone ownership, 21.8% reported times when they did not have access to a phone if needed to make a phone call for health purposes. Notably, a high percentage of participants reported having a government-issued identification card (94.2%), which is required by many healthcare and social institutions. Furthermore, most respondents affirmed that they currently had running water and electricity in their home (98.7%). These results suggest that, although many residents of Robeson County live in poverty, most do not report deficiencies in access to phones and/or utilities.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>Several limitations to this study should be noted. As a consented and convenience sampling survey, respondents may have been different from those who did not consent to participate. Consequently, a self-selection bias leading to more socially desirable responses was possible. Moreover, critically ill patients or those who presented with acute complaints were excluded. There was no way to force or coerce non-participants for any information, even their basic demographic information. Hence, we could only state this lack of comparison between participants and non-participants as a study limitation serving as a caution for the interpretation of the results.</p><p>Furthermore, participants were not screened for literacy. It is possible that a small number of illiterate participants did not seek verbal assistance from the RAs and provided unreliable responses. Moreover, the instrument used in this study did not demonstrate foolproof, desirable psychometric properties, and no general population sub-domain means existed for context of comparisons and benchmarking. Hence, it was difficult to benchmark a meaningful measure of &#8220;insecurity&#8221; exactly and realistically with established cut-off points. Additionally, non-English speaking patients were excluded from participation. According to US census data, 7.9% of households in Robeson County speak a language other than English in the home.<xref rid="b22-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is plausible that non-English speaking status could be a factor associated with social insecurity, and this could be an area of future research.</p><p>While participants were not surveyed on income level or insurance status, race/ethnicity is a known factor associated with income levels and health insurance status/rates in the US.<xref rid="b40-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b41-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Prior works have noted large and pervasive differences over time in income by race/ethnicity, with Whites accruing higher incomes than Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.<xref rid="b40-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Additionally, Whites have lower rates of uninsured persons compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The rates of uninsured non-Hispanic Blacks are nearly double the rate of uninsured Whites, and the rate of uninsured Hispanics is nearly four times higher than that of Whites.<xref rid="b41-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b43-wjem-24-538" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Demographic data from the study population, and Robeson County in general, suggests that poverty and lack of health insurance likely contribute to social insecurity in the study population. Finally, although the survey used in this study was similar to one used in a published study, neither was validated. In addition, the cross-sectional nature of the study regarding the data collected over a short period may have missed temporal variations that contribute to social insecurity.</p><p>Notwithstanding these limitations, this study could serve as a first step to rekindle the conversation about social insecurity among not only ED patients, but in patients throughout the healthcare system. Furthermore, it could provide the foundational framework for the development, construction, and quantification of a more valid measure of social insecurity in the US for rural, underserved populations that are similar to the current study population.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study highlights the social challenges facing ED patients in a rural North Carolina teaching hospital. Food insecurity, transportation difficulties, and exposure to violence stood as the top three of five factors of social insecurity studied. Historically marginalized and minoritized groups, including Native Americans and Blacks, demonstrated overall higher rates of social insecurity and higher indexes on exposure to violence than their White counterparts. Housing security and communication yielded perverse results that warrant further study.</p><p>Our findings suggest that multifaceted interventions targeted at violence reduction, easing transportation difficulties, and assuring food security are needed to improve the overall social well-being and health outcomes of Robeson County&#8217;s diverse, rural, and medically underserved population. Deliberate and targeted national policies addressing structural racism holistically would be necessary to improve socioeconomic outcomes, overall health, and well-being of individuals and communities, especially the historically marginalized. Finally, a more valid and robust measure of a comprehensively developed construct of social insecurity is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><supplementary-material id="s1-wjem-24-538" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="wjem-24-538-s001.docx" id="d95e468" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine and the UNC-Southeastern Graduate Medical Education Department, for their support and encouragement.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn2-wjem-24-538"><p>Full text available through open access at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://escholarship.org/uc/uciem_westjem" ext-link-type="uri">http://escholarship.org/uc/uciem_westjem</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn3-wjem-24-538" fn-type="COI-statement"><p><italic toggle="yes">Conflicts of Interest</italic>: By the <italic toggle="yes">West</italic>JEM article submission agreement, all authors are required to disclose all affiliations, funding sources and financial or management relationships that could be perceived as potential sources of bias.
