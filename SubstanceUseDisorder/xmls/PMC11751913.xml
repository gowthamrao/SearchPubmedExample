We calculated the annual prevalence of screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, body mass index, alcohol consumption and smoking status using multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with receiving no screening and complete screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 216&#8201;136 patients with SMI, 55% received screening for all six CVD risk factors at least once during follow-up and 35% received all six within a 1-month period. Our findings suggest that patient characteristics and financial incentivisation influence screening prevalence of individual CVD risk factors, the likelihood of receiving screening for all six CVD risk factors annually and risk of receiving no screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The low proportion of people with SMI receiving regular comprehensive CVD risk factor screening is concerning. Screening needs to be embedded as part of broad physical health checks to ensure the health needs of people with SMI are being met. If we are to improve cardiovascular health, interventions are needed where risk of receiving no screening or not receiving regular screening is highest.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Schizophrenia &amp; psychotic disorders</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id

In the analysis of factors associated with CVD risk factor screening, we stratified the analysis into three time periods (April 2004&#8211;March 2011; April 2011&#8211;March 2014; April 2014&#8211;March 2018) based on changes to QOF incentivisation (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>).

Exception reporting is the process by which primary care practices may remove patients from the denominator used to calculate incentivised indicators if they are deemed unsuitable for screening, withdrew consent or did not respond. These patients were retained in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>We investigated screening of six individual CVD risk factors (cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, smoking status and alcohol consumption screening) and a composite outcome of all six. For glucose, we included codes for blood glucose or HbA1c tests or values, but excluded urine testing. For cholesterol, we included any screening code or value. For blood pressure, we included screening codes or values for either diastolic or systolic blood pressure. For BMI, we included BMI values, BMI calculated from height and weight and screening codes. For smoking and alcohol status we included any screening code.

As secondary outcomes we investigated the prevalence of ever-recorded CVD risk factor screening and the proportion of patients who ever had all CVD risk factor screening recorded within a 1-month period. A 1-month period was chosen to assess the likelihood that these were recorded as part of a physical health check, with time allowed for recording of results.</p><p>In the individual-level analysis of factors associated with CVD risk factor screening, our outcomes were &#8216;never receiving screening&#8217; and &#8216;always complete screening&#8217;.

Irregular screening was chosen as the reference category to allow the comparison of characteristics of those who received no screening to those who received complete screening.</p><p>We mutually adjusted for all covariates in the models, with the exception of primary care practice which was used as a clustering term in the calculation of sandwich SEs.

Our findings suggest that patient characteristics and financial incentivisation influence screening prevalence of individual CVD risk factors, the likelihood of receiving screening for all six CVD risk factors annually and risk of receiving no screening. However, as the patient characteristics associated with increased risk of receiving no screening change over the study periods, it is likely that the groups most at risk of missing screening are dynamic and dependent on which measures are incentivised. Between 2014 and 2018, men, younger patients and those without pre-existing conditions, not prescribed antipsychotics or mood stabilisers, of missing or &#8216;other&#8217; ethnicity, or with a diagnosis of &#8216;other psychoses&#8217; had an elevated risk of receiving no screening.</p><p>While for those with missing ethnicity, this is likely driven by lack of healthcare contact underpinning both poor ethnicity recording and low levels of screening, for those of younger age or without other physical health conditions it may be driven by additional factors, such as patient and provider perceptions of need.</p><p>We found a sharp increase in CVD risk factor screening in 2011, particularly for alcohol, BMI, cholesterol and glucose, and coinciding with the introduction of incentivisation of all six CVD risk factors. The subsequent reduction in prevalence of glucose, cholesterol and BMI screening in 2014 coincides with the removal of these from incentivisation in England and Northern Ireland.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> This is in line with previous studies showing a significant reduction in screening for cholesterol and BMI in this period compared with blood pressure in patients with SMI,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and a decrease in target achievement when incentivisation is withdrawn in the general population.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Additionally, we found that incentivisation confers little benefit to those outside of the incentivisation criteria. For example, when cholesterol and glucose screening was incentivised for patients with SMI aged over 40, there was minimal increase in screening in those under 40, so little evidence of halo effects. Likewise, those with &#8216;other psychoses&#8217; had a lower screening prevalence of all CVD risk factors than patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The term &#8216;other psychoses&#8217; covers a range of psychotic diagnoses and symptoms and is broader than the list included under QOF incentivisation. These findings highlight the careful planning needed to ensure those falling outside of incentivisation but still at risk are not marginalised, particularly in those with SMI, who may develop multimorbidity at an early age<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and where formal diagnosis may be delayed. Incentivisation has been shown to increase CVD risk factor screening for those with SMI, bringing it in line with that of the general population, or in the case of alcohol screening surpassing the screening prevalence seen in those without SMI.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14 16 17</sup></xref> While this is encouraging, our results show that screening prevalence differs by patient characteristics and for some patients inequalities still exist. Furthermore, the increased CVD risk profile of those with SMI means that all patients should be receiving CVD risk factor screening, whereas in the general population, those without any risk factors will not be invited to screening. A recent study found that in a population of patients with diabetes, in the 2010&#8211;2011 financial year, 94% had HbA1c recorded, 96% had blood pressure recorded, 91% cholesterol, 89% BMI and 83% smoking, far higher than the screening prevalence of those with SMI.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In 2023, the proportion of patients with SMI receiving screening for all six CVD risk factors was incentivised for the first time.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> While data collected by NHS England for physical health checks performed in primary or secondary care suggest this has increased the prevalence of screening,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>our study highlights the need to also consider regularity of screening and how screening varies by patient characteristics.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The large population size allowed us to stratify results by a range of patient characteristics, while the representative nature of CPRD data makes these results generalisable to the UK for this time period, although with notable differences across the four nations of the UK from 2014. Focusing on longitudinal screening at an individual level, as well as screening prevalence at a population level allowed a better understanding of screening practice over time and the identification of groups of patients who are at risk of receiving no screening. Our results highlight the importance of considering regularity and comprehensiveness of screening at an individual level when evaluating screening interventions, rather than reliance on prevalence of screening at a population level.</p><p>We required that patients had at least 1 year of follow-up during the study period to reliably capture screening activity. This may mean that patients who are transiently registered, who are less likely to be screened, are not included in our results. Our analysis was exploratory in nature and while we investigated a range of factors that we hypothesised were associated with receipt of CVD risk factor screening in primary care, it is likely that many of these factors interact to produce distinct risk profiles. Furthermore, we did not investigate outcomes of screening practices and therefore cannot determine the impact that screening has on, for example, stopping smoking, having controlled blood pressure or starting statins, nor on the longer term health of people with SMI. There is a need for further hypothesis-driven studies to identify groups of patients at risk of missed screening, the impact this has on cardiovascular health and into the effectiveness of physical health checks and CVD risk factor screening in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>People with SMI are at risk of physical health conditions beyond CVD<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and of avoidable physical health hospitalisations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Current NHS guidance describes the incentivised CVD risk factors as core to the physical health check in primary care, but recommends a more comprehensive annual review of physical health.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> However, our findings suggest that CVD risk factors may be captured opportunistically. While opportunistic screening results in higher screening prevalence, screening is only a first step. It is important that patients also receive a comprehensive clinical review of physical health so that coordinated actions can be put in place to manage CVD risk, and diagnose and treat conditions beyond CVD. Clinicians should also be aware that while reported screening prevalence of individual CVD risk factors may be high, few patients have complete screening of all measures, and there are inequalities in who receives these.</p><p>While physical health screening is embedded in primary care, further consideration is warranted as to the provision of physical health checks in mental health services to complement those in primary care and to provide services to those not regularly in contact with their primary care provider. However, this approach is reliant on improved coordination between physical and mental healthcare providers to avoid duplication for both patient and practitioner, and to ensure transfer of important patient information.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The low proportion of people receiving regular CVD risk factor screening suggests that people with SMI are not reliably receiving regular comprehensive physical health checks in primary care. Further consideration is warranted as to how incentivisation and other schemes could improve the regularity and comprehensiveness of screening, rather than just the annual screening prevalence, and whether provision of physical health checks in both physical and mental health services may improve uptake. Hypothesis-driven work is required to identify groups of patients most at risk of not receiving CVD risk factor screening so that targeted interventions can be developed, with consideration of these groups in the planning and implementation of future incentivisation and other improvement schemes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjment-2024-301409</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjment-28-1-s001.pdf" id="d67e1607" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the input from the wider collaborators involved in DATAMIND, and particularly the input from lived experience advisors.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was funded by the UK Research and Innovation grant (MR/W014386/1) as part of the Health Data Research (HDR) UK DATAMIND hub.
