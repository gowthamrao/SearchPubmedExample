Less is known about these changes in different subgroups. It is self-evident that, while most patients may demonstrate trajectories of these changes close to the average one, some groups may follow more or less different trends. Also, it is unclear which preoperative factors may affect the probability of being classified into groups with different development trajectories of surgical outcome. The objective of this study was to identify groups exhibiting distinct trajectories within the broader cohort of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery and to determine whether certain factors may be associated with a probability of being classified into a particular group.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a register-based study of 1,451 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. The group-based trajectory analysis was used separately for leg pain, for back pain, and for functioning.

Despite the substantial body of knowledge concerning the average changes in pain and disability level after surgery, less is known about these changes in different subgroups. It is self-evident that, while most patients may demonstrate trajectories of these changes close to the average one, some groups may follow more or less different trends.</p><p>The group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) is a finite mixture modelling application that has been used to distinguish groups of individuals with similar, by group, trajectories over time [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among other populations, this approach has previously been applied among patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hebert et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have used the GBTA among patients undergoing surgery due to lumbar spinal stenosis. They have observed three trajectories for back and leg pain and disability. For example, three clusters were identified to describe changes in leg pain: groups with excellent (14%), good (50%), and poor outcome (36%). Similarly, three-cluster models have been observed by other previous reports employing the GBTA in similar cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Willems et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have studied the trajectories of leg and back pain and functioning with patients undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy. The results were like the results by Hebert et al.&#8211;up to 80% of the cohort demonstrated great improvement after surgery, but there also were groups with moderate or minimal change or even a relapse after the first three months during a two-year follow-up.</p><p>Some factors have been proposed to explain the differences in the outcome of lumbar surgery. These factors might affect changes in back and leg pain as well as changes in disability severity. Previous studies have linked obesity with worse pain and disability after lumbar decompression surgery [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The results have been inconsistent as other previous reports have suggested that obesity does not necessarily correlate with clinically significant deterioration in functioning and worse pain after surgery, even if obesity might predict elevated rates of complications [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Donnarumma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have reported that women might benefit less from lumbar decompression surgery than men. On the other hand, multiple studies have reported that sex does not affect the magnitude of improvement after lumbar surgery in terms of functioning and quality of life, even though women might experience worse preoperative pain than men do [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Murphy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have reported that elderly patients might increase the risk of complications and longer stay in a hospital after lumbar decompression surgery. Then again, previous studies have reported that lumbar decompression might significantly improve functioning in the long term even among patients over 80 years [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The longer duration of pre-operative pain has been connected to worse post-operative pain and greater disability [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>While the use of GBTA has increased in the past years, the need for large longitudinal analyses has been noticed by previous research [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The evidence regarding risk factors associated with modest or poor results of surgery in terms of pain and disability is limited [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An ability to predict who may benefit from the surgery the most and who does not improve or improve only slightly may be of help when planning surgical procedures. Identifying different postoperative trajectories of disability and pain may provide valuable insights for optimizing pre- and postoperative rehabilitation strategies.</p><p>The objective of this study was to identify groups exhibiting distinct trajectories within the broader cohort of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery and to determine whether certain factors may be associated with the probability of being classified into a particular group. The common goal of lower back surgery is to alleviate radiating lower extremity pain in particular. This study also aimed to find out whether the change in the intensity of low back pain followed the change in lower extremity pain or whether the trajectories of these changes were different postoperatively. The registry data used in this study included both surgeries where fusion techniques were used and surgeries without fusion. It has been assumed here that the indications for surgery in these two groups might differ substantially. Therefore, changes in pain intensity were also analyzed for these two surgical subtypes as a sensitivity test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study cohort consisted of all consecutive patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery of any kind in a university hospital between June 21, 2018, and August 17, 2021.

The total score is calculated as follows: &#8216;Total score = (&#8721;item scores/50) x 100&#8217;. The Finnish version of the ODI was used [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ODI results were interpreted as follows: 0 to 20 points: Minimal disability, 21 to 40 points: Moderate disability, 41 to 60 points: Severe disability, 61 to 80 points: Crippled, 81 to 100 points: Bed-bound [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Back and leg pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) varying from 0 to 100 points, with 0 indicating &#8216;no pain&#8217; and 100 indicating the &#8216;worst possible pain&#8217;. VAS results were interpreted as follows: 0 to 4 points, no pain; 5 to 44 points, mild pain; 45 to 74 points, moderate pain; and 75 to 100 points, severe pain [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Age was defined in full years at the time of surgery. For the main analysis, the sample was divided into four equal age groups: n = 362 (age 50.2 [8.5] years), n = 363 (age 64.6 [2.9] years), n = 363 (age 72.5 [1.8] years) and n = 363 (age 80.2 [3.2] years), respectively. In turn, when calculating relative risk ratios (RRR) by using a logistic regression model, the sample was divided into two equal age groups: n = 725 (age 57.4 [9.6] years) and n = 726 (age 76.4 [4.7] years, respectively. Correspondingly, when calculating RRRs, preoperative leg and back pain duration was dichotomized as &gt; = 3 months vs. &lt;3 months, and BMI was dichotomized as &gt; = 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. &lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The logical chain of GBTA analysis employed here was as follows. The first important question was how many groups (clusters) should be included in the analysis. The number of different trajectories can vary from one (the change in the average of the entire data set) to the n number of the sample (the trajectory is analyzed for each individual person). Another important choice was the shape of the regression curve (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.). Based on these two issues, a model that would meet certain following requirements was preferred. There are no commonly accepted exact recommended selection criteria for the number of trajectories. It greatly depends on a sample size. Here the limit was set that none of the clusters should be smaller than 10% of the sample size. This cut-off was arbitrary and it was based on the sample size and the experience of the authors.</p><p>As additional confirmation, another criterion was set &#8208; in no cluster should the average posterior probability (APP) be lower than 0.7 [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Regarding the degree of the regression curve, a common practice is to try models of different degrees and use in the analysis the highest possible degree, which produces a statistically significant result (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>The goodness of fit of the selected model was assured based on additional statistics: the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were calculated for the different combinations of the numbers of clusters and the regression degrees making sure that their values were closer to zero compared to models based on a smaller number of clusters or other regression degrees [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Trajectory analysis was repeated separately for the ODI and the severity of leg and back pain. The models chosen and their goodness of fit are presented in <xref rid="pone.0313528.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p><p>A two-cluster model demonstrated the best fit for changes in disability severity and leg pain. While a three-cluster model demonstrated an acceptable fit for back pain, the smallest average posterior probability for this model was close to a pre-agreed cut-off of 0.7 and the size of the smallest group was close to a pre-agreed cut-off of 10%. In order to ensure the easiness of interpretation of the results, further analysis was conducted using two-cluster models for all three-factor variables&#8211;disability, back pain, and leg pain.</p><p>The sensitivity test was performed by comparing those who underwent fusion (NAG61, NAG62, NAG63, NAG66, NAG67) vs. no-fusion (ABC36, ABC56, ABC66) surgery.</p><p>After identifying clusters, the probability of group membership was calculated based on sex, age, the leg and back pain duration before surgery, and obesity. These probabilities were expressed as RRR along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

As for the entire sample, overweight was the most common significant predictor of being classified to a group with only short-term improvement (<xref rid="pone.0313528.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>This observational registry-based study of nearly 1,500 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery identified different trajectories of change in pain and disability severity in a two-year follow-up after surgery. These trajectories described either long-term or short-term improvements. Most of the patients (up to four-fifths) could be classified into groups with long-term improvement showing substantial positive trends in both disability and pain during the entire follow-up. The rest of the patients showed only temporary short-term improvement, which diminished after three postoperative months. The probability of being classified into groups with short-term improvement was mostly associated with worse pain and disability before surgery and higher BMI. Sex and age were not significantly associated with the risk of being classified into short-term improvement groups. For back pain, this probability was loosely associated with the longer duration of preoperative pain.</p><p>The present results are in line with some previous research. For example, Li et al. have identified two trajectory groups in a population of patients undergoing spinal surgery: a larger group showing mild post-operative pain and a smaller group showing relapsing pain [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some previous studies have observed three or even four distinguishable trajectory groups among populations that were similar to the cohort studied here [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, Willems et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have observed four different trajectories of change in the severity of leg pain among patients undergoing microdiscectomy: groups with large (79%), moderate (8%), and minimal improvement (5%) and groups with pain relapse (8%). Differences between studies in the number of trajectories might be related to purely medical heterogeneity (diverse indications for surgery or different surgery techniques), as well as to the dissimilar sample sizes, settings, number of repeated measures, the duration of follow-up, distributions of demographic characteristics, etc. Also, some studies have employed outcome measures other than VAS or ODI [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It should also be taken into account that setting cut-offs for the number of trajectories detected through the GBTA is arbitrary and often based on logic and common sense rather than on exact mathematics. Despite these differences, the common trend could be seen in both the present and previous reports&#8211;while most of the patients demonstrate substantial improvements in pain and disability after spine surgery, there is a smaller group, that either improve only for a little while or does not improve at all. The momentary improvement of pain and functioning in the short-term improvement groups could be explained by placebo effect. In 2021, Jamjoom et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported in a systematic review that the placebo effect could last up to six months after spinal surgery and it can be seen in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Other explanations for this momentary improvement and then the return of worse pain or functioning could be increased pain medication post-operatively or the development of a clinical complication such as infection or failure of fixation over time. It is also possible that for some of the patients, functioning may be poor for some reason other than the condition being treated, and the surgery aims for example to reduce radicular pain.</p><p>In agreement with the present findings, obesity has previously been associated with worse surgical outcome [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Park et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have observed the association between BMI&#8805;30 and inferior surgical results in a cohort of 32,000 patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery. The evidence of such a relationship has, however, been controversial. In their systematic review, Ghobrial et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have stated that obesity is not related to higher post-operative VAS-measured back pain, leg pain, or functioning measured with ODI in populations undergoing non-instrumented lumbar spinal surgery according to minimal clinical important difference (MCID) [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in that review by Ghobrial et al, it was found that although overweight subjects had a significant improvement according to the MCID value, they still had greater pain both at baseline and post-operatively in almost all studies. Some other studies have also stated that, even though obesity is associated with more postoperative complications, even overweight people may benefit from surgery [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, Onyekwelu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that although overweight people benefited from surgery, normal weight people benefited more. Additionally, Lingutla et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that problems arose in their study due to the non-standard definition of obesity and the limited availability of data. Also, the study by Divi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] had a small sample size. Even more, Rihn et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that obese patients may benefit more from surgery compared to nonoperative treatment than normal weight patients. On the other hand, this result could be explained by the fact that the response of overweight patients to nonoperative treatment was poor. In 2016, Jackson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] published a systematic review where the effects of obesity on spine surgery were discussed. In that review, it was reported that overweight people have a higher incidence of back pain, radiating pain and a higher rate of disk degeneration. In the review, possible causes of increased disc degeneration were found, for example, to be greater mechanical compression on the spine, chronic inflammation related to obesity and reduced blood flow to the disc. Being overweight has also been linked to a higher risk of complications in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, neither gender nor age increased the probability of being categorized into groups with a worse outcome. Similar results have also been obtained from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Donnarumma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that women may benefit less from lumbar decompression surgery. However, their study was conducted with a small sample size. According to the study by Murphy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] older age increases the risk of complications, longer hospital stay, and discharge to a place other than home. However, their study did not address disability or pain.</p><p>Higher and prolonged pre-operative pain and disability have also previously been found to affect their developmental trajectories after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0313528.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Carrasco et al. [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have reported that worse pre-operative low back pain might be a risk of being categorized into groups with moderate or no improvement after lumbar decompression and microdiscectomy. Also, worse preoperative leg pain was associated with a higher probability of being classified into a group of no-improvement. Prolonged pain maintenance even after the surgery could be explained by central sensitization. Prolonged chronic pain may result in functional, chemical and even structural changes in central nervous system. If so, then nervous system can be persistently in a high activity state and a person can experience pain even in the absence of nociceptive input, which has successfully been treated with surgery [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The generalizability of these findings might be limited due to several issues. The study was set in a highly specified university surgery clinic, and the results might be different in primary care or non-university clinics. Even though most of the patients were undergoing spinal decompression and fusion, the indications for surgery were rather heterogeneous. The data included information from patients who have undergone only one back surgery. However, this restriction only applied to data after the start of registry data collection. It is therefore possible that there were individual patients who underwent more than one operation, if the operations had been performed before the registry data started to be collected. This is a commonly known weakness of register data, a truncation at the beginning of follow-up, which complicates the differentiation between prevalent and incident cases. This weakness could increase the heterogeneity of the sample. As patients with multiple back surgeries have been excluded, the characteristics of the studied sample could deviate from the real-life situation, when patients with degenerative spine diseases often have to undergo several operations. Only a few explanatory variables were available. Thus, it is possible, that some important factors affecting pain and disability after surgery remained unobserved. For example, there was no information on how many patients had diabetes mellitus or how many were smoking. Complications were not taken into account in this material, so based on the results it cannot be stated, for example, that complications caused by obesity would have worsened the treatment outcome. Register-based data commonly suffer from truncation at the start of follow-up making it difficult to differentiate between prevalent and incident cases. Such data may also be affected by unrecognized confounding information and potential data dredging [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The present retrospective study lacked the possibility to deal with missing data as these had not been available for analysis. Many patients did not come to the control visits at the clinic. It is uncertain if the data were missing due to random chance or due to specific reasons, e.g., people with the greatest improvement have not appeared at their post-operative control appointments or the other way round&#8211;people dissatisfied with the results of surgery were not willing participate into follow-up. It has previously been suggested that missing data can substantially affect the precision of estimated change in PROMs scores from clinical registry data [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The study did not explore other potentially relevant PROMs that could provide a more comprehensive assessment of surgical success (e.g., improved quality of life or return to work). This limitation could create uncertainty concerning the overall improvement after surgery. It has been previously reported that back pain and disability may correlate in some situations only loosely [<xref rid="pone.0313528.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, persistent pain does not necessarily mean unchanged quality of life, perceived general health or ability to work. Additionally, the lack of a control group made it impossible to draw any reliable inferences concerning causality. Performing a manual chart review could probably add value to the study by revealing patient characteristics, pathologies, and surgical details, which were not available through the register.</p><p>Further research may replicate these findings in different settings, and populations and using different pre-operative independent risk factors like smoking, educational level, depression severity, etc. Especially important could be confirming the findings in groups, which are more homogenous regarding their indications for surgery and surgery techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study suggest that most of the patients might experience pain relief and improved functioning within three months after lumbar surgery, and this effect may last, at least, two years. However, there is a smaller group who might experience only temporary improvement, which diminishes after three months since surgery. Age, sex, and the duration of preoperative pain did not affect the risk of being classified in a particular group. Instead, higher BMI and worse preoperative pain and disability were associated with the inferior outcome of surgery. When considering surgery, planning pre- and postoperative rehabilitation, or forecasting the use of pain medications, a higher probability of worse outcomes could be expected for overweight and initially more painful patients with higher level of disability.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material

The topic is so interesting for rehabilitation issues, and the study was well done, that their efforts are commendable:</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1- What is your logic for analyzing and categorizing patients according to their leg pain, back pain, etc.? Is it based on the literature or did you select them exploratively?

Please do the same for lines 125 and 126.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>-I would suggest explaining central sensitization as an explanation of pain maintenance even after the surgery (line 263).</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold>&#160;The manuscript presents a well-structured observational study involving nearly 1,500 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery, focusing on long-term outcomes such as pain relief and functional improvement over a two-year period. However, several points warrant attention:</p><p>Abstract: The background section lacks clarity and cohesion, requiring improvement. Additionally, the English writing throughout needs clarity and coherence.</p><p>Introduction: While the study's aim is clear, the background section could benefit from better cohesion leading toward the final conclusions.</p><p>Methodology: Clarification is needed regarding the administration of questionnaires to patients. The rationale behind the wide timeframe (2-4, 11-13, and 23-25 months post-surgery) for data collection should be elaborated upon. Although previous data were utilized, the specific rationale for this timeframe should be explicitly stated. Furthermore, details on how missing data were handled are crucial for assessing the study's robustness.</p><p>The study did not explore other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that could provide a more comprehensive assessment of surgical success (e.g., quality of life measures, return to work). This omission and its implications should be discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>Discussion: While the manuscript briefly compares findings with previous studies, a more comprehensive discussion integrating conflicting results and methodological differences across studies would enhance the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>The manuscript lacks exploration into potential mechanisms underlying observed associations (e.g., why higher BMI correlates with poorer outcomes). This mechanistic insight should be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
