Consequent impacts on morbidity, mortality, healthcare expenditure, and health-related quality of life, make this a problem of the utmost importance to address. One way to improve T2DM outcomes is to address lifestyle behaviours that may affect prognosis and complications, such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, smoking status, and alcohol intake. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to describe the prevalence of being physically active, having a healthy diet, currently smoking, and currently drinking alcohol among people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China. Regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with these lifestyle behaviours. We found a high prevalence of a healthy diet (97.8%, 95% CI 96.5&#8211;98.7%). Prevalence of being physically active (83.4%, 95% CI 80.6&#8211;85.9%), smoking (21.6%, 95% CI 18.8&#8211;24.6%), and alcohol drinking (32.9%. 95% CI 29.6&#8211;36.2%) appeared in keeping with those of the general population. Marked associations were demonstrated between male sex and smoking (OR 41.1, 95% CI 16.2&#8211;139.0), and male sex and alcohol drinking (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.62&#8211;6.20). Correlation between lifestyle factors was demonstrated including between alcohol drinking and smoking, and between physical activity and reduced smoking. General diabetes self-management education programmes that address multiple lifestyle risk factors simultaneously may be beneficial in this population. Specific interventions targeting smoking cessation and reduction in alcohol drinking may be of benefit to men living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Nottingham China Health Institute, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>WKJ-ZJ-2216</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Department of Health and Social Care and the National Institute for Health Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>NIHR301000</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by the Nottingham China Health Institute, China, and the Major Science and Technology Projects for Health of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. WKJ-ZJ-2216).

In 2021, the age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes in people aged 20&#8211;79 in China reached 10.6%, and an estimated 51.7% of those with diabetes were thought to be undiagnosed [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Diabetes is thought to be directly responsible for 3.9% of deaths in those under 60 [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Expenditure on diabetes-related health costs was estimated at 165,304 million US dollars in 2021, and this is projected to continue growing [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Ningbo is an economically developed city in the eastern, coastal province of Zhejiang. The prevalence of T2DM in Ningbo exceeds national averages, with over 20% of the over-40s affected [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequences include high rates of micro- and macro-vascular complications amongst those living with T2DM, as well as negative health-related quality-of-life impacts; particularly in the domains of depression, anxiety, and pain [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Lifestyle behaviours are also heavily contextual, intertwined with how people live their lives, and thus warrant contextual assessment. Through a better understanding of the distribution of various lifestyle behaviours and the factors associated with them, it may be possible to efficiently target lifestyle interventions towards key areas of need. Therefore, we aimed to describe the prevalence of being physically active, having a healthy diet, currently smoking, and currently drinking alcohol among people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China; and to determine the factors associated with these lifestyle behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This cross-sectional study was carried out at the diabetes outpatient clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.

Data on the following variables were collected: age (18&#8211;39&#8201;years, 40&#8211;59&#8201;years, or&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;60&#8201;years), sex (female or male), education level (no qualification, class 1&#8211;6, class 7&#8211;12, or college/university), occupation (manual worker, non-manual worker, or never worked/retired), residence (urban or rural as defined based on the &#8216;hukou&#8217; registration system), marital status (married or single/widowed/divorced), health insurance (yes or no), duration of T2DM (&#8804;1 year, &gt;1&#8211;5&#8201;years, &gt;5&#8211;10&#8201;years, or &gt;10&#8201;years), and family history of T2DM (no or yes; T2DM in any parent or sibling).</p><p>Data were also collected on biochemical, anthropometric, and physiological parameters. The anthropometric and physiological parameters were measured twice per participant, and the average of these two readings was used in the analysis. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured using venous blood sampling and the high&#8208;performance liquid chromatographic method (D&#8208;10 Hemoglobin Analyzer, Bio&#8208;Rad). Controlled T2DM was defined as HbA1c&#8201;&lt;&#8201;7% in accordance with the Chinese T2DM guideline [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Body weight (kilograms [kg] to one decimal place), height (metres [m] to two decimal places), and waist circumference (centimetres [cm] to the nearest half cm) were measured. Body weight and height were measured with light clothes and without shoes in the standing position using a calibrated automatic digital weight and height scale (HNH&#8208;318, Omron, Japan). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Participants were categorised as &#8216;not overweight&#8217; (BMI&#8201;&lt;&#8201;23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), &#8216;overweight&#8217; (BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;23.0&#8201;&lt;&#8201;27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), or &#8216;obese&#8217; (BMI&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) based on reference ranges specific to the Chinese population [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Waist circumference was measured using a 150 cm medical tape at the midpoint between the lower rib and iliac crest. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of &gt;90&#8201;cm in males or&#8201;&gt;80&#8201;cm in females based on reference ranges specific to the Chinese population [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Blood pressure was measured on the day of the visit in a seated position using a calibrated, automated sphygmomanometer (HBP-1100U, Omron, Japan), and hypertension was defined as &#8805;140/90&#8201;mmHg in keeping with Chinese guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The outcomes in the present study were the prevalence of four lifestyle behaviours including two positive behaviours (being physically active and having a healthy diet) and two negative behaviours (being a current smoker and being a current alcohol drinker). This paper focused on current rather than retrospective healthy and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours based on the rationale that these are potentially modifiable, whereas past lifestyle behaviours are not. Data on physical activity were obtained using the validated IPAQ questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#8212;short form), available in Mandarin [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Being physically active was defined as currently meeting the criteria for the moderate or high physical activity IPAQ categories [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Data on diet were obtained using a modified version of the UK Diabetes and Diet Questionnaire (UKDDQ) [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The questions were adapted to be relevant to dietary norms in China, and the questionnaire was translated into Mandarin and pre-tested (see above). A healthy diet was defined as currently having more than 50% A&#8201;+&#8201;B answers on the UKDDQ which correspond to &#8216;healthy&#8217; dietary choices [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Data on current smoking and alcohol drinking status were obtained through self-reporting via the aforementioned quantitative questionnaire.</p><p>Participants were assigned a participant identification number which the authors had access to during and after data collection.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Ethics approval was received from the Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China (ref. 2019-R057). The participant information sheet and consent form were available in Mandarin.

During data cleaning, data were screened for implausible values (data cleaning completed by NC), and these were deleted where found and treated as missing. If the implausible value was one of a pair of repeated measures, both measures were deleted and treated as missing. Descriptive statistics were calculated including median and interquartile range (IQR) for the non-normally distributed continuous variable of age, and numbers and percentages for categorical variables (all other variables). Prevalence was calculated as the number of participants with the lifestyle behaviour as a proportion of all participants, with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the PropCIs package in R. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were undertaken to measure the unadjusted and adjusted associations respectively between the independent variables and the four outcomes (being physically active, having a healthy diet, current smoking, and current alcohol drinking), using the glm() function in R. This produced odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Independent variables were selected for inclusion in the multivariable model using a significance cut-off of p&#8804;0.2 in the univariate analysis. The overall significance cut-off was set at p&#8804;0.05. Missing data were excluded listwise.</p><p>A sensitivity analysis was conducted using waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) &#8805; 0.5 to define abdominal obesity rather than the previously specified waist circumference thresholds [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 806 patients with T2DM participated in the study.

Being single/widowed/divorced (versus married) was associated with reduced odds of having a healthy diet (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07&#8211;0.96). Male sex (versus female) was associated with a marked increase in the odds of being a current smoker (OR 41.1, 95% CI 16.2&#8211;139.0). Being an alcohol drinker was also associated with increased odds of being a smoker (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.22&#8211;2.82). Factors which were associated with reduced odds of smoking included college/university education (versus no qualification) [OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06&#8211;0.65], being single/widowed/divorced (versus married) [OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.09&#8211;0.80], and being physically active (versus not physically active) [OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33&#8211;0.96]. Several factors were associated with increased odds of being an alcohol drinker including male sex (versus female) [OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.62&#8211;6.20], being a non-manual worker (versus manual) [OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01&#8211;2.83], being a smoker (versus not a smoker) [OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.27&#8211;2.94], having a family history of T2DM (versus not) [OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.30&#8211;2.59], and being overweight (versus not overweight) [OR 1.48, 95% 1.01&#8211;2.18]. Several of these analyses are of borderline significance given the 95% CIs approach one (the threshold of no association). This includes the effect estimate for the association between being single/widowed/divorced and a healthy diet, between physical activity and smoking, between being a non-manual worker and alcohol drinking, and between being overweight and alcohol drinking.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0294245.t002" orientation="portrait"><object-id

This could be considered unexpected as both physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet are known risk factors for T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this cohort of people living with T2DM had received established diabetes clinic care including lifestyle advice. It is possible that some participants enacted lifestyle changes by increasing physical activity and healthy diet following diagnosis. Social desirability bias in the answering of the questionnaires on physical activity and diet is also possible. Alternatively, high levels of physical activity and a healthy diet may have preceded diagnosis despite the known risk factors for T2DM. A cross-sectional analysis amongst a national sample of Chinese people aged &#8805;45 years found the prevalence of physical inactivity was 19.3% (95% CI 18.3&#8211;20.4%), giving a converse physically active prevalence of approximately 80.7%; comparable to our estimate [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Comparable data on diet is difficult to find, however, our estimates of healthy diet prevalence appear to generally exceed those previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of current smoking in this study was 21.6% (95% CI 18.8&#8211;24.6%), in keeping with the known high smoking prevalence in China [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The prevalence of alcohol drinking was 32.9% (95% CI 29.6&#8211;36.2%). Alcohol drinking is known to vary significantly across different geographical areas in China [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous Ningbo-specific estimates (based on the prevalence of being a monthly frequent alcohol drinker) were 52.5% for men, 12.3% for women, and 29.9% across both sexes [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our estimate of alcohol drinking prevalence amongst this cohort of people living with T2DM is therefore likely comparable to the general population of Ningbo.</p><p>The results were suggestive of an association between rural residence (versus urban) and reduced odds of being physically active (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39&#8211;0.88). A previous study amongst middle-aged and older Chinese people has found a similar association between urban residence and reduced odds of incident physical inactivity, though not prevalent physical inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This seems initially counter-intuitive, given the known association between urbanisation and reduced physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further, older cross-sectional survey data from China found a larger proportion of rural residents reported being physically active compared to urban residents (78.1% and 21.8%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Differences in measurement tools used to capture physical activity may account for some of the variations, however, these contradictions may be driven by wider complexities including an ageing population and health disparities with greater health disadvantages in rural areas that could predispose to physical inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Historically, most physical activity in China was undertaken in the work environment, with higher rates of manual labour in rural areas [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Rapid urbanisation may have resulted in a declining proportion of the rural population that is physically active, through impact on work patterns. Parallel rises in leisure-related physical activity in more economically developed areas may accentuate this pattern [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An alternative explanation may be the differential validity of the IPAQ questionnaire between the urban and rural participants of the study. For example, 25.3% of participants from urban areas had a college or university education, versus 6.2% in rural areas. Participants with fewer educational opportunities could have a reduced understanding of the required questionnaire responses. Research assessing physical activity patterns in urban and rural settings longitudinally may provide further clarity on the changes occurring in these settings.</p><p>Being single/widowed/divorced (versus married) was associated with reduced odds of having a healthy diet in the present study (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07&#8211;0.96). The effect estimate was suggestive of a 77% reduction though with wide 95% CIs consistent with a 93% reduction through to a 4% reduction. Given the CI approaching one, we would advise caution in the over-interpretation of this result. It is possible that dietary habits could be influenced by marital status, though this is likely to be a complex relationship with the potential for gender-based differences amongst other factors [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Qualitative research exploring the interplay between social relationships and diet in this setting may be of benefit.</p><p>Prominent associations found in this study were between male sex (versus female) and smoking (an estimated 41-fold increased odds), and male sex (versus female) and alcohol drinking (an estimated 4-fold increased odds). Caution is required in interpreting the association between sex and smoking status given there were very few women who were current smokers in the study, and thus the magnitude of the effect estimate may not be reliable. However, these findings are in keeping with the existing literature which demonstrates a higher prevalence of these harmful lifestyle behaviours among men versus women in China [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Smoking is known to increase the risk of diabetic complications [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Evidence for whether alcohol is an independent risk factor for T2DM is mixed and may interact with other factors such as gender and ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, alcohol consumption can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and can negatively impact self-care behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The findings thus highlight the importance of addressing smoking and alcohol intake amongst men living with T2DM in Ningbo, given the high prevalence and interaction with T2DM.</p><p>The findings of our study are broadly supportive of the concept of lifestyle interventions that target multiple lifestyle behaviours simultaneously, given there is a correlation between several of the lifestyle behaviours. Being an alcohol drinker was associated with increased odds of being a smoker (and vice versa), whilst being physically active was associated with reduced odds of smoking, albeit with a 95% CI approaching one (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.22&#8211;2.82; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.27&#8211;2.94; and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33&#8211;0.96, respectively). Broad diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) programmes that address a wide variety of self-care behaviours simultaneously may be more efficient than trying to address each risk factor through separate efforts [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Other factors associated with reduced odds of smoking in the current study were having a college/university education (versus no qualification) and being single/widowed/divorced (versus married) [OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06&#8211;0.65; and OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.09&#8211;0.80, respectively]. For the former, this may reflect broader links between lower socio-economic status and higher smoking prevalence in China [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For the latter, data from a nationally representative survey in China was suggestive of an association between being single and lower smoking prevalence in men, which may account for our findings [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Other factors associated with increased odds of alcohol drinking were a family history of T2DM, being a non-manual worker (versus manual), and being overweight (versus not overweight) [OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.30&#8211;2.59; OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01&#8211;2.83; and OR 1.48, 95% 1.01&#8211;2.18, respectively]. The latter two associations are of borderline significance. For the former (alcohol drinking and family history of T2DM), it is possible that less healthy behaviours could be more commonplace amongst families with higher rates of T2DM. In sensitivity analysis, using WHtR &#8805; 0.5 to define abdominal obesity (rather than the previously specified waist circumference thresholds), being an alcohol drinker was significantly associated with abdominal obesity (adjusted OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.24&#8211;3.57). This may be a more sensitive measure of abdominal obesity compared to waist circumference thresholds which do not take height into account, and is an intuitive finding given the calorific content of alcohol [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first study addressing the prevalence of lifestyle behaviours in a cohort of patients living with T2DM at a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China; and may help to inform the development of future lifestyle behaviour support interventions at the clinic. Additional strengths of the study include generally low rates of missing data (<xref rid="pone.0294245.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and an emphasis on the reliability of measurements through standardised processes, use of validated questionnaires, and duplicate anthropometric measurements.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the aforementioned risk of social desirability bias when participants answer questions about behaviours they perceive to have a value judgment. This may have restricted our ability to detect the true prevalence of &#8216;negative&#8217; lifestyle behaviours. Measurement of lifestyle behaviours generally presents a challenge however future research in this area could make use of more objective methods [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The binary categorisation of the four lifestyle behaviours in the present study comes with some loss of information on the extent of lifestyle behaviours, however was necessary for the chosen analytical strategy. Data were not collected on comorbidities and complications which may also be associated with lifestyle behaviours. The cross-sectional nature of the study also prevented the establishment of cause and effect between the associated factors and the lifestyle behaviours. In addition, there were a high number of analyses in the present study which may increase the risk of false-positive associations. Those associations of borderline statistical significance should be interpreted with caution. Given the highly contextual nature of lifestyle behaviours, the generalisability of the findings outside of the Ningbo context or to those without T2DM is limited. Further, the clinic-based sampling strategy created potential selection bias, as the characteristics of participants attending the diabetes clinic may differ systematically from people living with T2DM more generally across Ningbo. Additionally, those from the clinic who opted to participate may differ from those who did not, and data on non-responders were not collected due to the large workload in the busy clinic setting of the study. It could be anticipated that people living with T2DM who were engaged and satisfied with clinic care and willing to take part in a study [<xref rid="pone.0294245.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] may be more likely to also engage with healthy lifestyle advice, which could have resulted in an overestimate of healthy lifestyle behaviours in our sample. However, the study provides useful information on a specified population, helping to identify potential areas for targeted lifestyle interventions. Complementary qualitative research which explores the lived experiences of those with T2DM regarding their lifestyle behaviours would help elucidate barriers and facilitators of lifestyle change in this context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated the prevalence of four key lifestyle behaviours amongst people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China. We found high levels of a healthy diet. Levels of physical activity, smoking, and alcohol drinking appeared in keeping with those of the general population. Marked associations were demonstrated between male sex and smoking (41-fold increased odds) and male sex and alcohol drinking (4-fold increased odds). Correlation between lifestyle factors was demonstrated including between alcohol drinking and smoking and between physical activity and reduced smoking. General DSME/S programmes that address multiple lifestyle-related risk factors simultaneously may be beneficial in this population.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;The results of the present study may be meaningful for the study participants. However, I have some comments on the study.</p><p>Line 66-68: The study participants were selected from single hospital, which indicated that the study participants can not represent the status of the total T2DM patients living in Ningbo. In other words, I considered that there may be serious and uncontrolled representativeness bias in the present study.</p><p>Line 74: The diagnostic criteria of T2DM should be described in the text. Is there difference between diagnostic criteria of T2DM of China and of IDF / ADA? If there is, then why?</p><p>Line 88-89: The authors should clearly describe if there were study participants whose two readings were significantly different, and the significant difference should also be defined. If there were, then the measurement may be untrusted and that patient should be excluded.</p><p>Line 101-103, table 1 and 2: I suggest that waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) should be used to define abdominal obesity because waist circumference alone did not take differences in height into account. At least, the associations of WHtR with lifestyle behaviours and associated factors should be researched in the present manuscript.</p><p>Line 136: The study should include information on duration of smoking cessation in those ex-smokers. Actually, the years immediately following smoking cessation may represent a time of increased risk for DM (PMID: 34964876).</p><p>Line 207-208: It is difficult to exactly assess the intensity of physical activity (PA). The present study obtained PA data using IPAQ questionnaire (Line 109). I guess there may be another reasons: for example, the authors should describe if there was difference in education level between rural and urban participants in the results section. If education level of rural participants was lower than their urban counterparts, than the reliability of their IPAQ questionnaire results may be lower because of lower ability to understand and/or patience.</p><p>Line 233-241: The association between alcohol drinking and DM should be discussed in more detail. Moderate alcohol intake had minimal detrimental effects on long-term blood glucose management (PMID: 26294775). Furthermore, though the authors of a recent published study (PMID: 37414658) speculated that the emerged discomfort reduced alcohol consumption frequency in DM population of China, that frequency was not significantly associated with DM risk.</p><p>Line 264-265: Though that may be the first study &#8220;in a cohort of patients living with T2DM in Ningbo&#8221;, I still considered that the innovativeness of the present study is quite limited. As the authors mentioned, Ningbo ist an economically developed city in the eastern, coastal province of Chekiang (Line 47), however, I don't understand why the authors selected Ningbo as the studied city. The status of the city can not represent the most developed regions of China, and that city may not even represent the province of Chekiang. Furthermore, as above-mentioned, the study participants of the present study can not represent the status of the total T2DM patients living in Ningbo. Therefore, I considered that the present study may be only beneficial to those 806 study participants, and other T2DM patients may not benefit from the present study. The authors should clearly explain the innovativeness of the present study and the representativeness of the sample.</p><p>Line 269-281: There were some other limitations that the authors should mention in the text. For example, the cause and effect relationship can not be examined in the present cross-sectional study.</p><p>Line 276-278: I still considered that the present study only provides information in those 806 study participants because they can not represent the status of the total T2DM patients living in Ningbo.</p><p>Line 284-285: Again, the prevalence found in the present study was not the prevalence amongst T2DM patients in Ningbo, but just the prevalence amongst those 806 study participants.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This paper presents a cross sectional study on a descriptive analyses of life style risk factors and their associated factors in Ningbo, China. I have some concerns regarding selection bias due to the unexpectedly high prevalence of healthy diet and physical activity among the sample of individuals with type 2 diabetes, as this disease is strongly a lifestyle dependent disease. The authors attempted to discuss the unexpected result, but the aspect of selection bias was missing in the discussion and the limitations.</p><p>- How did you address selection bias?</p><p>- How were the participants asked to join the study? Were there any incentives?</p><p>- How was the response rate? It could very well be that those who accepted to participate are the ones who are more aware of their health. This is especially relevant because anthropometric measurements were taken, which would be uncomfortable for overweight or obese individuals.</p><p>- Is it possible to perform a non-responder analysis? This might also help understand the results of the study</p><p>- Did the questionnaire also include question on complications and comorbidities? If no, why, and if yes, why were they not considered in the analysis as they are highly relevant (for example by stratifying the sample by morbidity level)?</p><p>- Why were the extent of smoking and alcohol (for example number of cigarettes per day or frequency of alcohol intake) not considered?</p><p>The study would have a potential for being worth publishing, but only after addressing the issue of selection bias by adding justifications for example, and by including the response rate and reflecting on it.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

However, I considered that there are still some comments which the authors should response.</p><p>Comment #3: Lines 140-142: The authors should clearly define the implausible value in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Comment #7: The pages of reference #38 were volume 33 issue 9 1693-1701, but not S0939-4753(23)00091-1.</p><p>Comment #8: I agree that the present findings worth reporting and sharing after the phrase changed to &#8220;people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic&#8230;&#8221;. I suggest the authors provide more information on that diabetes clinic (i.e. the first affiliated hospital of Ningpo University), to explain why that clinic, but not other clinic, was chosen as the studied clinic. For example, if the first affiliated hospital had the best medical and diagnostic facilities for T2DM in Ningpo, or not?</p><p>Moreover, there were some other suggestions. First, the authors should carefully check the content of manuscript to avoid minor errors, for example, the above-mentioned reference #38 and the reference order. Second, it would be better if the DOI of all references were listed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Even though the authors did a good job in the analyses and writing the manuscript, the study appears to have serious potential selection bias that was not addressed properly during the sampling phase. Data essential for calculating response rate and performing a basic non-responder analysis is not available, and this cannot be neglected especially that as the authors also explain, the sample is not representative and the generalisability of the data is very limited. In fact, I also doubt the generalisability of the data to the specific diabetes centre in Ningbo where the sample was recruited, since no information what so ever exists on non-responders. Therefore, I have problems in trusting the results of the study. In addition, no convincing justification is provided as to why the study was done using this specific diabetes centre (a collaborative partnership with the hospital is not a sufficient justification), so that I am not pretty sure what the results of this study would add to the literature, or whether the results are worth publishing.

</p><p>Monday, 4th September 2023</p><p>Dear Hidetaka Hamasaki,</p><p>Re: PONE-D-23-19169R1</p><p>Lifestyle behaviours and associated factors among people with type 2 diabetes in Ningbo, China: A cross-sectional study</p><p>Many thanks for your further correspondence regarding the above manuscript following the second round of peer review, and requesting minor revisions based on reviewer #1&#8217;s comments. Please see point-by-point responses below. </p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p><p>Dr Kaushik Chattopadhyay, on behalf of the authors</p><p>&#8195;</p><p>Minor revisions following second round of peer review &#8211; point-by-point response.</p><p>Editor:</p><p>1) Journal Requirements:</p><p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article's retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>The in-text citations and reference list have been reviewed, with the following corrections. In text citations were in curved brackets e.g. (1) which have now been changed to square brackets e.g. [1] as per PLOS One submission guidelines. The reference in line 100 has been corrected from (17) to [18]. The reference in line 123 has been corrected from (20) to [21]. DOIs have been added to the reference list where available. Publication months have been added to the reference list where available. Page numbers for reference 38 were corrected. The full updated reference list with tracked-changes is available from lines 356 to 512. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, no retracted articles have been cited.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) Comment #3: Lines 140-142: The authors should clearly define the implausible value in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The decision as to whether a value was implausible was at the discretion of the researchers during the data cleaning process. A record was kept of these decisions. The manuscript text has been changed to reflect this as below (lines 139-140):</p><p>&#8216;During data cleaning, data were screened for implausible values (as judged by the researchers), and these were deleted where found and treated as missing.&#8217;</p><p>2) Comment #7: The pages of reference #38 were volume 33 issue 9 1693-1701, but not S0939-4753(23)00091-1.</p><p>Thank you, this has been corrected (please see reference 38).</p><p>3) Comment #8: I agree that the present findings worth reporting and sharing after the phrase changed to "people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic...". I suggest the authors provide more information on that diabetes clinic (i.e. the first affiliated hospital of Ningpo University), to explain why that clinic, but not other clinic, was chosen as the studied clinic. For example, if the first affiliated hospital had the best medical and diagnostic facilities for T2DM in Ningpo, or not?</p><p>An additional line has been added with further information about the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, as below (lines 72-73). We are not able to draw comparisons regarding quality of care across T2DM care providers in Ningbo in the context of this research paper. </p><p>As well as providing specialist health and medical services, the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University is involved in medical research and education (6).</p><p>4) Moreover, there were some other suggestions. First, the authors should carefully check the content of manuscript to avoid minor errors, for example, the above-mentioned reference #38 and the reference order.</p><p>The manuscript has been further proof-read for correction of minor errors. The sentence in line 21-23 was reordered to improve readability. Line 50: the word &#8216;being&#8217; was removed as it was unnecessary. </p><p>As above, the in-text citations and reference list have been reviewed, with the following corrections. In text citations were in curved brackets e.g. (1) which have now been changed to square brackets e.g. [1] as per PLOS One submission guidelines. The reference in line 100 has been corrected from (17) to [18]. The reference in line 123 has been corrected from (20) to [21]. DOIs have been added to the reference list where available. Publication months as well as the year have been added where available. Page numbers for reference 38 were corrected. The full updated reference list with tracked-changes is available from lines 356 to 512. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, no retracted articles have been cited.</p><p>5) Second, it would be better if the DOI of all references were listed.</p><p>Many thanks, DOIs have been added where available (please see reference list).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0294245.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0294245.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Hamasaki</surname><given-names initials="H">Hidetaka</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Hidetaka Hamasaki</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Hidetaka Hamasaki</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0294245" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
