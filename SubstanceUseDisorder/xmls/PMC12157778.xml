Alcohol and opioid use present significant public health challenges worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These substances contribute to morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare utilization across diverse populations [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The consequences of alcohol and opioid misuse extend beyond individual health, impacting families, communities, and healthcare systems [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Emergency departments (EDs) play a pivotal role in addressing the acute consequences of substance use disorders, serving as primary points of entry into the healthcare system for individuals in crisis [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>While much of the recent focus has been on opioids due to the unprecedented rise in opioid-related poisonings and deaths [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], longitudinal studies of individuals with substance use disorders have largely neglected the distinct harms associated with alcohol use. Despite its well-documented burden on public health, alcohol use has received comparatively less attention in the context of healthcare utilization and acute care studies. This oversight is significant given that in 2016, more than 4% of all deaths in Canada were attributed to alcohol use, which also contributed to over 6% of all potential years of life lost among individuals aged 15 years and older [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While research on opioid-related health service utilization has expanded in recent years, studies examining patterns of healthcare use for alcohol-related presentations, particularly in comparison to opioid-related presentations remain scarce. Addressing this gap is crucial for understanding the unique healthcare trajectories and needs of individuals with alcohol-related disorders, thereby enabling the development of more comprehensive and effective substance use care strategies.</p><p>Several reports have focused on identifying the burden of substance use presentations in hospitals, which is used as a key performance indicator (KPI) in Ontario [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, none have modeled the association between types of substance use presentations in the ED (opioid and alcohol) and the subsequent risk of hospital admission. Examining the time and number of ED episodes leading up to a hospital admission can indicate the clinical severity of conditions within a population [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Examining clinical severity by way of acute care use patterns can demonstrate the differential impacts of alcohol and opioid use on healthcare systems and shed light on whether the timing of interventions can improve outcomes. This may provide evidence for healthcare providers to tailor resources and interventions accordingly.</p><p>Therefore, our objective is to evaluate the association between opioid and alcohol presentations in the ED and the subsequent risk of hospital admission. Previous studies have independently explored hospital admissions associated with alcohol-related presentations [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and opioid-related presentations [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], yet few have directly compared these two groups within the same analytical framework. Comparative investigations examining hospital utilization for these two common SUD presentations remain limited. Incorporating both conditions into a unified analysis can provide critical insights into differential healthcare trajectories and inform targeted resource allocation. This analysis evaluates whether opioid- versus alcohol-related ED presentations are associated with differences in hospitalization risk, including both the time to admission and the number of ED visits preceding admission. It is hypothesized that individuals presenting with opioid-related concerns will exhibit a higher risk of inpatient admission and require more ED visits prior to hospitalization than those presenting with alcohol-related concerns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This study is a retrospective cohort analysis using administrative data. The study focused on patients who had an index visit to either the ED or hospital facility at Health Sciences North (HSN) in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The retrospective data were obtained on March 21, 20223. For the purpose of this study, all identifying information was removed for the analysis. Hospital visits were specifically identified based on substance use being listed as either the primary or secondary reason for their visit, as classified within Chapter 5 of the Canadian version of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CA) [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], under codes F10-19. All data underwent de-identification procedures, and ethical approval was obtained in accordance with local regulations, as reviewed by HSN&#8217;s Research Ethics Board #23&#8211;039. Health Sciences North HSN is an acute care hospital situated in a small urban setting in Northern Ontario, serving approximately 570,000 individuals across Northeastern Ontario.

Two criteria were used to identify homelessness for this study: 1) patients were flagged by identifying an ICD-10 code Z59; 2) trained abstractors examine the EMR for physician notes of homelessness, and descriptors of homelessness (no fixed address). Mental health diagnoses were determined using all ICD-10 F codes, excluding F1, which indicates substance use. Two in-hospital intervention groups were adjusted for as well: [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Addiction Medicine Consult Service (AMCS) which provides substance use support to all patients both hospitalized and in ED; [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the Addiction Medicine Unit (AMU), an inpatient medical unit offering stabilization support.</p><p>Triage level at the time of ED presentation was also included as a covariate to assess initial acuity and clinical urgency, using the standardized five-level Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), where level 1 represents the most urgent and level 5 the least.</p><p>The selected covariates are relevant as they capture baseline patient characteristics and clinical factors that may influence health outcomes, including age, sex, homelessness, mental health status, and substance use history [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

All statistical tests were at the p&#8201;=&#8201;0.05 and 95% confidence threshold for statistical significance. Kaplan-Meier curves were fit to measure the raw admission probabilities within 100 days of the initial ED visit, and the number of ED visits leading up to the first admission. Both Kaplan-Meier curves were tested for differences with the Mantel-Haenszel test. All statistical analyses were computed using SAS for academics 3.1.0.

We examined differences between these groups in terms of time to hospitalization and number of ED visits prior to admission, to assess our hypothesis that individuals with opioid-related presentations would experience higher hospitalization risk and require more ED visits before admission. There was a statistically significant higher proportion of females in the opioid group (37.93%) compared to the alcohol group (30.18%). The opioid group was significantly younger than the alcohol group, with a mean age of 36.86 years (SD&#8201;=&#8201;11.76) versus 44.58 years (SD&#8201;=&#8201;17.71), respectively. Regarding homelessness, 9.63% of individuals in the alcohol group were homeless compared to 37.47% of those in the opioid group, a significant difference (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001). A higher proportion of individuals in the alcohol group resided in Northern Ontario (91.99%) compared to the opioid group (71.81%). Mental health disorders were identified in 10.68% of individuals in the alcohol group and 15.71% of those in the opioid group (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001).

Our research yielded several key findings. We found high rates of next-day (14%) and 3-day (10%) hospital admissions after discharge from the ED among individuals presenting with opioid use. We observed lower rates of next-day (3%) and 3-day (8%) hospital admissions among those presenting with alcohol use. We also observed that 30% of individuals presenting with opioid use were admitted to the hospital upon their next ED visit, compared to 50% of individuals presenting with alcohol use. Additionally, each additional ED visit increases the risk of inpatient admission by 28% more for individuals with opioid-related issues compared to those with alcohol-related issues. Furthermore, 40.88% of individuals presenting with opioid use and 41.53% of those presenting with alcohol use revisit the ED within 30 days. We identified that experiencing homelessness is associated with a 40% increased likelihood of a 30-day revisit, and notably, a higher proportion of individuals presenting with opioids experience homelessness compared to those presenting with alcohol (37.47% versus 9.63%).</p><p>Our findings show heterogeneity among patients in the opioid and alcohol group presenting to HSN ED with regards to age, experience of homelessness, and infections. However, triage levels and healthcare utilization metrics such as length of stay and 30-day ED revisits were not significantly different. Our findings align with previous research indicating that patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are typically aged 35&#8211;45 years, with older patients seen in the ED visits group [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The higher rates of infection and homelessness are also supported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The high rates of next-day and subsequent ED visit admissions for people presenting with opioid use and alcohol use indicate significant healthcare needs among these populations and possibly unmet needs based on lack of provider training comfort with substance use disorders, and stigma. It has been shown that people who use substances are more likely to leave the ED without being seen, leave against medical advice (AMA), or be discharged prematurely, leading to acute subsequent healthcare events severe enough to necessitate hospitalization shortly after their ED discharge [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Premature discharges and leaving AMA have been associated with poor healthcare experiences, stigma, discrimination, and the underestimation of severe health events among people who use substances [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The findings that each additional ED visit increases the risk of inpatient admission by 28%for individuals with opioid-related issues compared to alcohol-related issues highlight the distinct healthcare challenges posed by these substances. Individuals in the opioid group required more ED visits before admission, suggesting more complex or severe health needs. While opioid use is often associated with acute crises necessitating immediate hospitalization, alcohol-related admissions may reflect chronic conditions with differing trajectories of care. This distinction is an opportunity to improve healthcare interactions for people who use substances and better intervene at the point of contact to prevent suffering and reduce healthcare costs. Hospital admissions are often driven by withdrawal symptoms from alcohol and opioids, exacerbation of chronic conditions such as liver disease, or injuries and infections related to drug use [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Prompt initiation of evidence-based treatments, such as medication-assisted therapy can mitigate acute complications and reduce the need for repeat ED visits and costly hospital admission [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, implementing integrated care models that combine addiction treatment with emergency care such as addiction consult services can improve continuity of care, reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, increase connections with outpatient addiction supports, and address both acute and chronic health needs of individuals with substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0325083.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>To further support long-term recovery and reduce hospital utilization, initiating opioid management during hospitalization and ensuring coordinated transitions to outpatient care is essential. Structured discharge planning that includes OAT and follow-up care has been shown to be effective [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, the NavSTAR trial demonstrated that patient navigation, a model offering care coordination, motivational support, and linkage to community services which significantly reduced readmissions among individuals with comorbid substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0325083.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Embedding such strategies into standard practice can improve treatment engagement and foster sustained recovery.</p><p>The study has noteworthy limitations. First, it relied on retrospective administrative data lacking clinical variables from patient charts, which limits the ability to establish causality and only allows for associations between exposure groups and outcomes. Covariates such as homelessness or visit reasons were operationalized, which may be prone to measurement errors, and unobserved variables could potentially influence the associations between exposure groups and outcomes. Baseline variables are not static over time, and the study&#8217;s findings may primarily apply to similar hospital settings, thus limiting generalizability. Additionally, events occurring outside of HSN, such as deaths or admissions to other hospitals, were not captured, although the nearest acute care facility is approximately 150 km away. Other limitations include the lack of generalizability to other care settings including those without addiction medicine consult services and addiction medicine units.</p><p>Selection bias may also be present, as individuals who seek care at the ED may differ in important ways from those who avoid or delay care. Furthermore, diagnostic coding may not fully capture the clinical complexity or context of substance-related presentations, introducing potential misclassification bias. These factors may have influenced the observed associations between ED presentation type and hospitalization outcomes, and should be considered when interpreting the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our findings underscore the differing healthcare needs and challenges among individuals presenting to the ED with opioid use versus alcohol use. Despite similar 30-day revisit rates, the patterns of hospital admissions, the influence of additional ED visits, and the higher prevalence of homelessness among people presenting with opioid use highlight the unique and acute healthcare vulnerabilities of this population. Opioid-related presentations were more frequently associated with complex or acute health issues requiring hospitalization, likely reflecting the urgent and severe nature of complications linked to opioid use. In contrast, alcohol-related presentations may reflect more chronic patterns of care need.</p><p>These distinctions emphasize the importance of tailoring interventions to address the specific needs of these populations. For individuals with opioid use, strategies such as prompt initiation of medication-assisted therapy, addressing infections, and implementing integrated care models are crucial. For those presenting with alcohol use, managing withdrawal symptoms and chronic conditions like liver disease remains vital. Across both groups, addressing stigma, improving provider training, and enhancing continuity of care can reduce premature discharges and promote more equitable and effective care delivery.</p><p>The observed association between homelessness and higher 30-day ED revisit rates underscores the need for focused interventions targeting this key social determinant of health. Integrating housing supports with medical care such as hospital-based housing referral programs, medical respite care, and partnerships with community housing organizations can improve stability and reduce repeated acute care use. Tailoring discharge planning to include connections to housing services and harm reduction supports may also enhance continuity of care and reduce the cycle of ED utilization among unhoused individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed to the study.

This study provides valuable insights into the differing impacts of these substance use disorders on healthcare utilization. The methodology is sound, and the manuscript is well-organized. The conclusion&#8212;that individuals with OUD have a higher likelihood of inpatient admission and ED visits&#8212;emphasizes the need for targeted interventions and resources for this high-risk population. The authors appropriately acknowledge the study limitations, including challenges related to operationalizing measured constructs and the limited generalizability of findings. However, the method section requires further development. Additional detail is needed regarding the data collection and de-identification processes. How were the data obtained or extracted? Are these electronic medical record data? What specific measures were used to ensure participant anonymity (de-identification process)? Furthermore, the research questions and hypotheses are not clearly articulated. It is essential to explain why particular covariates were selected and how they were theoretically or empirically justified. Were these based on prior literature or pre-specified hypotheses? Clarifying which covariates were controlled for in the logistic regression analysis would also strengthen the rigor and transparency of the analytic approach.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>- Provide a clear and concise statement of your research questions and hypotheses in the introduction.</p><p>- Elaborate on your data collection and data de-identification process in the method section.</p><p>- Ensure your research questions and hypotheses are consistently addressed in the data analysis plan and results sections.</p><p>- Finally, clarify the rationale for covariate selection and specify which were included or controlled for in the regression models.</p><p>Overall Evaluation:</p><p>This manuscript offers important contributions to understanding the healthcare impact of OUD compared to alcohol use disorder. By strengthening the articulation of the study's research questions, hypotheses, data analysis plan, and the rationale behind methodological choices, the authors can improve the clarity, focus, and overall impact of the work.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Dear author, despite of the study design and limitations explained in the article.
