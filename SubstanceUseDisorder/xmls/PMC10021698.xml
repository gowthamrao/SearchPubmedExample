Differences in the availability and utilisation of morphine for people with pain and advanced cancer generate key global health inequalities [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2018, 79% of the world&#8217;s population, living mainly in low- and middle-income countries, consumed only 13% of the world&#8217;s consumption of licit morphine used for the management of pain [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

For complex socioeconomic reasons, over-consumption in some countries&#8211;primarily the United States&#8211;has caused significant suffering from addiction and through diversion of licit opioids to illicit channels since the 1990s [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Appropriate regulation of morphine must, therefore, achieve balance between availability for beneficial therapeutic purposes and restriction of illicit use.</p><p>Since 1961, morphine has been internationally regulated under the terms of the Single Convention on Narcotics, implementation of which is overseen by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

However, in 2012, to support use of the &#8216;Morbidity-based method,&#8217; the INCB published a recommended formula for calculating <italic toggle="yes">estimated requirements</italic> for morphine for people in pain with advanced cancer which appears responsive to changing clinical needs [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The INCB suggests that 80% of people with advanced cancer will require morphine, at an average of 67.5 mg per day in the last 90 days of life. Using numbers of people who die from cancer by country, it is therefore possible to calculate overall morphine needs for people with pain from advanced cancer by country using the INCB-endorsed approach.</p><p>In addition to <italic toggle="yes">Estimates of Requirements</italic>, countries submit their annual Consumption of controlled substances to the INCB. Methods with which individual countries calculate <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> are unreported. However, at the service-level, reporting of consumption to national regulators of controlled substances is a prerequisite to obtaining and maintaining a license to prescribe opioids. A controlled substance is regarded as &#8220;consumed&#8221; when it has been supplied to any person or enterprise for retail distribution, medical use or scientific research; and &#8220;consumption&#8221; is construed accordingly [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The Lancet Commission on Pain and Palliative Care applied INCB assumptions measuring the difference between palliative care-estimated needs and the quantity available for prescription for patients [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

This indicates that few countries avail of flexibilities within the <italic toggle="yes">estimates system</italic> to increase <italic toggle="yes">consumption</italic> beyond <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> and existing stocks and supplies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>Worldwide under-consumption of morphine is well reported, notably by the Lancet Commission on Pain and Palliative Care [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the role of <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> in relation to reported under-<italic toggle="yes">consumption</italic> has not been previously explored empirically. Although morphine is indicated for a number of clinical problems (e.g. trauma), the INCB only publishes guidance on how to calculate <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> for people who died with moderate-severe cancer-related pain (80% of people who die from cancer will require 67.5 mg per day for 90 days). We therefore present a &#8216;best case scenario&#8217; for the prospects of people who die from advanced cancer receiving morphine over time. Legitimate needs for morphine for other medical purposes should be considered as additional to our calculations.</p><p>Our analysis indicates most countries worldwide systematically submit <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> for morphine guaranteed not to meet the needs of people who die from cancer and that <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> contextualise inadequate <italic toggle="yes">consumption</italic>. This means countries submitting <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> insufficient to meet clinical needs are guaranteed to make inadequate morphine available for prescribing in that year.</p><p>We identify startling stability over twenty years in proportions of countries submitting inadequate <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic>. In a twenty year period, the proportion of countries submitting <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> which could feasibly meet &gt;100% of <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> for people who die from cancer increased only from 16% to 30% between 1997 and 2017. In every included year within our sample globally, &gt;70% of countries were guaranteed to provide inadequate availability of morphine for people with moderate-severe pain in advanced cancer.</p><p>Our model shows that the proportion of <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> for morphine of people who died from advanced cancer feasibly met by <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> rose from 86% in 1997 to 701% in 2017. This means that some countries have increased the proportions of <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> feasibly met by <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic>, with additional morphine for people with other clinical conditions. However, the vast majority of increased <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> has occurred in HICs and global inequity has not reduced. In HICs, between 1997 and 2017, <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> for morphine increased from 9,672kg to 13,219kg, however, <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> increased from 20,795kg to 255,012kg. This huge discrepancy indicates potential overuse of morphine in HICs, that a significant amount of requirements are for indications other than cancer pain, or, that the formula for calculating needs of people who die from cancer is a vast underestimation.</p><p>Of the three approaches to calculating country <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> recommended by the INCB [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.box001" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>], the apparent stability of inadequate <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> makes it likely that most countries use the consumption-based method, which uses previous consumption levels to estimate future <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic>. This means that historic (inadequate) consumption is used to estimate future <italic toggle="yes">requirements</italic>, systematising a cycle of inadequate availability and utilisation of morphine [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We conclude that for the majority of countries worldwide, either the methods of <italic toggle="yes">estimating requirements</italic> relative to need have not improved in the last twenty years or no progress has been made in terms of system capacity to ensure safety of the supply chain.</p><p>Inadequate <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> contextualise endemic under-consumption of morphine in most countries worldwide. Between 1997 and 2017, countries reporting consumption sufficient to meet &gt;100 of <italic toggle="yes">calculated needs</italic> of people who died from cancer, increased only from 13% in 1997, to 19% in 2017. This means in 2017, 81% of countries reported consumption levels guaranteed to provide inadequate availability of morphine for people with moderate-severe pain in advanced cancer.</p><p>The stability in global inequity of access to pain relief suggests that the <italic toggle="yes">Estimates system</italic> is not succeeding in its purpose as a pre-requisite of ensuring availability [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lack of apparent progress in improving proportions of <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> met by <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">consumption</italic> over 20 years should be of concern to patients&#8217; advocates, clinicians and policy makers. Of further concern, there is no apparent immediate increase in proportions of need met, following the commitment of countries to ensure access to pain relief as part of the 2014 World Health Assembly Resolution strengthen palliative care as a component of comprehensive health care.</p><p>Since 2016, the INCB has supported countries in improving their <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> through the INCB Learning program [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It will be important to evaluate this program as to its usefulness in improving the functioning of the <italic toggle="yes">estimates system</italic>. Publication of <italic toggle="yes">calculated needs</italic> alongside country <italic toggle="yes">requirements</italic> would highlight gaps between need and provision and both drive countries accountability to meet the pain treatment needs of their populations and guard against overestimation, which risks inappropriate over access.</p><p>If countries take measures to improve appropriate access to morphine, increased <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> will be the first indication of potential changes in adequacy of consumption. Without reform, trends of inadequate <italic toggle="yes">estimation of requirements</italic> identified by our study, contextualising under (and over) access to morphine appear likely to continue, leaving millions suffering avoidably.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Our data do not allow us to infer that in countries estimating &gt;100% of <italic toggle="yes">calculated needs</italic>, all people with advanced cancer will receive morphine appropriately. However, absolute conclusions can be reached for countries reporting <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> which feasibly meet &#8804;100% of <italic toggle="yes">calculated needs</italic>.</p><p>Nevertheless, our analysis uses assumptions which introduce systematic over- and under-calculation of needs for morphine of people who died from cancer. Morphine is indicated for several clinical problems (e.g. trauma, [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] post-operative analgesia) in addition to people who die from cancer [<xref rid="pgph.0000533.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, given no data are available as to the purposes for which <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> are made nor consumed, our analysis assumes that all <italic toggle="yes">estimates of requirements</italic> and country consumption are for the purposes of treating people who die from advanced cancer. Additionally, much morphine worldwide is used in the manufacture of other medicines which means that clinical availability will be over-estimated. Additionally, as it is defined by 1961 Convention, a drug shall be regarded as &#8220;consumed&#8221; when it has been supplied to any person or enterprise for retail distribution, medical use or scientific research&#8211;meaning again, that we overcalculate proportions of need feasibly met by consumption.</p><p>Population estimates of people who died from cancer are also likely to systematically under-estimate mortality, due to under-registration of cancer as cause of death. By using Income Group as our unit of analysis, our approach also does not identify individual countries who may have either increased (or decreased) proportions of need met by <italic toggle="yes">requirements</italic>/consumption.</p><p>Additionally, our use of a repeated time-series approach means that total countries included at each time point differ by year. This explains some of the fluctuation in our outcome variables presented in <xref rid="pgph.0000533.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For example, there is notable fluctuation in countries&#8217; population, <italic toggle="yes">calculated need</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">estimate of requirements</italic> in low-income countries, between 1997, 2002 and 2007. This is accounted for by an increase of six countries in the sample from 1997 to 2002 and a significant increase in India&#8217;s estimates of requirement between the dates, from 400kg in 1997, to 10,000kg in 2002. India was included as a lower-middle income country by 2002, where after total estimate of requirement in low-income countries dropped to similar levels seen in 1997 and remained consistent.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the systematic biases mentioned and the clear trends of inadequate <italic toggle="yes">estimations of requirement</italic> and reported consumption, we offer a starting point for consideration of estimates of <italic toggle="yes">requirements</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">consumption</italic>, in context of <italic toggle="yes">calculated needs</italic> to drive the accountability of global regulation and countries worldwide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0000533.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Proportion of included countries reporting consumption which could feasibly meet &gt; or &#8804; 100% of calculated need for morphine of people with advanced cancer, 1997&#8211;2017.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0000533.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0000533.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Proportion of included countries within income groups reporting consumption which could feasibly meet or &#8804; or &gt;100% of calculated needs by year, 1997&#8211;2017.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0000533.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0000533.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Proportion of calculated need feasibly met by consumption, 1997&#8211;2017.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0000533.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the INCB for responding to our request and providing estimated requirements and consumption data for 1997.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0000533.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Overall</p><p>This is an important work and highlights a neglected issue in LMIC context. Overall paper is hard to read and follow as the terms need, requirement, theoretical availability and consumption are very hard to understand. Authors need to give clear definitions and use consistent language to make it understandable. It will useful to use only 2-3 key indicators to explain trends. The paper uses very important concepts from supply chain management which may not be well understood by medical / public health audience.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>&#8226; Introduce the audience to key supply chain management concepts relevant to the paper such as forecasting, availability and consumption.</p><p>&#8226; Operational definitions in methods: Estimated need, estimated requirement, theoretical availability and consumption should be clearly defined in the methods section.
