Initially, 4078 prescriptions were excluded because they were canceled (n&#8201;=&#8201;352, 1.7%), an exact duplicate based on prescription ID (n&#8201;=&#8201;52, 0.3%), or medications that did not align with the study&#8217;s focus on long-term opioid therapy for CNCP (injections, administered during acute encounters, or one-time post-operative doses; n&#8201;=&#8201;3674, 18.2%), leaving 16&#160;071 opioid prescriptions cleaned according to the methods described in this paper. Of these, 1207 (7.5%) prescriptions were removed because MME could not be calculated due to incomplete data, or they were determined to be erroneous duplicates. After cleaning, 14&#160;864 (92.5%) prescriptions remained for analysis (<xref rid="ooaf053-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Calculation of MME</title><p>While calculating the MME for each prescription, several challenges were encountered related to missing frequency, quantity, or dose fields that required a series of assumptions (<xref rid="ooaf053-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>). An overarching assumption was made that all prescriptions were filled and that patients took them as prescribed and to completion. While impossible to know how medications were taken, all prescriptions are available to patients for use and so were included. The most common resolutions included assuming the medication was taken at the maximum frequency for pro re nata (PRN) prescriptions (59.5% of 16&#160;071 prescriptions), assuming a 30-day supply when frequency instructions or quantity dispensed were missing (16.9%), and deriving quantity dispensed when not provided (6.1%). When the dose was a range (eg, 30&#8211;60 mL or 2&#8211;3 tablets) it was assumed that the lowest dose was taken (5.3%). It was also assumed that all EHR-indicated refills for Schedule III (eg, acetaminophen with codeine, buprenorphine) and IV (eg, tramadol) opioids, for which refills are allowed,<xref rid="ooaf053-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> were filled and taken accordingly (4.1%). Lastly, certain medications required special considerations to calculate MME due to their unique routes of administration or biochemical properties that affect dosing (<xref rid="ooaf053-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>, #8&#8211;12, #14; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Because methadone has a long and unpredictable half-life, its conversion factor is non-linear, increasing at higher doses. Solutions, typically prescribed in units of milliliters, had to be converted into milligrams to calculate MME. The conversion factor for buprenorphine patches is multiplied by the length of wear (7 days).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="ooaf053-T1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Challenges related to deriving days&#8217; supply and daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) for a single opioid prescription from the electronic health record.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Challenge</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Resolution</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Example</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The most common prescription-level challenges were missing frequency or quantity dispensed. A potential solution that could be implemented within EHRs is to make certain fields required before a clinician can submit a prescription. Some discrepancies can be explained by differences in practice across sites. For instance, only one site excluded canceled prescriptions from their datamart. More complex issues were those involving imprecise start dates and apparent duplicate or overlapping entries, which may be attributable to providers&#8217; prescribing patterns and individual patient circumstances. Study clinicians confirmed prescriptions that were likely spurious and should be removed from the derivation of longitudinal MME.</p><p>Limitations include basing MME on EHR prescriptions rather than those actually filled by a pharmacy, which would be more accurate. Additionally, lack of opioid prescriptions within a site&#8217;s EHR does not necessarily mean that the patient stopped taking them, as it is possible they changed healthcare systems. For these reasons, opioid researchers often use claims data from pharmacy records of filled prescriptions.<xref rid="ooaf053-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, claims data were not readily available for this clinical trial because patients use different insurers. Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are state-level databases that track controlled substance prescriptions, making them an ideal source. However, they are highly restricted and their data are deidentified, resulting in limited use for research purposes.<xref rid="ooaf053-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Further investigation is needed to compare accuracy of data between EHRs, PDMPs, and pharmacy prescription fills to determine the most efficient and reliable process for monitoring long-term opioid use. This is the first description of EHR opioid prescription data cleaning methods, so results cannot be compared against existing literature.</p><p>After completion of this study, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released a new longitudinal MME calculator that considers multiple prescriptions over the same period and includes the conversion factors for all opioid classes.<xref rid="ooaf053-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, this tool does not address how to clean and prepare prescription data. This paper fills this gap to ensure that quality prescription data can be fed into such tools for accurate MME derivation.</p><p>Electronic opioid prescription data may be more accurate than patient self-report, though the literature comparing the two are limited. When research is focused on opioid tapering, self-report may be biased downward. Patients may also not be able to provide precise prescription details to accurately derive MME due to recall bias.<xref rid="ooaf053-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> An important strength of EHR prescriptions is that many systems require prescribers to enter information from lists of available options, maintaining quality. A standardized datamart supported by sites within a research network further simplifies the standardization process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, EHR prescription data were used to standardize opioid doses and calculate longitudinal daily doses across participants. However, the programmers identified issues with prescription data that prevented MME derivation or had implausible dosing patterns, highlighting why prescription data cannot be taken at face value. An SME and prescribing physicians were consulted to develop a novel set of assumptions to systematically address these challenges. Other researchers who use EHRs for opioid prescription studies may use these steps to assure standardization and reduce risk of inaccuracies in prescribing patterns; however, these methods should not be considered definitive. Failure to clean and understand opioid prescription data invites a high risk of inaccurately evaluating longitudinal patterns and can potentially harm the management of patients&#8217; health. Despite these challenges, electronic prescription data and MME estimations are valuable for both clinical practice and research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>ooaf053_Supplementary_Data</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ooaf053_supplementary_data.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the INSPIRE Study Team collaborators for their contributions.</p><p>INSPIRE study team collaborators:</p><p>Alyssa Anderson, BA<sup>1</sup>; Federica B.
