<bold>Background:</bold> Exposure <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> to certain medications can disrupt processes of fetal development, including brain development, leading to a continuum of neurodevelopmental difficulties. Recognizing the deficiency of neurodevelopmental investigations within pregnancy pharmacovigilance, an international Neurodevelopmental Expert Working Group was convened to achieve consensus regarding the core neurodevelopmental outcomes, optimization of methodological approaches and barriers to conducting pregnancy pharmacovigilance studies with neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> A modified Delphi study was undertaken based on stakeholder and expert input. Stakeholders (patient, pharmaceutical, academic and regulatory) were invited to define topics, pertaining to neurodevelopmental investigations in medication-exposed pregnancies. Experts were identified for their experience regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following medicinal, substances of misuse or environmental exposures <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic>. Two questionnaire rounds and a virtual discussion meeting were used to explore expert opinion on the topics identified by the stakeholders.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-five experts, from 13 countries and professionally diverse backgrounds took part in the development of 11 recommendations. The recommendations focus on the importance of neurodevelopment as a core feature of pregnancy pharmacovigilance, the timing of study initiation and a core set of distinct but interrelated neurodevelopmental skills or diagnoses which require investigation. Studies should start in infancy with an extended period of investigation into adolescence, with more frequent sampling during rapid periods of development. Additionally, recommendations are made regarding optimal approach to neurodevelopmental outcome measurement, comparator groups, exposure factors, a core set of confounding and mediating variables, attrition, reporting of results and the required improvements in funding for potential later emerging effects. Different study designs will be required depending on the specific neurodevelopmental outcome type under investigation and whether the medicine in question is newly approved or already in widespread use.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> An improved focus on neurodevelopmental outcomes is required within pregnancy pharmacovigilance.

Fetal brain development <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic>, although often overlooked, is also susceptible to the effects of a teratogenic exposure and can range from observable structural alterations through to functional difficulties (e.g., intellectual functioning) with no associated macroscopically visible brain abnormalities (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Barone, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rodier, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Grandjean and Landrigan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2010</xref>). Perturbed development of the neuronal architecture can lead to a myriad of childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties including delays in early language and motor skill acquisition, lower IQ, poorer educational outcomes, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Meredith et al., 2015</xref>).

Neurodevelopmental deficits associated with such exposures have been shown to have substantial life changing and lifelong implications, often with no corrective treatments available (although early intervention may ameliorate certain outcomes). There are therefore high social and emotional impacts for affected families, as well as the considerable financial implications with social care and healthcare related costs.</p><p>In addition to the severity of the impact, the NEWG noted that neurodevelopmental deficits can be seen in the absence of, or more frequently than, structural anomalies (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>), and these deficits can present at a lower dose threshold than that required for structural anomalies (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>).

For example, central nervous system acting medications were specifically highlighted by the NEWG as medications which should be prioritized for routine human (e.g., clinical or epidemiological) investigation at point of market authorization/approval (96% agreement), due to their mechanistic routes of action and that several potent neurodevelopmental teratogens have been found within this class of medications.</p><p>More challenging, is that these criteria should also be applied, to already approved and used medicines. Most currently approved medicines have little to no data pertaining to neurodevelopmental outcomes, even where there are known structural or physical risks, or for medication classes with known risk of neurodevelopmental impact, such as the antiseizure medications (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2021</xref>).

Developmental trajectories across a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes were identified by the NEWG as being susceptible to alterations via exposure to teratogens during pregnancy. The group strongly concluded (92% agreement) that no single neurodevelopmental outcome was able to summarize functioning across other neurodevelopmental areas. Whilst there is a degree of co-occurrence across certain neurodevelopmental outcomes there is also independence, which was recognized. For example, children with intellectual difficulties have a greater chance of also having a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum condition but, these conditions may also occur separately in the context of typical functioning in other neurodevelopmental domains. Further, different neural networks and the functions they support may vary in their sensitivity, or timing of their sensitivity, to <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> exposure to different agents, leading to specific neurodevelopmental profiles (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson and Jacobson, 1996</xref>). This point is highlighted by the cognitive profiles of children exposed to isotretinoin and valproate, where isotretinoin is associated with relatively spared verbal functioning (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Lammer, 1993</xref>), whilst this is a particular area of difficulty within the valproate-associated phenotype (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bromley et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, measurement within a single prioritized area of functioning cannot provide information that generalizes as an assessment of the integrity of functioning in other areas. Our recommendation is that measurement across multiple neurodevelopmental domains must be employed to avoid erroneous conclusions based on insufficient information.</p><p>Two distinct sub-types of neurodevelopmental outcomes emerged from the three rounds and are conceptualized as functional skills or clinical disorders (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Forns et al., 2012</xref>) and are displayed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> along with levels of agreement. Functional skills include abilities, capacities, and knowledge acquired during the maturation of the brain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Forns et al., 2012</xref>) and are often only identified through specialized clinical evaluations. Functional skills such as cognition, including intellectual abilities, language, attention and memory functioning, received the highest support for investigation (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), due to their observed sensitivity to several teratogenic exposures; both from medications and other exposure types (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Lammer, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mattson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Julvez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Freire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Bromley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Munoz-Rocha et al., 2018</xref>). Clinical disorders (e.g., autistic spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) refer to the presence of a discrete set of predefined symptoms, which may sit across a range of different functional skills and likely represent the most severe end of a broad symptom continuum. High ratings of support (87.5%) were also given for the investigation of clinical neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses by the NEWG (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which may sit within a broader set of symptoms associated with the exposure. As well as primary or direct impacts on neurodevelopmental outcomes, it was also noted that there are possible secondary or indirect impacts on everyday life, and these too should be considered for investigation. For example, a medication capable of inducing alterations in the development of the neuronal architecture may lead to poorer academic outcomes through reduced cognitive (e.g., intellectual, memory, executive) functioning or capacity.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2" orientation="portrait"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p>Neurodevelopmental functioning domains and clinical disorders known to be vulnerable to disruption through neurotoxin exposure and domains voted to be part of the core domain set.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Domain</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Final level of agreement<xref rid="Tfn2" ref-type="table-fn">

A similar consensus initiative focusing on outcomes in children from vaccinated cohorts, concluded that under the age of 5&#160;years motor (fine and gross), language (receptive, expressive) and cognitive skills should be considered as key emerging domains which require comprehensive investigation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez et al., 2019</xref>). However, in school-aged children a wider range of neurodevelopmental processes will have emerged and therefore the range of neurodevelopmental outcomes should reflect this maturation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>This core outcome set for neurodevelopmental investigations should be viewed as the minimum evidence base required to reliably assess neurodevelopmental risk or relative safety. At an individual study level, it may not always be possible to include measurement of all these neurodevelopmental outcomes, but initiation of measurement of a broad range of domains should be considered for medication exposures, as in recommendations for other exposures (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Grandjean and Landrigan, 2006</xref>).

However, the NEWG identified principles relating to the different aspects of neurodevelopmental study designs, which should be optimized where possible.</p><sec id="s3-4-1"><title>3.4.1 The measurement of neurodevelopmental outcomes</title><table-wrap position="float" id="udT4" orientation="portrait"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommendation 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neurodevelopmental outcomes are diverse and require different measurement approaches that are sensitive to deviations over time.

However, concepts were identified which were regarded as important by the NEWG to provide higher quality measurement, with a reduced chance of measurement error. Features of optimal measurement of neurodevelopmental outcomes (receiving = /&gt;80% agreement) included:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#8226; Direct assessment of children by expert/highly trained assessors,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; A standardized assessment of all exposed and comparator children,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; Use of standardized and validated assessment measures (for example a psychometric instruments or diagnostic criteria),</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#8226; Blinding or masking of the assessors to the exposure group/history.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Assessments conducted blinded to the exposure status of the child reduce the potential influence of rater bias, although it remains underused on PregPV studies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hjorth et al., 2019</xref>). Conducting the same assessment across all included study participants improves measurement sensitivity, and the use of a measure with standardized administration procedures reduces measurement variation and error. Utilizing highly trained assessors was rated as important to overcome the challenges of engaging children in an assessment and for improving the quality of the data (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There was discussion in Round 3 around the utilization of parent ratings on standardized questionnaires. The role of parent-completed screening questionnaire has been subject to some controversy with regards to whether they represent conclusive level evidence (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Damkier et al., 2015</xref>). NEWG discussions recognized that parents are not blinded to exposure history, may be anxious about their child&#8217;s outcome, and may interpret the standardized questions differently and that these lead to potential biases and interrater variances. However, it was also considered that parent completed assessment via questionnaires were important for certain outcomes (e.g., social skills, adaptive behavior). For example, social skills are unlikely to be observed optimally in the unfamiliar environment of a clinic or research room, particularly given that assessments usually involve the child and one adult rather than a group of peers. Likewise, obtaining valid young infant assessments can be challenging and supplementing with parent ratings can improve the ecological validity of the data. Therefore, although parent-completed questionnaires alone were not accepted by the NEWG to provide <italic toggle="yes">definitive data</italic> there was recognition that parent ratings were valuable for certain outcomes (e.g., infant development, adaptive behavior, social skills) and for screening activities, particularly in large cohorts. However, results arising from initial screening activities using parent-completed questionnaires in isolation would warrant complimentary blinded, objective investigations.</p><p>The secondary use of clinical or educational data collected for administrative or insurance purposes often used in epidemiological PregPV research was viewed with sensitivity concerns by the NEWG. In Round 2 only 25% of experts &#8216;agreed&#8217; or &#8216;strongly agreed&#8217; that secondary use of health record data would provide conclusive evidence in isolation. Concerns centered around the sensitivity and specificity of the data due to variability in diagnostic processes across clinicians, accuracy and frequency of reporting, a lack of active blinding of the clinician/assessor and that only a subset of the medication-exposed group is referred for and therefore receives a diagnostic assessment or review. It was also noted that such data would be biased towards those with more severe phenotypes, would not provide any data on sub-diagnostic level difficulties which may still have an impact on daily functioning and therefore represent important PregPV information. Following Round 3 discussions regarding the role of secondary use of routine healthcare data, there was consensus from the NEWG (88%) that utilization of such data sources were an important PregPV tool, particularly for detecting signals of poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes or for when larger populations are required (e.g., for rare diagnoses/outcomes). Where an elevated risk of a clinical neurodevelopmental disorder is identified, it should be considered that a continuum of symptoms sub-diagnosis threshold will exist and should be investigated.</p><p>No blanket recommendations are made regarding individual measurement approaches or specific tests or measurement tools due to the different testing requirements required through the lifespan, different tests and versions available internationally, and the possible differences in sensitivity of specific assessments/measures across different exposure groups. Research groups, pharmaceutical industry, and regulators are strongly encouraged to collaborate with professionals with academic or clinical expertise in the areas of neurodevelopmental functioning under investigation to develop a sensitive approach to measurement selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-2"><title>3.4.2 Exposure variables</title><table-wrap position="float" id="udT5" orientation="portrait"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommendation 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factors related to the medication exposure including the dose, gestational timing, duration, and route of administration during pregnancy should be key considerations and study designs should take heterogeneity and confounding by indication into account</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Consistent with other areas of pharmacovigilance and previous positions on neurodevelopmental outcomes in PregPV investigations (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Brent, 2004</xref>) the NEWG recommend several key factors relating to medicine exposure that require consideration in studies investigating neurodevelopmental outcomes. These include:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Dose of the exposure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Gestational timing of the exposure (accounting for exposure half-life).</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Duration of the exposure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Medication changes (including stopping or starting and compliance).</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Route of administration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Mechanism of the drug or chemical exposure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Continued exposure via breastfeeding.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Inadequate consideration of these aspects of the exposure could introduce important misclassification biases, influence the findings (bias towards or away from the null), and potentially impact the generalizability of study results. The development of the brain is an evolving set of processes with different points of vulnerability at different gestational times and postnatally (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Barone, 2000</xref>). Therefore, different timings and/or duration of the exposure may lead to different neurodevelopmental risks and severity of such alterations (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>). Medications where there are high rates of short-term use or discontinuation are likely to be most difficult to investigate, due to the heterogeneity of exposure windows across participants. Dose of any chemical exposure is a key aspect of toxicological impact (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wilson, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Riley, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>) and medications are no different. Exposure to valproate for example demonstrates a dose sensitive risk profile for both major congenital anomalies (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Samren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Tomson et al., 2018</xref>) and neurodevelopmental outcomes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Meador et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, approaches should be undertaken to ensure that these important factors inherent in the medication exposure are included in all PregPV studies. Efforts have been made recently to develop core data elements for both PregPV primary and secondary data collection approaches (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Damase-Michel and Wurst, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The methods of collection of data regarding the medication exposure were rated by members of the NEWG.

Investigation or sampling intervals should be more frequent during periods of rapid development or after signals of early developmental deviations</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Assessment in infancy allows for early detection of deviations from the normal developmental trajectory. In the NEWG, there was unanimous recognition that neurodevelopmental impairments may emerge over time and therefore neurodevelopmental surveillance required a protracted period of investigation. The NEWG unanimously agreed that investigations into neurodevelopmental outcomes should include infant neurodevelopmental outcomes on the basis that major human neurobehavioral teratogens such as alcohol, valproate and isotretinoin have induced detectable delays in infant milestone attainment (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Lammer, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bromley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2011</xref>). Medication exposures with early deviations from typical developmental trajectories, or where there are signals from screening activities, should be further investigated with urgency using optimized investigations, as defined by the NEWG. Detecting early emerging patterns of risk are useful on an individual level (early referral for intervention), but also raise early warnings to regulators and clinicians, ultimately leading to fewer children being exposed to a higher risk medication than clinically necessary.</p><p>However, neurodevelopmental investigations must continue beyond the infant years to allow for the full delineation of the impact which may only become visible with maturation of different neurodevelopmental functions and/or improvement in the sensitivity of measurement. It is recognized that brain development extends into early adulthood (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Barone, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Arain et al., 2013</xref>) and with this consideration there was consensus that comprehensive investigations should include investigation up to at least 16 years of age (86% supported this length of investigational follow up). Measurement sensitivity increases with the child&#8217;s age (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson and Jacobson, 1996</xref>) and terminating investigations while a developmental skill/function is early in its emergence may not provide reliable results as significant neurodevelopmental deficits may emerge in one or more areas later in the developmental trajectory (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The age intervals of follow up for both primary data collection and secondary use of routine health data is recommended to vary by outcome type. There was consensus that intervals between investigations should be narrower in the preschool years, due to this being a period of rapid developmental change, which may allow for early identification of any divergent developmental trajectories. Assessment or analysis in the school aged years can have wider assessment intervals, but there was a recognition that when early developmental deviations were noted the follow up should be more frequent and other areas of neurodevelopmental outcome also investigated.</p><p>Finally, as per other similar consensus recommendations (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez et al., 2019</xref>), studies employing longitudinal follow ups at different ages were unanimously supported here. Longitudinal designs allow for the timing and interval recommendations above to be implemented, with each additional assessment allowing for findings from earlier timepoints to be strengthened or challenged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-4"><title>3.4.4 Recruitment, cohort ascertainment and attrition</title><table-wrap position="float" id="udT7" orientation="portrait"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommendation 7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research can be improved by using a prospective design, representative samples of women using the medication and through limited attrition which is not systematic and imbalanced across groups</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The NEWG noted that prospective ascertainment of cohorts and recording of data was critical to optimize and reduce bias in neurodevelopmental outcome research. Establishing cohorts of children with a target medication exposure with contemporaneous recording of data can come both from studies using routinely recorded health data and primary data collection studies which directly recruit women during their pregnancies for longitudinal follow up during the postnatal years. Cohorts ascertained specifically for a specific research question offer the opportunity to collect data prospectively with methodological standardization of both procedures and measurements but can be challenged by poor or slow recruitment and high attrition levels (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Charlton and de Vries, 2016</xref>). Attrition is a reality in longitudinal research when the observed outcomes are distal to the exposure event (pregnancy) but differ between primary and secondary data studies. For example, in the latter, attrition is generally lower and more a consequence of population movement between exposure types, movement between different healthcare providers who may not all provide data to the research dataset being utilized and via missing covariate values (e.g., nicotine use, family history of neurodevelopmental disorders). The NEWG gained consensus on the following statements relating to attrition:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Attrition is an inherent aspect of longitudinal designs when neurodevelopmental measurements are administered directly to participants or where information on health and neurodevelopment is sought from the participant or health professional records over an extended period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- The influence of attrition is a larger threat to the validity of the results when it is systematic and imbalanced across included groups, and this needs to be considered when interpreting study findings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Consensus on acceptable levels of attrition in longitudinal studies was difficult to achieve, and the need to adopt a pragmatic and realistic figure based on published and first-hand experience was recognized. Attrition rates of no greater than 20%&#8211;30% received support from 79% of the NEWG as being acceptable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Statistical methods investigating and addressing differences in demographics between the final study sample, and those lost to follow-up should be employed and reported.</p></list-item></list>

A co-recruited comparator group of pregnant women without the maternal disease and no exposure to a known teratogenic medication was also identified as important for situations where there is a potential for similar levels of risk from different treatments under investigation or for when there is potential risk associated with the maternal disease which needs to be quantified.

Sixty percent of the NEWG felt that there was a failure to prioritize neurodevelopmental outcomes within PregPV and that this was a barrier. However, challenges around the cost of neurodevelopmental investigations (92%) and funding such initiatives (84%) were by far the largest barriers identified. In Round 1, within-study design barriers such as recruitment, attrition and a lack of expertise were identified. However, 88% of experts felt that many of the in-study barriers could be overcome by using optimal study designs with improved funding. Over half of the NEWG felt that a lack of consensus regarding optimal study design (60%) and a lack of expertise internationally were also barriers.</p><p>Here we highlight that, despite the possible severity of impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes which place financial burdens on both families and society, the most common barrier to progress in obtaining appropriate evidence is funding. Optimal neurodevelopmental investigation requires adequate resources over a relatively long period, but the expense of these investigations should be weighed against the long-term cost to the individual and society where the neuroteratogenic effects of a medicine are undetected for considerable time periods. By reducing the time to detect signals, we stand to not only reduce the overall burden by reducing the number of exposures but also by providing early intervention to affected children to offset later emerging or cumulative impairments.</p><p>Current sources of funding for PregPV work comes from market authorization holders (pharmaceutical companies), public health bodies (select countries), government public health agencies and academic grant schemes. The delays in obtaining neurodevelopmental outcome data for specific medicines clearly illustrates the insufficiency of the current <italic toggle="yes">ad hoc</italic> funding model; a point made previously in relation to the antiseizure medications (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Meador and Loring, 2016</xref>). Sustainable funding for PregPV studies was highlighted in an EMA public workshop (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2020</xref>) and this NEWG adds to this call for improved mechanisms to fund neurodevelopmental outcome PregPV.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>4 Discussion</title><p>In recent years, it has become apparent to academics, regulators, patients, pharmaceutical industry and healthcare professionals alike that the reproductive safety of medications cannot be assured without information about long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. This consensus guideline provides 11 expert recommendations (<xref rid="s12" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) regarding the integration and improvement of neurodevelopmental outcome investigations in routine PregPV initiatives. These recommendations are made with the desire to move forward to achieve robust evidence regarding neurodevelopmental risk more rapidly, thereby reducing the historical latency seen previously in medication safety processes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2020</xref>). Given the potential severity of the impact on brain development and functioning, there is an imperative to reduce the time taken to determine potential risk.</p><p>Randomized clinical trials to specifically investigate potential harms to fetal development are not possible, therefore observational trials are required. Given observational trials are susceptible to unmeasured confounding, complementary methodological approaches and replication is required. We realize that the recommendations made here set a high bar; however, no single study is necessarily expected to be able to be optimized in every one of these areas. Instead, these recommendations should be addressed across a complementary set of studies which converge to form a comprehensive set of evidence on which clinical and regulatory decisions can be made and advice to patients given. Over 90% of the NEWG supported the statement that a triangulation of evidence will be required from different sources and study designs to provide an optimal set of data on which to base conclusions upon. Data from preclinical/animal models, clinical and epidemiological studies are all required to inform each other and complement each other&#8217;s methodological strengths and weaknesses. Preclinical studies, allow tighter control over exposure factors (e.g., dose, duration, timing), the postnatal environment and behavioral experiments (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Barone, 2000</xref>) and remove any potential influence from the maternal indication for treatment (e.g., disease or disorder). Prospective observational cohorts employing direct, blinded, and standardized psychometric assessments of included children, for example, offer unparalleled precision in measurement of the outcome and reduced bias due to standardization and blinding procedures. However, they are often at risk of selection biases and attrition. Routine use of healthcare data or educational data from large populations, on the other hand, allows for large and less selective populations to be investigated, does not require active participation from families and has less attrition.</p><p>The specific neurodevelopmental outcomes under investigation however may lend themselves more readily to specific data types or investigational approaches. Functional skills for example, such as intelligence or memory functioning are rarely measured routinely in healthcare settings but are frequently measured in the context of cohort studies. On the other hand, dichotomous outcomes, such as the presence or absence of a clinical diagnosis (e.g., ASD or ADHD) or examination grades, require a larger sample (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1983</xref>), thus lending themselves towards secondary use of population level administrative records (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hjorth et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, whether the medicinal product is newly approved or already in widespread use will also be an important consideration in study design. Investigations into a newly approved medications, where there are a small number of exposed children initially, will be optimally investigated by designs with increased measurement sensitivity, which are accurate in the context of smaller group sizes and are able to detect early developmental deviations in infancy.</p><p>There are many medications currently in use which would be deemed important for investigation by the criteria in Recommendation 2. Whilst this poses practical and financial challenges for regulators and market authorization holders the importance of these outcomes and their potential life changing, and lifelong impacts mean that a multi stakeholder plan to address the knowledge gap for medications in widespread use is urgently required. An absence of evidence of fetal risk should not be confused as being evidence of fetal safety.</p><p>There was a strength of feeling in the NEWG that current funding models are a significant barrier to timely evidence generation. Regulators require companies with market authorization for the product to conduct or fund investigations, whilst clinical or academic based work is often subject to time limited and inconsistent funding streams; neither of which lead to trusted and timely evidence generation. Change is required to move forward with improving PregPV research with neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p><p>In summary, international medicines regulators should instruct post market authorization requirements which address each of the core neurodevelopmental outcomes. These investigations should be varied in their study designs to allow for the recommended triangulation of evidence, consider trajectories of skill maturation and the point at market authorization a medicine is at.</p><p>Our recommendations are the first regarding neurodevelopmental outcome PregPV investigations for medications and align with previous consensus initiatives regarding childhood vaccines and neonatal clinical trials with regards to early onset of investigations, longitudinal follow up, and standardized assessments (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marlow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez et al., 2019</xref>) and those for environmental neurotoxicology investigations, including the investigation of a range of neurodevelopmental domains, longitudinal design, confounding and mediator considerations, bias minimization and the emergence of effects later in the developmental trajectory (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amler et al., 2006</xref>). These recommendations should be utilized in conjunction with regulatory guidance (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Medicines and Healthcare Regulation Authority, 2021</xref>) on the undertaking of PregPV investigations to build evidence consensus for specific treatments.</p><p>Strengths of this work include its novelty, stakeholder engagement to determine information gaps and a rigorous Delphi approach to develop consensus. Included experts were from environmental and substances of abuse neurotoxicology research groups as well as PregPV researchers. Both academic and clinical experts were from different countries and were experienced in different research designs and data sources. We acknowledge however that these guidelines however are limited in certain areas. Firstly, opinions were ascertained on optimal features of investigations which were not bound by feasibility constraints, different PregPV stakeholders are encouraged to review how these recommendations can inform their future work. Secondly, the incorporation of culturally and linguistically sensitive measurements is a further important consideration when designing studies across different countries and cultures (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez et al., 2019</xref>) but was not covered here. Thirdly, the NEWG were not able to produce guidance on a range of additional outstanding issues including harmonization of data collection, measurement choice/standardization or optimal statistical analysis approaches. It is recognized that these are required and should be addressed in future expert consensus work. Finally, we were not able to take these 11 recommendations back to the original stakeholders or to collect wider endorsement prior to publication. However, it is the intention that these recommendations are the genesis of a wider conversation over the improvement of PregPV research where there are neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>The reproductive safety of medicines includes knowledge on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
