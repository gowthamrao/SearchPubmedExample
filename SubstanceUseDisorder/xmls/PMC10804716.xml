ACEs have a massive impact on future violence victimization and perpetration. They are also associated with lifelong mental and physical health consequences as well as premature mortality. The present study aimed to investigate the role of different ACEs among married mothers in predicting the risk of child abuse perpetration in offspring.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 mothers of children aged 2&#8211;12 years attending family health centres in Alexandria. The mothers completed a predesigned interview questionnaire on sociodemographic data and data related to ACEs, spousal violence, and child abuse perpetration. Suitable bivariate and multivariate statistical tests were used to analyse the collected data using version 20.0 of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Two-thirds of mothers (66.3%) reported ever having been exposed to any ACE, and 18.6% of them had experienced 3 or more ACEs. Psychological abuse (46%) and witnessing domestic violence (17%) were the most common. Psychological aggression (95.4%), minor physical assault (79%), and neglect (52%) were the most common forms of child abuse perpetrated by the mothers. The number of ACEs experienced by mothers showed a moderate positive significant correlation with the 5 forms of child abuse examined. Different ACEs, mother&#8217;s age, socioeconomic status, and current exposure to spousal violence were found to be independent predictors of different forms of child abuse (psychological aggression, neglect, minor physical assault, and severe physical assault).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Different practices of family violence are strongly connected throughout different stages of an individual&#8217;s life and across generations. Further understanding of the interconnections among forms of violence and addressing them should be prioritized. Additionally, concerted national strategies across all levels and sectors are needed to address this complex problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12905-024-02903-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)</kwd><kwd>Child abuse</kwd><kwd>Child maltreatment</kwd><kwd>Domestic violence</kwd><kwd>Spousal violence</kwd><kwd>Married mothers</kwd><kwd>Parenting practices</kwd><kwd>Egypt</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Alexandria University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Childhood experiences impact people&#8217;s health throughout their life course. During the past decade, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been increasingly regarded as an international public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ACEs are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0&#8211;17 years) and include experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect; witnessing violence in the home; and having a family member attempt or die by suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. </p><p id="Par7">In 2015, a Public Health Wales ACE survey conducted on 2,000 adult males and females aged 18&#8211;69 years revealed that 46.5% of participants had experienced at least one ACE before the age of 18 years, while 13.6% of them had experienced four or more ACEs. The rates of ACEs ranged from 4.6% for living with a drug-using household member to 22.8% for experiencing more than one episode of verbal abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. </p><p id="Par8">Research evidence has indicated that ACEs are associated with negative long-term health and behavioural outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exposure to childhood adversity has an impact on adult physical and mental health, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer, depression, suicide, and posttraumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Higher rates of ACEs are associated with high-risk behaviours, including smoking, heavy drinking, substance abuse, poor diet, and early unintended pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. </p><p id="Par9">In addition, ACEs increase the risk of violence victimization, perpetration and intergenerational transmission of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bellis et al. suggested that people who experience ACEs as children often end up raising their own children in households where ACEs are more common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such a cycle of childhood adversity can lock successive generations of families into poor health and antisocial behaviour for generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A 2014 UNICEF study reported that approximately three-quarters of children (76.3%) were corporally punished, which was significantly predicted by their mothers&#8217; childhood history of negative rearing experience and poor interparental relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. </p><p id="Par10">In Egypt, child abuse is evidently an escalating multifaceted problem. In 2018, severe physical disciplinary practices reached 45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], whereas earlier estimates reached 43% in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During the past few decades, stressful living conditions such as low income status, overcrowding and cultural and religious misconceptions that normalize violent disciplinary practices have contributed to the intergenerational transmission of violence against children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, Egyptian mothers are more forced than fathers to use these violent disciplinary practices because they believe that people will think they are unable to control their children&#8217;s misbehaviours if they do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Evidence from the 2014 Egyptian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) revealed that mothers who were exposed to ACE of witnessing spousal violence were 2&#8211;3 times more likely to slap, strike and shout at their children compared to mothers who were not exposed to such ACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. </p><p id="Par11">While most related research on the impact of ACEs on women&#8217;s health and well-being has focused on adults&#8217; physical and mental health consequences, few studies have investigated parenting practices, the transgenerational continuity of violence and the relationship between maternal ACEs and child behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The percentages of mothers who had ever been exposed to ACEs and those with more than 3 ACEs were 66.3% and 18.6%, respectively. These rates were nearly in line with the rates reported in the first wave of the CDC-Kaiser ACE Study (64% and 25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the rates reported by the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) study conducted in the USA (61.5% and 24.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. </p><p id="Par45">On the other hand, studies from Arab countries revealed evidently higher rates of ever exposure as well as multiple exposures (&gt;&#8201;2) to ACEs among Tunisian university female students (72.2% and 27.7%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and adult Saudi women (80% and 55%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Differences between findings from Egypt and other Arab countries could be attributed to the cultural differences and community norms that accept violence as a positive family disciplinary practice, as well as methodological differences between studies, including sociodemographic characteristics of participants and assessment tools.</p><p id="Par46">The current findings indicated that the most frequently reported ACEs were mainly related to family violence, psychological abuse, witnessing domestic violence, and physical and sexual abuse, followed by household substance abuse. These findings were in agreement with studies from the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Tunisia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which pointed to emotional abuse/family violence as the most prevalent ACEs. Although there is partial agreement in the order of frequency of the different types of ACEs among different studies, the frequency of some types of ACEs varies according to the cultural background, prevailing social and parental practices and community norms of the study setting. This was evident in the findings of other studies that showed that the most common types were related to cultural practices not found in Egypt, such as living with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic reported in the 2 waves of the Kaiser Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], gender discrimination in Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and parental death in Lebanon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which was attributed to war conflicts.</p><p id="Par47">The present work provides further evidence that child abuse is a common parenting practice in successive generations in our community. Unfortunately, the offspring of the studied participants were not immune to childhood traumatic experiences. Psychological aggression was the most frequently reported type of child abuse perpetrated by sampled mothers, followed by corporal punishment, neglect, severe physical assault, and very severe physical assault. This order of frequency was comparable to the rates obtained from the Egypt UNICEF&#8217;s children survey in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the 2014 Egyptian demographic and health survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and a review of a series of meta-analyses on child abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. </p><p id="Par48">Indeed, the higher rates of child abuse perpetrated by the studied women compared to that experienced by them during their childhood years do not necessarily reflect an actual increase in the prevalence of child abuse in our community over time. Recall bias in general and selective recall of only severe and traumatic experiences as well as differences in assessment tools and informants might explain these differences.</p><p id="Par49">The findings of the current study revealed a statistically significant relationship between mothers&#8217; childhood experiences of physical, psychological, or sexual abuse, as well as witnessing domestic violence and perpetration of different forms of child abuse toward their children. This finding provides evidence of the intergenerational transmission of violence among the studied mothers. Further evidence for this relationship was revealed through logistic regression analysis, where ACEs related to violence were found to be significant predictors of physical and psychological child abuse perpetrated by mothers.</p><p id="Par50">Taken together, these findings support previous research evidence derived from studies from the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and KSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] as well as a meta-analysis by Madigan et al. on the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment, i.e., a parent&#8217;s history of maltreatment increases the risk of maltreatment among his/her children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. </p><p id="Par51">Furthermore, the findings of the current study unveiled the dose&#8210;response relationship between mothers&#8217; ACEs and different types of child abuse in their offspring. This was clear from the statistically significant positive correlation that was found between maternal exposure to ACEs and the severity of perpetration of child corporal punishment as well as between maternal psychological abuse and neglect.</p><p id="Par52">Similar findings were reported by Schofield et al. in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Bartlett et al. in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Moreover, type-specific transmission of child abuse was evident in mother&#8217;s ACE of psychological abuse that was a significant predictor of perpetration of the same type of abuse against her offspring, however this was not true for other types of abuse. In partial agreement, Sanchez and Berzenski et al. supported the evidence that the experience of a type of abuse was more likely to relate to that same type of abuse in the second generation than to other types; however, this was more pronounced in child physical abuse, which has commonly received wide interest from researchers than in other subtypes of child abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. </p><p id="Par53">Importantly, physical child abuse in the present study was found to be predicted by other ACEs related to family violence (gender discrimination and witnessing domestic violence) rather than by a frank ACE of physical abuse. Gender discrimination and spousal violence are common practices in our community that put the exposed child at risk of perpetrating child abuse in adulthood.</p><p id="Par54">The high rates of ACEs related to family violence among the studied women, as well as high rates of child abuse of women&#8217;s offspring, were compounded by the fact that approximately 1 in 3 women in the community are also victims of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, mothers&#8217; victimization by husbands emerged as an independent predictor of all forms of child physical abuse as well as child neglect. Taken together, these findings suggest that family violence is a common experience among women in our community.</p><p id="Par55">Evidence that children of young mothers are at increased risk of child maltreatment has been documented in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This can be explained by the complex social and mental challenges young mothers face, including poverty, poor social support, an unmarried mother and maternal mental health problems. In contrast, the findings of the current study indicated that all child maltreatment types and neglect were predicted by older age of the mothers (&#8805;&#8201;30 years old). These findings can be attributed to the fact that almost all participants in the current study, irrespective of their age, had some protective factors, such as being married and being aged older at the time of the study or at the time of childbirth, were older than 20 years of age. Nevertheless, older mothers were more likely to have a longer duration of marriage, a greater number of children (up to 6 children), which constitute a large financial burden on low-income families and a source of stress that drains on women&#8217;s psychological reserves to tolerate child challenging behaviours in conflicting situations.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par56">Although the current study provides valuable information concerning the relationship between ACEs and perpetration of child abuse among mothers, several limitations exist. First, the study population was predominantly urban and was not representative of the majority of the Egyptian mothers. The participants were also selected from the FHCs with the highest attendance rate, which might predispose the sample to selection bias, limiting the generalizability of the study findings. Second, unlike longitudinal designs, cross-sectional designs limit follow-up assessments of abuse perpetration and causal inference. Third, the assessment of ACEs relied upon mothers&#8217; reports of their childhood exposure, which might be associated with recall bias. Additionally, child abuse was evaluated based on mothers&#8217; reports, which are subject to response bias, and mothers might not frankly report such practices, leading to underreporting of abuse rates. Methodological limitations related to the current study sample, such as participants&#8217; sociodemographic characteristics and assessment tools, should be taken into consideration when comparing the current findings to those of other studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">The study findings indicated that ACEs, particularly those related to family violence, are prevalent among adult married women in our community. Collectively, the current study suggests that different forms of family violence, particularly child abuse and neglect and spousal violence, are strongly connected to each other in many important ways throughout different stages of women&#8217;s lives and across different generations. Indeed, time has come to address this complex problem through concerted national strategies across all levels and sectors, including health care, education, social affairs, mass media, and nongovernmental organizations. Multiple public health strategies and actions addressing violence and its determinants are recommended to target the problem at the national level. Educational strategies and awareness-raising actions through media campaigns are urgently needed to address the negative consequences of ACEs, the impact of violence on children and the promotion of nonviolent parenting skills and child discipline. The implementation of psychoeducational programmes for children and adolescents on how to manage and combat violence is ultimately important. In addition, identifying mothers and children exposed to abuse or violence and ensuring the provision of trauma-sensitive support services should be prioritized. Such services should include safe reporting mechanisms and psychological counselling. Further studies, including longitudinal studies and studies considering the child perspective, are recommended to expand our understanding of the interconnections among different forms of family violence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
