There has been increasing awareness of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (F-ILD) since 2018. Cottin et al. [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] firstly proposed the concept of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) who may develop a progressive-fibrosing phenotype in patients with ILDs. A complete statement of the concept was described in the study of INBUILD published in 2019 [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2020, George et al. proposed the suggested definition of PF-ILD in clinical practice to meet one of the following criteria: relative decline of &#8805;10&#160;% in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 24 months despite treatment; relative decline in FVC of &#8805;5&#160;% with decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of &#8805;15&#160;% over 24 months despite treatment; relative decline in FVC of &#8805;5&#160;% with increased fibrosis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) over 24 months despite treatment; relative decline in FVC of &#8805;5&#160;% with progressive symptoms over 24 months despite treatment; progressive symptoms along with increased fibrosis on HRCT over 24 months despite treatment [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on this, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) proposed the standard of progression of pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) in 2022 [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which was defined as at least two of three criteria (worsening symptoms, radiological progression, and physiological progression) occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation in a patient with an ILD other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</p><p id="p0015">As the phenotype of F-ILD is associated with worsening respiratory symptoms, lung function decline, limited response to immunomodulatory therapies, decreased quality of life and early death [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], early identification of F-ILD patients with high risk of progression will help to get early therapeutic intervention and potential improvement of outcomes. Research is needed to identify distinguishing clinical features that may predict which individuals are more likely to develop progressive fibrosis [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there is limited published research on the progression predictors of non-IPF F-ILD. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of disease progression of those with F-ILD beyond IPF from their demographic information, clinical features, imaging data and blood biomarkers being managed in a single center in China.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="p0020">Patients enrolled in the study required a follow-up of at least one year. We reviewed the data in July 2022, so the latest case to be selected was from July 2021. Moreover, in order to ensure a sufficient number of cases, cases were selected two and a half years ahead. Therefore, the screened cases included in this study were consecutive cases from January 2019 to July 2021. Consecutive patients diagnosed with ILD between January 1, 2019 and July 31, 2021&#160;at the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, and having complete lung function data available, were screened for this study, and the electronic medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. After excluding lung cancer, lung transplantation, tuberculosis and non-fibrotic ILD, the patients were divided into progressive group and non-progressive group according to the following criteria developed for the purposes of this project. Those who met at least one of the following criteria were defined as progressive group: an annual decline of more than 10&#160;% in FVC; an annual decline of more than 10&#160;% in DLCO; an increased extent of fibrosis on HRCT in one year, according to the previous studies [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">There were two researchers participated in the screening of cases. First, successive cases diagnosed with ILD were screened by XQC, then verified by Dr. YZ. The researchers selected successive cases and grouped them strictly according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, but were not blinded. At time of enrollment, information of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, course of disease, diagnosis, baseline pulmonary function (including FVC, FVC % predicted, DLCO % predicted), physiologic variables (GAP) stage [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], complete blood counts, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) estimated by echocardiography, and tumor markers in peripheral blood were recorded.</p><p id="p0030">XQC and QY were in charge of the objective data review in electronic medical record system, who were both independent to the clinical management of the patients.

All disagreements were resolved through consensus. The HRCT scans were classified as showing an usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern or not [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], having the presence of emphysema or not, and showing tractive bronchiectasis or not.

Combined the standards of PF-ILD [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and PPF [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and in order to minimize the influence of subjective factors and ensure the reliability of a retrospective study, we put forward the inclusion criteria in this study as mentioned minutely in methods.</p><p id="p0075">A total of 354 patients with ILD were screened in this study, and 177 patients with F-ILD were retrospectively reviewed. The category included CTD-ILD, IPF, IPAF, unclassifiable ILD, sarcoidosis, HP, NSIP, COP, PAP, CPFE, and pneumoconiosis. Statistical analysis showed that in addition to the well-known IPF subgroup, NSIP and HP were also the subgroups most prone to disease progression, consistent with the previous report carried out in the United States [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">After adjusting for gender and age, a course of disease longer than 9.5 months, lymphocyte in peripheral blood more than 2.24 (10^9/L), and emphysema in HRCT were found three independent predictors of progression in F-ILD patients. It shows that when the disease course of a F-ILD patient exceeds 9.5 months, it is necessary to pay more attention to the disease situation and adjust the treatment as appropriate. Current study results are somewhat different from previous studies. Andrew et al. and Mikolasch et al. both reported that neutrophil lymphocyte ratio was an indicator for disease progression in IPF patients (HR 1.3; 95%CI 1.16&#8211;1.48; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.00002 and HR 2.04, 95&#160;% CI 1.09&#8211;3.81, n&#160;=&#160;71, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.025) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and also reported in Nathan et al.&#8217; s study [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the above studies were all carried out in cohort of IPF patients, not all F-ILD patients. In another study, it was reported that only increased blood monocyte level was a risk factor for radiological progression in patients with early fibrotic interstitial lung abnormality (HR 1.79, 95&#160;% CI 1.05&#8211;2.86; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.030) [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, a significant difference was not found in either neutrophil lymphocyte ratio or monocyte in this present study. These findings showing associations between certain WBC and IPF outcomes suggest a systemic inflammatory state. Neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes have all been linked with the pathogenesis of IPF. However, the relationship between local and systemic inflammation may not always be clear, and the mechanism by which systemic inflammation may arise and how this might reflect disease progression in patients with IPF or F-ILD are not yet well understood [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">Previous studies have reported that compared with patients with IPF alone, patients with CPFE were reported to have worse survival [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. It suggests that the phenotype of emphysema may be a predictor of poorer prognosis. However, most of these studies were aimed at IPF, there are also some different opinions about emphysema worldwide [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. There's not much research on all types of patients with F-ILD in a large cohort. This present study is one of the rare studies to conduct a statistical analysis of all types of F-ILD including IPF, and first proposed that the elevation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and the emphysema phenotype on HRCT were closely related to disease progression, which may be further verified in a larger cohort and more research centers in the future. Meanwhile, it was found in this present study that when the three conditions are met at the same time, the ROC for predicting disease progression reached at 0.682. Particularly, the three indicators could be easily and quickly obtained from inpatient or outpatient. It could have certain guiding significance for the management of patients with F-ILD and the timing of anti-fibrosis treatment.</p><p id="p0090">Several limitations associated with retrospective and monocentric design in this study. It was a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, which may cause some biases. Authors plan to further expand the cohort and set up a validation cohort to verify findings. Secondly, due to the absence of lung function data, not all consecutive cases patients with F-ILD were included in the study, which may have some influence on the results. Thirdly, some patients with unclassifiable type of F-ILD, due to the low percentage of surgical biopsies, may have resulted in an imprecise classification.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0095">In conclusion, this study demonstrates that long course of disease, elevated blood lymphocyte and emphysema on HRCT were promising predictors of progression in patients with F-ILD.
