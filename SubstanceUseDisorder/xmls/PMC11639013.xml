</bold>.</p><p>Most people with substance use disorders (SUDs) receive no treatment. In the USA, two smartphone app-based digital treatments for SUD and opioid use disorders (OUDs) became available by prescription. The Digital Treatments for Substance Use Disorder (DIGITS) study, a randomized implementation trial, tested how best to integrate these digital treatments for SUD and OUD into primary care. Throughout the study, we conducted a formative evaluation to observe progress, recommend implementation improvements, and understand how digital treatments could be offered to patients after the study ended. For this evaluation, we collected qualitative data through observing study meetings and interviewing primary care leaders, clinicians, and clinical and study staff. The data were regularly summarized and reported to our clinical partners and the study team. We used two implementation frameworks to interpret the data: the Dynamic Sustainability Framework and the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-based Implementation Strategies. The evaluation revealed factors that helped and hindered implementation. Obstacles from outside the health care system included the COVID-19 pandemic, laws, regulations, and delays in setting up contractual agreements, whereas a partnership with the digital treatment vendor proved helpful. Clinics had difficulties with clinician burden, staff shortages, lack of time and available appointments, and performing new and unfamiliar tasks. The electronic health record system both supported and impended implementation. Last, few patients accepted the offered digital treatment, or used it persistently. Formative evaluation results suggest that digital treatments for SUD and OUD in primary care are promising, however their successful use requires supportive laws and regulations, health system resources, and increased patient and clinician engagement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>substance use disorder</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>implementation science</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>formative evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-26334895241301670"><funding-source id="funding1-26334895241301670"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-26334895241301670">R01DA047954</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-26334895241301670"><funding-source id="funding2-26334895241301670"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-26334895241301670">K01AA023859</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-26334895241301670"><title>Background</title><p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) result in individual and societal burden, but only 36% of people with past-year opioid use disorder (OUD) receive treatment and as few as 22% receive first-line medication (e.g., buprenorphine) (<xref rid="bibr11-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt &amp; Hall, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">SAMHSA, 2023</xref>).

The research team and mental health leadership facilitated regional changes to institute a standing order policy allowing LICSWs to immediately provision PDTs based on standard eligibility criteria, later obtaining a physician prescriber's approval and signature. The EHR allowed standing order implementation but required that clinicians execute new steps with multiple clicks to complete prescriptions.

PDT eligibility criteria precluded use for some with common treatment needs, contributing to poor uptake.</p><p>Skillful practice facilitation and health coaching augmented standard implementation strategies, assisting clinicians with workflow concerns. However, many multilevel barriers were outside strategy scope such as low clinic capacity and staffing losses, or workflow hurdles from the lack of EHR-PDT communication. Health coaching to assist patients and minimize clinician burden was hampered by inability to reach patients. The intervention and implementation strategies could not mitigate health or psychosocial conditions beyond SUDs.</p><p>A DIGITS goal was gaining insights for future PDT implementation. Our formative evaluation generated lessons and recommendations to improve implementing digital therapeutics in clinical care. First, PDTs versus non-prescription health and wellness apps promise unique benefits but with unique legal and regulatory challenges. This increases administrative tasks for implementors, healthcare administrators, and organizational leaders. The PDT prescription process clashed with clinicians&#8217; scope of practice, leading to implementation delays as the research team and clinical leaders spurred institution of new health system policies. Research and implementation teams should know of these issues before selecting PDTs to implement, and thoroughly investigate organizational rules and federal and state laws pertaining to novel intervention features (e.g., monetary incentives). Maintaining connections and good working relationships with clinical leaders and organizational compliance and security officials was critically important to addressing obstacles.</p><p>Another lesson is that EHR limitations compound workflow issues. Limited vendor-EHR integration made it burdensome for clinicians to perform reSET and reSET-O implementation tasks, especially when outside their usual role, as supported by prior research (<xref rid="bibr34-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Quanbeck et al., 2018</xref>). Health system's information technologists refused to integrate the PDT into the EHR without evidence that the intervention would be sustained, creating a &#8220;chicken-and-egg&#8221; workflow limitation that reduced sustainment likelihood. We iteratively co-designed new workflows with the implementers, considering their needs and preferences, and identifying barriers promptly. Pilot clinicians acknowledged that EHR integration would be beneficial but did not see lack of integration as a major limitation, although our evaluation found it a significant implementation impediment. We recommend involving a broader group of clinicians in piloting, especially those less receptive to technology, to identify constraints before implementation. Benefits of co-design with patients, clinicians, and end-users are documented (<xref rid="bibr39-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Slattery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Marketing digital therapeutics interventions to clinicians and leaders is essential. We prepared dissemination materials and invited LICSWs to share patient success stories with peers (<xref rid="bibr33-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Parchman et al., 2022</xref>) and clinical partners held a medical education session about reSET and reSET-O. This worked in some cases (e.g., with clinicians using our huddle cards). However, a more comprehensive, coordinated communication strategy led by health system leadership may be necessary with novel interventions with multilevel adoption barriers (<xref rid="bibr1-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Aarons et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Relationship building was critical to overcoming implementation obstacles and maintaining partnerships. We forged relationships with informational technologists and delivery system and clinical leaders before DIGITS, maintaining and expanding them to foster frontline managers&#8217; engagement. During unavoidable organizational change, involvement of clinical implementation partners from study design to interpreting results will support long-standing and new connections. These efforts are an important investment to ensuring progress and results under difficult circumstances. Ongoing engagement, maintaining relationships, and fostering trust are crucial for implementation (<xref rid="bibr19-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Horton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Rose &amp; Schlichter, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Sustainment of PDTs ended when the vendor declared bankruptcy and discontinued the apps. Nonetheless, digital interventions continue their promise to address health behaviors and improve patient access and treatment for SUDs and other diseases (<xref rid="bibr3-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Abernethy et al., 2022</xref>), although widespread adoption and reach may require contingency planning for sustainability and continuity as digital healthcare grows and evolves. Lessons from DIGITS provide implementation guidance for SUD digital therapeutics and emerging best practices for integrating new interventions into healthcare.</p><p>Strengths of our formative evaluation included rigorous, flexible, data collection and analysis to adjust to project and delivery system needs. Multiple data sources and regular member checking validated findings. Limitations included absence of direct patient contact. Patient PDT experiences were from clinicians and the health coach. We did not collect standardized measures of implementation constructs from clinicians (<xref rid="bibr9-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Clinton-McHarg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-26334895241301670" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). The COVID-19 pandemic limited our observations; therefore, we did not directly observe clinics randomized to standard implementation alone and had less information on clinics with health coaching without practice facilitation. We learned about experiences at these clinics through interactions with clinicians during training and department meetings. Vendor bankruptcy precluded identifying facilitators and barriers to sustainment.</p></sec><sec id="section5-26334895241301670"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DIGITS formative evaluation offers a unique, close-up look into implementing PDTs for SUD and OUD in primary care.
