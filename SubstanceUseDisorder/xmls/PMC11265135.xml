Furthermore, patient-directed discharge is a marked negative outcome for patients with OUD who are hospitalized, particularly for individuals who inject drugs.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A large study evaluating admissions at 362 US hospitals found that administering MOUD in the hospital was associated with a lower risk of patient-directed discharge, yet it was used only 22% of the time for admitted patients with OUD.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The outcomes of starting MOUD following a hospital visit have largely focused on rate of either outpatient follow-up or readmission. For patients not previously receiving MOUD, the association between initiating MOUD following a hospital visit (either ED visit or admission) and a future overdose has gone largely understudied. The aim of this study, therefore, was to address this gap by leveraging a comprehensive linked public health dataset in Oregon that includes ED visits and hospital admissions, prescription drug monitoring program medication dispensations, medication-related billing data, and vital statistics records to assess whether patients diagnosed with OUD who started MOUD after a hospital visit (for reasons other than overdose) had lower adjusted odds for fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose at 6 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-ZOI240751"><title>Methods</title><p>The Mass General Brigham Human Research Committee approved this cohort study, and patient consent requirement was waived because this study posed minimal risk to participants and the research could not practically be conducted without the waiver.

The foundational data source for the database is the voluntary Oregon All Payer Claims Database (APCD), which includes Medicaid, Medicare (traditional and Medicare Advantage), and commercial insurance claims for approximately 80% of Oregonians from 2013 to 2020. The APCD was probabilistically linked using first name, last name, and date of birth, with a threshold of 85%, to the Oregon prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), Oregon vital records death certificates, emergency medical services, and the Oregon hospital discharge database. Discharges from the ED were ascertained from APCD data.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H2-2-ZOI240751"><title>Study Sample</title><p>For the index visit, we identified patients with diagnosis codes related to OUD (<italic toggle="yes">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]</italic> codes F11.1x-F11.2x and F11.9x) that were recorded at an ED visit or hospitalization from January 2017 to December 2019. We did not specifically evaluate medical diagnosis codes associated with drug use, such as endocarditis, as inclusion criteria, but they could have been present alongside the included codes. We also excluded patients with overdose (poisoning) codes at their index visit, as the intended study population was patients with OUD who had a reason for medical care apart from overdose. When a hospitalization resulted from an ED visit, it was considered a hospitalization and only the final diagnosis codes from the hospitalization were considered. Although we had data on visits predating 2017, we did not include them given the shifting illicit opioid supply that has been more recently dominated by synthetic fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. We included patients aged 18 years or older. Race and ethnicity were not included due to substantial missingness in the data. To ensure capture of all relevant outcomes, we restricted the sample to patients who had continuous insurance enrollment 6 months before and 12 months after the index hospital visit but allowed up to a 60-day gap in coverage. To avoid correlated records, we included only each patient&#8217;s first episode in our study period and, thus, excluded individuals with an OUD-related hospitalization or ED visit in the prior 6 months. To assure that we only included patients starting MOUD, we also excluded individuals with evidence of MOUD receipt (either a billing code for clinic-administered buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone or a PDMP record of a dispensation of an OUD formulation for buprenorphine) in the previous 6 months (eAppendix 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI240751-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-ZOI240751"><title>Covariates</title><p>We categorized age in groups as of January 1, 2017 (18-24, 25-39, 40-54, 55-74, and &#8805;75 years).

We also searched the literal text fields of the death record for terms associated with opioid and heroin overdose.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Outcomes were also stratified by MOUD type and location of care (ED visit only vs hospitalization).</p></sec><sec id="H2-6-ZOI240751"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We generated frequency distributions of the sample characteristics, including age, sex, insurance plan, comorbidities, and the opioid-related overdose events, stratified by receipt or nonreceipt of MOUD treatment 7 days after an OUD-related visit discharge. We then used a logistic regression model to investigate the association between receipt of MOUD during that time and having an opioid overdose event within the study&#8217;s 6- or 12-month follow-up period. We chose a logistic regression model instead of a Cox proportional hazards regression model because of the qualitative nature of the outcome (an overdose). Our intent was to identify factors associated in any way with outcomes but not factors associated with a later occurrence in the follow-up period. In addition, a logistic regression model does not rely on a proportion hazards assumption. Following our main analysis, we studied patients who received MOUD after an ED visit and then separately those discharged after hospitalization.

We also found that rates varied depending on patient population, with 10.6% of patients aged 18 to 24 years and only 1.8% of those aged 55 to 74 years receiving treatment. These findings are concerning given that OUD and overdose still occur in older populations.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Medicaid patients had the highest rate of treatment receipt (9.1%), but only 1.8% of dually enrolled patients and 0.9% of Medicare patients received treatment. The findings suggest that more interventions are needed to address the broad range of system-level gaps that influence low MOUD prescribing rates in hospitals.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The rate of overdose in the patient population in this study was also of interest. In prior work, 5.5% of ED patients discharged after an overdose died within 12 months.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the present cohort, only 0.3% of patients had a fatal overdose within 12 months, suggesting that this population may be at less risk than those discharged from an ED after overdose. The former study<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> occurred in Massachusetts (as opposed to Oregon), and patterns of drug use may differ. Also, the current study captured individuals who had OUD but presented for health care for reasons other than overdose, while the Massachusetts study examined overdose discharges.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Still, the current cohort had a 3.4% risk of fatal or nonfatal overdose at 12 months, which is notable and merits more attention, especially as rates of death are increasing with more synthetic fentanyl analogues in the nonmedical opioid supply.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Although the AOR of fatal or nonfatal overdose was lower overall with receipt of MOUD at 6 months, there were also lower odds of fatal or nonfatal overdose at 6 months specifically among patients receiving MOUD after an ED visit, further supporting guidelines that recommend commencing MOUD from the ED setting.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Although MOUD initiation was associated with lower odds of overdose at 6 months, there was no association at 12 months. It is unknown whether this finding is because of the small sample size or a lack of treatment effects. We only evaluated whether MOUD was obtained immediately after hospitalization, but patients were not followed up longitudinally to assess whether they continued receiving MOUD. Retention in treatment is a significant factor associated with decreased mortality,<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and further research will need to determine which factors contribute to patients continuing treatment after it is begun in the hospital setting. In, to our knowledge, the first large study of buprenorphine initiation in EDs, there was increased retention in treatment at 30 days, but the associated increase dissipated after 6 months,<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> emphasizing the need for overarching improvements to the OUD care system to make it more patient-centered and accessible.</p><p>Buprenorphine use was associated with lower odds of overdose at 6 months, but methadone was not. As with the finding at 12 months, this lack of association could be related to a small number of outcomes. However, it may also represent less effectiveness of methadone started in the hospital setting. Although outcomes associated with methadone and buprenorphine are similar,<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> there are multiple complexities related to starting methadone in the hospital, including the need to establish linkage to an outpatient treatment program that dispenses methadone. These challenges are not insurmountable, and there is a framework for hospitals to guide implementation.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Different than methadone, buprenorphine can be prescribed and dispensed at commercial pharmacies, although access varies. The recent abolishment of the buprenorphine X-waiver may encourage more prescribers to provide this medication to their patients, but barriers at pharmacies remain.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>The current study examined specifically patient-level factors (ie, age, sex, and number of comorbidities), but we were unable to determine the characteristics of the hospitals in which individuals were treated. Medication is only one consideration; hospitals that use other techniques, such as bridge clinics to facilitate ongoing outpatient treatment, substance navigators and/or peer recovery coaches, and dedicated addiction consultation teams, may have more success linking patients to ongoing treatment and encouraging patients to start MOUD.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240751r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> There may also be reasons why patients do not want to start MOUD even when it is recommended, such as fear of precipitated withdrawal from buprenorphine<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>; recent opioid use, which would preclude naltrexone use; or when the patient is not yet ready for OUD treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi240751r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-7-ZOI240751"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this study to consider. Primarily, this was a retrospective observational study that relied on administrative billing code data that captured hospital visits, medication dispensation, and outcomes in a single state. The Oregon APCD captures information on approximately 80% of the population, but 1 in 5 is not included. To determine outcomes, we required continuous enrollment with a maximum 60-day gap. In so doing, we likely excluded the most vulnerable patients who either did not have insurance or discontinued insurance during the study period. We considered certain basic patient characteristics but could not include others that may be important, such as location of residence (particularly rural vs urban, which can impact access to MOUD treatment), reason for hospital visit, or primary substance used (eg, prescribed opioids, heroin, or fentanyl). Although we attempted to consider severity of illness by including number of Elixhauser comorbidities, it is possible that only healthier patients, those who expressed interest in MOUD and motivation for recovery, or those who had another characteristic not available in our data received the treatment, which is a threat to validity. We were not able to ascertain individual comorbid conditions from our data. We could also not ascertain the readiness of patients for MOUD treatment, including whether it was offered but declined. We also did not determine the dosage of the MOUD given, whether treatment continued beyond the first 7 days, or whether the prescription was generated during or after the hospital visit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI240751"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this cohort study suggest that initiation of MOUD after hospital visits is associated with reduced odds of opioid-related overdose at 6 months. Hospitals and their associated EDs should consider implementing programs and protocols to offer initiation of MOUD to patients with OUD who present for care.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI240751"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi240751r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
