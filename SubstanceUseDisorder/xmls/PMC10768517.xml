<bold>Core Tip:</bold> Evidence suggests that diabetic patients who have experienced homelessness are at higher risk of being diagnosed with mental illness, and that social support services are impactful in the management of the comorbidity of diabetes and mental health problems. Studies on the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) among patients with diabetes are limited. Available studies have shown that CTI is a promising intervention for alleviating mental health symptoms in homeless patients.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diabetes can cause other health problems and complications, both physically and psychologically. Diabetes is a chronic disorder of metabolism that has become a major health concern worldwide. It is characterized by absolute deficits in insulin secretion; chronic hyperglycemia; and abnormal carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Glucose levels in the blood are elevated in people with diabetes[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the literature, diabetes has been classified into four types: Type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), gestational diabetes (GD), and other diabetes associated with certain specific conditions such as pathologies or disorder[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TID is insulin-dependent diabetes, which constitutes 5%-10% of all diabetic cases. T1D is an autoimmune disorder distinguished by T cell-mediated degeneration of pancreatic &#946; cells, ultimately resulting in insulin depletion and hyperglycemia[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The pathogenesis of T1D is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the pancreatic &#946; cell-specific autoimmunity development rate is rapid in infants and children. T2D is non-insulin-dependent diabetes that constitutes about 90%&#8211;95% of diabetes cases. The characteristics of T2D are abnormalities in insulin secretion, &#946; cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. T2D is often undiagnosed because it progresses very slowly asymptomatically over the years until the appearance of classic symptoms connected with severe hyperglycemia such as weight loss, growth impairment, polyuria, and polydipsia at the advanced stage. The pathogenesis of T2D is complex and involves multiple unknown and known features such as a combination of genetic predisposition and strong environmental influences. T2D is prevalent in older adults and is linked to obesity, inactivity, adoption of modern lifestyles, and a family history of diabetes[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. GD is a type of diabetes linked to pregnancy, which is diagnosed between the second and third trimesters excluding undetected T2D. GD is characterized by an increase in blood glucose levels in the third trimester of pregnancy. Ninety percent of diabetes and its complications in such a period are attributed to GD, with a prevalence varying from 1% to 14%[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The risk of GD is linked to older age, previous pregnancy with a large baby, obesity, and a history of impaired glucose tolerance and is associated with a high lifetime risk of developing T2D[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other types of diabetes associated with peculiar conditions such as pathologies or many disorders are those stemming from monogenic defects in &#946; cell function, genetic abnormalities in insulin action, and exocrine pancreatic pathologies, among other conditions[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Diabetic patients may feel insecure in terms of their mental health. As a result, they monitor their blood glucose excessively, worry about complications, and constantly monitor their personal and work lives. When diabetes and mental illness coexist, the prognosis is often poor[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Complex interventions are often required for chronic and comorbid illnesses. Medications are in most cases less effective at treating all facets of diabetes and mental illness together[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As a chronic disease, it can impair daily function and mobility, which are more prevalent in homeless people than in homeowners[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Having diabetes can be physically and emotionally difficult, both for those with the disease and their families. As a result, people living with it must manage the disease continuously.</p><p>There are a number of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, which can affect diabetic patients. Diabetes has been linked to mental health complications such as psychotic disorders and complications distinctive to diabetic patients[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A number of terms were also utilized to describe the mental health problems connected with diabetes. For example, &#8220;diabetes distress&#8221; describes the negative emotions experienced by people with diabetes, as well as the burden of managing it, which explains the feelings of despair and emotional turmoil that are specifically related to diabetes, particularly the need for continued monitoring and care, ongoing concerns regarding complications, and the potential for professional and personal relationships to be eroded[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A condition known as psychological insulin resistance is characterized by an unwillingness to accept insulin therapy, leading to a delay in starting treatment[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Knowledge of the relationship between diabetes and mental health is crucial in that psychiatric and diabetes-specific psychosocial problems are associated with diminished participation in self-management activities that can decrease the quality of life and care for victims and their families. Complications related to diabetes and mortality in the early stages are associated with psychiatric disorders in diabetic patients[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, individuals with T1D or T2D are at increased risk of these conditions[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, depression rates across the lifespan are twice as high for diabetics as for the general population. It was predicted that diabetic patients have poorer mental health generally, and in a variety of mental health dimensions in particular[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, studies in the past have shown that diabetes is linked to severe depressive disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], schizophrenia[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], personality disorders[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], stress, trauma, abuse and neglect[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and sleep issues[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and mental health conditions, non-pharmacological interventions such as critical time intervention (CTI) can be used.</p><p>CTI is an intervention program that is time-limited and designed to decrease the adverse effects associated with homelessness and other risky outcomes by providing assistance to individuals in their critical transitional time[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CTI is characterized by concentrated case management that lasts for 6 to 9 mo and is geared towards assisting mental health patients navigate the severe service system and create contact with long-term community-based links, resources, and interventions[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CTI may benefit adults with diabetes and mental health challenges. As a result, comorbid diabetes and mental health conditions make maintaining lifestyle changes more difficult. As a result, this group has more difficulty recognizing and discussing their health concerns, and engaging with services to manage their health[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Homelessness and inadequate care may also be challenges they face. Although CTI has received a lot of attention as a way of managing mental health conditions, little is known about its effectiveness in managing and treating coexistent diabetes and mental health conditions. CTI is an evidence-based practice designed to mobilize support for society's most disadvantaged individuals in times of transition[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This promotes greater integration into the community and ensures a continuous flow of care by allowing people to remain connected to their communities and social support networks during these difficult times. CTI is also a type of time-limited, intensive case management model of treatment, which helps maintain continuity of care for service users while they are in transition such as from a shelter to a private residence after discharge[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a result of this intervention, a person&#8217;s network of support within the community is strengthened[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In addition to reducing the risk of homelessness after institutional discharge, CTI strives to enhance the quality of life for individuals and families. It also provides time-limited direct support in terms of emotional and practical assistance during the period of transition by reinforcing the consumer&#8217;s long-term ties to formal services, family, and friends[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among the key features of CTI is the provision of post-discharge assistance by workers who have maintained close contact with clients before discharge[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Aside from providing emotional and practical assistance during critical transition periods, CTI also offers case management services to enhance the relationship between an individual and their family, friends, and services[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There are three stages of CTI[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: (1) Providing direct assistance to the client and assessing the resources available to support the client; (2) evaluating and adjusting the support systems as necessary; and (3) ensuring that existing community resources are transferred to the client. A variety of groups have benefited from CTI, including veterans, individual with psychiatric disorders, those who have been incarcerated, and people with diabetes. After being discharged from hospitals, shelters, prisons, and other institutions, individuals with mental illness may become homeless. The foundation of CTI rests on elements found in other evidence-based models such as small caseloads, active community outreach, individual case management plans, psychosocial skill building, and motivational coaching are key elements[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Notwithstanding the substantial role of CTI in the management of mental health problems in patients with other health problems, there is a lacuna with respect to documented empirical evidence of the effectiveness of CTI in enhancing the mental health of diabetic patients. Therefore, conducting a scoping literature review to establish the scope and depth of empirical research on the effectiveness of CTI in improving the mental health of patients with diabetes is necessary due to the prevalence of diabetes worldwide. Taking this study into account, public health practitioners will be able to determine the extent of CTI&#8217;s effectiveness in improving the mental wellbeing of diabetics. Furthermore, psychologists or therapists will find this study useful since it will expose the existing gaps regarding CTI in treating the mental health of diabetic patients.</p><p>Therefore, the major aim of this study was to establish the current significance of fostering the mental health of patients with diabetes through CTI by conducting a scoping review of the available empirical studies.</p><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>The following questions were addressed by this review:</p><p>What are the mental health challenges associated with homeless diabetic patients?</p><p>What is the impact of CTI in enhancing the mental health of homeless individuals during the time of transition?</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Based on a scoping review of existing research studies, the current study examined the significance of fostering the mental health of diabetic patients through CTI.

<bold>Screening:</bold> After the database search was completed, the results were exported into Zotero and duplicates were removed. To evaluate all retrieved citations, the authors used a cloud-based systematic review management portal (rayyan.ai). Next, titles were screened to exclude irrelevant publications, opinion papers, and reviews. Then all titles and abstracts of papers were screened by two reviewers using stipulated inclusion and exclusion criteria. To extract and synthesize data, all citations eligible for full-text review were examined using the same methodology. We kept articles with uncertain eligibility status for further review during the assessment process. Finally, the abstracts were read to determine whether the study's aim met the scoping review question.</p><p>
<bold>Selection:</bold> The full-text articles were read to confirm each study's eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third reviewer assisted the first two reviewers in resolving potential conflicts about eligibility through discussion after all articles selected after screening were independently reviewed. Data extraction was completed after discrepancies were resolved and papers meeting standards for inclusion were selected.</p><p>
<bold>Data extraction process:</bold> In the extraction phase, the data were independently extracted from articles according to the theme, purposes, and questions of the present scoping review. Relevant information from all included papers were extracted using a pre-designed data extraction form that included items on study characteristics [<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, author and year of study, location, population and year of the study, study objective, type of mental health disorder, participants&#8217; characteristics (age of participants and sex among others), method and sample, intervention description and findings].

Regarding the mental health challenges associated with homeless diabetic patients, this study revealed that diabetic patients with a history of homelessness are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness such as self-management disorder, low perception, depression, substance abuse, cognitive disability, psychotic disorder, and bipolar disorder. The comorbidity of diabetics and mental health problems of homeless patients are associated with higher hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c). However, taking medication with increased support and supervision in a shelter for patients with mental illness substantially reduces the HBA1c[<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>This review also found that social support services are impactful in the management of comorbidity of diabetes and mental health problems. Such social supports that enhances the mental health of diabetic patients are affordable house rent and rental assistance, which reduce diabetic patients&#8217; expenditure with respect to rent and increases their financial muscle to offset their diabetes-related expenses[<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, a study identified that provision of in-shelter care, peer outreach and support, diabetes specialty outreach clinics, diabetes group care specific for this population, and community-based pharmacy interventions are impactful in the management of the mental health of homeless diabetic patients[<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Group medical visits to the shelter of homeless diabetic patients have been found to be impactful and therapeutic[<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is attributed to its tendency to improve individual patient&#8217;s perception of diabetes management, emotional support, accountability, and social competition. This means that medical visits give patients hope and make them feel a part of society. Therefore, social support services are an integral and impactful mechanism of managing the mental health of diabetic patients, as diabetes management with an enriched support system facilitates patient recovery from diabetes symptoms such as a reduction in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels.</p><p>This review reveals that CTI is impactful in enhancing the mental health of homeless patients during the transitional period from the hospital through social support and interventions to ensure that their needs are met and delivered in a timely manner as well as engagement of these homeless patients. However, the effectiveness of CTI has not been tested in homeless diabetic patients. This means that there is a lacuna in the use of CTI to enhance the mental health of patients with diabetes, especially homeless individuals transitioning from the hospital. However, the literature has shown that the effectiveness of CTI has been established in homeless individuals with mental health problems. A study revealed that CTI enhanced participants&#8217; engagement in continuity with care and improved access to service[<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Access to service is one focus of CTI, especially for homeless patients during the transition process. CTI is a robust intervention for promoting social support in individuals experiencing psychological distress who have less social support[<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; it promotes the fulfillment of unmet needs and lessens the symptoms of post-traumatic stress symptoms among abused women[<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, CTI is also helpful in transitioning prisoners with mental illness because clients who receive CTI intervention are less anxious about their release and reportedly receive more support for housing, access to services, and community reintegration than their counterparts[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CTI also reportedly facilitates their access to medication[<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], lowering psychiatric rehospitalization rates and preventing the recurrence of homelessness[<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The reviewed studies revealed that CTI is impactful in managing individuals with a history of chronic homelessness and co-occurring disorders through a decrease in alcohol use, drugs, and psychiatric symptoms[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], possibly due to the fact that they are known to suffer from a higher frequency of diabetes-related adverse consequences. A number of factors contribute to this disparity including inadequate access to medical care, inability to pay for medications and supplies, dissatisfaction with healthcare providers, and conflicting priorities.</p><p>Moreover, one of the major contributors to the disparities in outcomes is likely related to the fact that diabetes treatments are often not tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of people who are homeless. According to the reviews, no studies have specifically examined the impact of CTI on the mental health of diabetic patients. This indicates that there is a gap in the literature concerning CTI for fostering diabetic patients' mental health. Therefore, more studies are needed to truly understand CTI&#8217;s impact on the mental health of diabetic patients.</p><p>This review identified two key findings regarding CTI's effectiveness in managing the mental health of homeless patients. First, CTI improves housing outcomes and service engagement use outcomes for homeless people with diabetes-related ailments and their mental health conditions. Results like these coincide with CTI&#8217;s focus of connecting individuals with community services and support to address critical transition needs. It is clear from these findings that the CTI model is practical and adaptable in that it can be successfully implemented in a variety of settings and populations[<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This assertion was demonstrated in the study by Davachi and Ferrari[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which used a survey research design to conduct a 12-mo intervention study to develop a diabetes management support program for homeless people, especially those at risk or already diagnosed with the disease. According to the study by Davachi and Ferrari[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], social service support, which is part of CTI, is effective for managing the mental health of people with pre-existing diabetes. A cohort study conducted by Wiens <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] between 2006 and 2019 in Ontario, Toronto in Canada further supports the above assertion. According to the study, 5219 diabetic people with documented homelessness (75%) found suitable matches. An important demographic and clinical characteristic of diabetic people was also balanced within a derived matched cohort. Second, CTI has been shown to be supportive and therapeutic in managing diabetic patients' mental health. This is substantiated by the studies of Shaw <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], de Vet <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], Kasprow and Rosenheck[<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and Shinn <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] whose findings proved that CTI is effective in enhancing the mental health of homeless individuals. CTI may improve individuals' perception of diabetes management through problem solving, modeling, information and education, emotional support, accountability, and social competition.</p><sec><title>Implications of findings and recommendations</title><p>This study revealed that diabetic patients with a history of homelessness are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness, and social support services are impactful for the management of comorbidity of diabetes and mental health problems. This indicates that the mental health disorder of homeless diabetic patients could be attributed to the adverse effects of their environment, which predispose them to substance abuse that increases their mental disorder. Therefore, an intervention such as CTI, which focuses on enhancing the mental health of homeless diabetic patients, is required to facilitate and manage their smooth transition and ensure that they have access to support services that facilitate their integration into society. This study supports existing research demonstrating that CTI is highly effective, supportive, and therapeutic for managing the mental health of patients, especially those who are homeless or have a history of homelessness. As a result, most homeless patients' mental health disorders are managed using either or both of these interventions and ultimately are successful in overcoming their challenges. Therefore, healthcare professionals are well positioned to identify homeless patients and work with them to reduce their individual barriers to diabetes care; however, organizations must ensure that patients are connected to the larger health care system and facilitate low barriers to accessing diabetes care. This review found limited evidence addressing how CTI achieves its positive effects. Exactly how CTI reduces the mental health conditions of diabetic patients with homelessness and other outcomes is unknown. Consequently, this lays the groundwork for future studies investigating CTI's impact on diabetic mental health. Further research is clearly needed to determine whether and how CTI's program components affect specific outcomes and to map these components onto specific mediators.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the review</title><p>Due to the unavailability of studies that specifically dealt with the impact of CTI on homeless diabetic patients, this review revolved around the mental health challenges associated with homeless diabetic patients and the impact of CTI in enhancing the mental health of homeless individuals during the time of transition. Second, the included studies used a variety of populations and settings, resulting in a difficult comparison across them. Accordingly, we did not assess methodological quality or bias risk in accordance with the adhering guidelines. Furthermore, the study did not examine the cost of CTI or examine other kinds of case management interventions that could be used in treating diabetic patients&#8217; mental health, instead focusing solely on CTI. Therefore, future reviews should consider all kinds of case management interventions that may be used. Furthermore, we retrieved literature from leading databases to include peer-reviewed articles, while unpublished studies from unselected databases were not included. Last but not least, including only English-language articles may have resulted in a loss of evidence regarding the effectiveness of CTI for diabetic mental health.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This review has shown that homeless diabetic patients are frequently diagnosed with several mental health problems, which require an intervention program such as CTI for enhancing their mental health. The available literature reviewed for this research shows that there is no specific CTI study that focused on managing the mental health of diabetic patients. This indicates that it has not been given adequate attention by researchers. In light of this, more empirical studies should be conducted across the globe, using both participants in hospitals as well as community-based settings to determine the effectiveness of CTI in managing mental health of diabetic patients more effectively and clearly.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><sec><title>Research background</title><p>Critical time intervention (CTI) is an evidence-based model of practice that is time-limited and aims to provide support for most susceptible individuals during a transition period.</p></sec><sec><title>Research motivation</title><p>Diabetes can cause other health problems and complications, both physically and psychologically.
