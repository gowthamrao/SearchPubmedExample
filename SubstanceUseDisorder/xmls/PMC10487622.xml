However, this process can also cause tissue damage to the host. Neutrophils contain high concentrations of vitamin C (1.5 mM) compared to the bloodstream (0.1 mM), and this antioxidant can interact with vitamin E and glutathione (GSH) inside the cell to maintain the redox balance. Previous studies have investigated the effect of vitamins E or C and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on NET formation, but the interactions of these molecules in neutrophils remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of antioxidants alone and two combinations on NET formation and oxidative stress. Neutrophils were pre-loaded with GSH + NAC or vitamin E + vitamin C + GSH + NAC (termed ALL), and LPS-induced NET formation was assessed using fluorometry and immunofluorescence. Antioxidant effects were evaluated by measuring the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), GSH/GSSG ratio, ROS production, nitrite + nitrate levels, and lipid peroxidation. Our results showed that even low doses of antioxidants are capable of decreasing NETs. Furthermore, the combinations augmented TAC and GSH/GSSG ratio and decreased ROS, nitrites + nitrates, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in supplemented neutrophils in vitro.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antioxidants</kwd><kwd>neutrophil extracellular traps</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>reactive nitrogen species</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Universidad de Guadalajara</funding-source><award-id>1.1.4.8.2</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Universidad de Guadalajara through &#8220;Programa de Apoyo a la Mejora en las Condiciones de Producci&#243;n de los miembros del SNI y SNCA (PROSNI, 1.1.4.8.2), 2019&#8211;2022&#8221;, &#8220;Programa de Fortalecimiento de la Investigaci&#243;n y el Posgrado (1.1.4.8.12) 2020&#8221;, &#8220;Programa de Fortalecimiento de Institutos, Centros y Laboratorios de Investigaci&#243;n 2021 (1.1.4.8.12)&#8221;, and Programa de Incorporaci&#243;n y Permanencia del Posgrado en el PNPC (PROINPEP), 2021&#8221;.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-24-13162"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Neutrophils are cells of the innate immune system that make up over 60% of the total white blood cells in the bloodstream. They are the first line of defense against invading pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses [<xref rid="B1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. NETs are defense mechanisms of neutrophils that form web-like structures composed of chromatin and antimicrobial molecules that are released to trap and kill invading pathogens [<xref rid="B4-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Excessive NET formation has been linked to harmful effects in the host [<xref rid="B5-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, various investigations have focused on uncovering the regulatory mechanisms of NETs.</p><p>During NET formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is crucial for pathogen elimination [<xref rid="B8-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but it can also cause oxidative stress and host damage by reacting with intracellular and extracellular molecules such as phospholipids, proteins, and DNA [<xref rid="B9-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophil activation leads to the assembly of the NADPH complex, which serves as the primary source of ROS. Upon assembly, the NADPH complex generates superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#9679;&#8722;</sup>), which is subsequently converted to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by the action of the superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> then interacts with intracellular Fe<sup>+2</sup> or Cu<sup>+2</sup>, resulting in the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>&#8722;</sup>) [<xref rid="B11-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Once neutrophils undergo NETosis, their ability to generate ROS is null. Nitric oxide (NO) is the main reactive nitrogen species (RNS) involved in NET formation, generating peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup>) and inducing protein nitration [<xref rid="B14-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The role of ROS in NET formation has been extensively studied, and it has been demonstrated that ROS is necessary for effective NET release. In diseases with alterations in ROS production in neutrophils, such as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), the process of NET formation is impaired, rendering the individuals more susceptible to recurrent infections [<xref rid="B16-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency, the interaction between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MPO is disrupted, and the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is defective [<xref rid="B17-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings highlight the crucial involvement of ROS and suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates redox homeostasis in healthy individuals and governs NET formation.</p><p>Organisms have developed exogenous and endogenous antioxidants to counteract the harmful effects of free radicals [<xref rid="B11-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Vitamins E and C are exogenous antioxidants obtained through the diet that can interact with each other, scavenge ROS, and protect against oxidative stress [<xref rid="B22-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas glutathione (GSH) is an endogenous antioxidant synthesized inside cells that can reduce oxidized vitamin C [<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Exogenous and endogenous antioxidants can interact with each other, improving the antioxidant capacity of cells. These interactions depend on the redox potential, chemical nature, and localization of each molecule (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Human concentrations of these vitamins have been described. For vitamin E, serum levels range from 22 to 28 &#181;M [<xref rid="B29-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Vitamin C levels have been characterized in many conditions in humans: deficient levels (0.003 mM), hypovitaminosis (0.03 mM), normal serum levels (0.1 mM), intracellular levels in neutrophils, and pharmacological levels (1&#8211;3 mM) [<xref rid="B30-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It has been reported that plasma levels of GSH in healthy subjects are 0.8 mM, while most cells present higher concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 mM depending on their metabolic activity [<xref rid="B27-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have revealed that GSH levels can increase through the supplementation of NAC either orally or intravenously [<xref rid="B35-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, commercial formulations, such as the University of Wisconsin Solution (UWS) for organ preservation, contain quantities similar to those reported inside the cell, including 2&#8211;3 mM [<xref rid="B37-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that antioxidants can suppress NET formation induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). For instance, vitamin C and NAC can reduce both NET formation and ROS, while &#945;-tocopherol appears to have no effect on NET formation but can reduce ROS [<xref rid="B31-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another study performed by Sae-Khow et al. with neutrophils from septic patients observed that low concentrations of ascorbate (1 mM) decreased spontaneous NETosis to that of normal healthy volunteers, while high concentrations of ascorbate (&#8805;10 mM) promoted NET formation [<xref rid="B38-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There is no information on the effect of these vitamins in human neutrophils stimulated with a natural stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a stimulus that is commonly present in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="B39-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, the synergistic effects of the vitamins and other antioxidants, such as GSH and NAC, have not been tested in NET formation assays.</p><p>Our investigation aims to clarify the effect of antioxidants alone: vitamins E and C, GSH, and NAC at reported concentrations in humans on NET formation induced by LPS in vitro. We also aim to demonstrate the effects of antioxidant combinations, including GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants, on LPS-stimulated neutrophils. This includes TAC, redox state, ROS and RNS production, and lipid peroxidation levels. Our results demonstrate that supplementing human neutrophils alone or in combination reduces LPS-induced NET formation. Furthermore, the GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidant supplementation of neutrophils augment the TAC of neutrophils, improve the redox state, decrease ROS and RNS, and prevent lipid peroxidation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.

The highest concentration of vitamin C exerted the strongest effect and was significantly better than the other concentrations. Fluorescent microscopy revealed the absence of NETs was observed in pre-loaded neutrophils with 3 mM of vitamin C (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>k). These findings demonstrate that vitamin C can decrease NET formation even at deficient concentrations in human blood. Moreover, at pharmacological concentrations, it can completely prevent NET formation. This is the first report to demonstrate that deficient concentrations of vitamin C can decrease NET formation.</p><p>Vitamin E showed similar results, with concentrations of 0.03 mM (serum level), 0.3 mM (adipocyte membrane concentration), and 1 mM (experimental concentration) significantly decreasing NETs in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c,d). Additionally, the highest concentration (1 mM) showed an effect consistent with the quantitative result in fluorescent microscopy (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>l). Our findings demonstrate that the serum concentration of vitamin E can control NET formation, and at higher concentrations (10 times; 0.3 mM or 33 times; 1 mM of the serum level), we can decrease NETs to near basal levels.</p><p>In turn, GSH at a concentration of 0.8 mM (serum level) significantly reduced NET formation, and the effect was slightly improved when a concentration of 2 mM was used (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e,f). Fluorescent microscopy showed consistent results, with NETs reduced to near basal levels (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>m). These findings demonstrate that serum and intracellular levels of GSH have the same effect on decreasing NET formation. Unlike the last two antioxidants, this is the first time that GSH has been used to study its effect on NET formation.</p><p>Finally, we used two different concentrations of NAC that were previously used by Kirchner et al. in 2013. Our results showed that a concentration of 5 mM was capable of significantly decreasing NET formation. Furthermore, when the concentration was increased to 10 mM, the effect was significantly improved (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>g,h), and no NETs were detected when observed with fluorescent microscopy (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>n).</p><p>This experiment demonstrates that vitamins C and E, GSH, and NAC can control NET formation in vitro at different levels depending on the concentration used. Furthermore, we found that high concentrations of these antioxidants can prevent NET formation to near basal levels, suggesting that redox balance is important in the context of NETs. However, it is important to note that antioxidants may be able to interact with each other and improve their effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.2. The Combination of GSH + NAC and ALL Antioxidants Completely Abolishes NET Formation</title><p>The antioxidant system of the cell works in synergy depending on the redox potential of their molecules and their chemical nature. To assess whether the suppressive effect of antioxidants improves when two or four antioxidants are added simultaneously, we pre-incubated neutrophils with two different antioxidants at previously used concentrations. Vitamins E and C were used at serum levels reported in healthy subjects (0.03 mM and 0.1 mM, respectively), while GSH was used at an intracellular concentration of 2 mM, and NAC was used at the experimental concentration that had the best effect on reducing NETs (10 mM). We found that the combination of GSH + NAC significantly improved its suppressive effect on NET formation when compared to their effects alone. The same effect was observed with ALL antioxidants (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b). Furthermore, fluorescent microscopy confirmed these results, with no NETs found in any sample with supplemented neutrophils (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c&#8211;f). Additionally, we assessed apoptosis and cytotoxicity in the treated neutrophils to confirm that the reduction in NET formation was not due to the death of neutrophils. Our results showed no significant effects on cell viability, suggesting that the observed decrease in NET formation was not a result of neutrophil death (<xref rid="app1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="app">Figures S1 and S2</xref>). These results demonstrate that when GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants are combined, their effect is so strong that it totally abolishes the NET formation. These combinations could improve the TAC of the neutrophils and maintain their redox balance; thus, NETs induced by ROS can be avoided.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.3. The Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) of the Neutrophils Is Enhanced When Supplemented with GSH + NAC and ALL Antioxidants</title><p>To determine if supplementing antioxidants improves the TAC of neutrophils, we initially assessed the antioxidant capacity of three components: the culture media, autologous serum (AS), and culture media with 2% AS. The culture media (RPMI 1640) exhibited 2.987 mM of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), while AS had 3.169 mM TEAC, and the culture media + 2% AS had the highest result with 5.203 mM TEAC (<xref rid="app1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). Furthermore, the culture media showed a significant improvement after antioxidant supplementation, particularly in those treated with GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants (<xref rid="app1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>). Upon determining the TAC of the culture media used in our experiments, we assessed the TAC of neutrophils incubated with antioxidants and stimulated with LPS for 3 h. Freshly isolated neutrophils exhibited a TEAC of 1.653 mM, which increased to 1.912 mM TEAC after one hour of pre-incubation in culture media with AS; however, after 3 h of stimulation with LPS, the TEAC values fell to 1.543. Moreover, pre-incubated neutrophils with GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants demonstrated TEAC values of 3.437 and 4.391 mM, respectively, despite being stimulated with LPS for 3 h (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that in vitro antioxidant supplementation of neutrophils enhances their antioxidant capacity, mainly in those that contain GSH + NAC, as well as ALL antioxidants. However, it is necessary to prove if the redox state of the neutrophils is improved with the use of antioxidants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.4. The Redox State (GSH/GSSG) of the Neutrophils Is Improved When Supplemented with GSH + NAC or ALL Antioxidants</title><p>We evaluated the redox state of neutrophils by measuring the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio before (freshly isolated neutrophils) and after pre-incubation with antioxidants. Freshly isolated neutrophils exhibited a ratio of 1.547, which significantly improved to 6.9541 with GSH + NAC and 7.731 with ALL antioxidants (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). Furthermore, when neutrophils were stimulated with LPS, the redox state increased slightly to 2.526 in the group without antioxidants, but it significantly increased to 9.9138 and 10.338 in those supplemented with GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants, respectively (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b). These results demonstrate that antioxidant combinations, such as GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants, can increase the GSH/GSSG ratio and improve the cell&#8217;s redox state. Although the mechanism by which neutrophils increase their GSH/GSSG ratio is unknown, this increase may be a protective response against lipid peroxidation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.5. The Amount of ROS Is Sustained at Basal Levels in Supplemented Neutrophils with GSH + NAC and ALL Antioxidants</title><p>To evaluate ROS scavenging by antioxidants, we first measured the production of ROS with the non-specific probe 2&#8242;,7&#8242;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein in its diacetate form (DCFH-DA) for 180 min. In the first 60 min, we measured ROS every 2 min, and after that, we performed measurements at 90, 120, and 180 min (<xref rid="app1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). We found that in the first 60 min, the negative control (neutrophils in RPMI 1640 + 2% AS) and the antioxidant-treated neutrophils with GSH + NAC and ALL presented similar values of median fluorescence intensity (MFI), even though these last mentioned were stimulated with LPS, whereas the neutrophils without antioxidant supplementation that were stimulated with LPS increased ROS production significantly and reached an average of 49.58 MFI (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a). When comparing the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROS production at 10 and 60 min, our findings showed that the combinations of GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants significantly maintained the ROS levels near basal values throughout both evaluated time intervals (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b,c). These results demonstrate that both combinations were effective in reducing ROS production from the beginning of LPS stimulation and maintained their suppressive effect until the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.6. The Combinations of GSH + NAC and ALL Antioxidants Decrease Nitrite + Nitrate Concentration in LPS-Stimulated Neutrophils</title><p>To evaluate the effect of antioxidants on nitrite + nitrate levels, we first measured their concentration in freshly isolated neutrophils. Next, we measured the levels in neutrophils pre-treated with GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants, which were then stimulated with LPS. We found that the nitrite + nitrate levels were 3.815 &#181;M in freshly isolated neutrophils, and this level increased to 87.807 &#181;M when the neutrophils were stimulated with LPS. However, when the neutrophils were pre-incubated with GSH + NAC, the effect of LPS on nitrite + nitrate concentration was reduced to 25.397 &#181;M. Moreover, the effect was even stronger with ALL antioxidants, which reduced the nitrite + nitrate levels to 12.852 &#181;M (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijms-24-13162"><title>2.7. The Neutrophils Supplemented with Antioxidants Maintain Basal Levels of MDA and Prevent Lipid Peroxidation When Stimulated with LPS</title><p>To assess the impact of antioxidant combinations on lipid peroxidation, we measured the level of MDA in neutrophils.

Subsequently, we measured the MDA levels after stimulation with LPS, which resulted in a significant increase up to 1.8257 &#181;M. However, we observed that neutrophils supplemented with antioxidants maintained normal levels of MDA even after the addition of LPS. Specifically, GSH + NAC-treated neutrophils exhibited MDA levels of 1.034 &#181;M, while ALL antioxidants resulted in MDA levels of 1.042 &#181;M. In all cases, MDA levels remained significantly unaltered until the end of the experiment (<xref rid="ijms-24-13162-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>ROS has been shown to play a crucial role in the process of NET formation. As a result, researchers have studied antioxidants over the past decade to control them both in vivo and in vitro. The vast majority of the available studies were performed with the chemical stimulus of PMA, a synthetic molecule that directly activates the NADPH complex without involving any receptor [<xref rid="B40-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This feature makes PMA less representative of physiological events. In the present work, we used LPS from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in our experiments since this molecule is present in human blood in normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, this molecule is present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is capable of interacting with neutrophil receptors to induce ROS production and undergo NETosis [<xref rid="B41-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the effect of vitamin C on NET formation. In our investigation, we found that vitamin C can reduce LPS-induced NETs in a dose-dependent manner from 0.003 mM to 3 mM. This is consistent with Kirchner and Mohammed&#8217;s previous findings when they used concentrations of 2 mM and 3 mM, respectively. Interestingly, we found that even at concentrations of vitamin C that were considered deficient (0.003 mM) and insufficient (0.03 mM) in humans, there was a decrease in NET formation, and the effect became stronger with the concentration of serum levels (0.1 mM) and intracellular levels reported in neutrophils (1.5 mM). This contrasts with Kirchner and Mohammed&#8217;s findings, who did not observe any reduction using lower concentrations (0.2 and 0.3 mM, respectively). The differences in results may be due to the use of different NET inducers: PMA in Kirchner and Mohammed&#8217;s studies and LPS from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in our study. Additionally, it should be mentioned that we added the antioxidant to the media, which means that vitamin C could be available for neutrophils if needed. This is important because neutrophils can reach intracellular concentrations of up to 1.5 mM of vitamin C through the SVCT2 transporter [<xref rid="B43-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and when activated with PMA, concentrations can increase by two orders of magnitude due to the transport of its oxidized form via GLUT3 [<xref rid="B44-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our results reinforce previous findings of vitamin C on NET formation in vitro and demonstrate that the availability of ascorbic acid, even at low levels, is fundamental in the context of NET formation, and underscore the importance of vitamin C in neutrophil function due to its high solubility, efficient transport properties within the cell, and its ability to interact with vitamin E to maintain cell membrane integrity.</p><p>Vitamin E is present in all cell membrane complexes and has been shown to protect against lipid peroxidation by indirectly reacting with ROS [<xref rid="B24-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, we found that concentrations of vitamin E ranging from 0.03 to 1 mM reduced NET formation in neutrophils stimulated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner. This contrasts with Kirchner et al. (2013), who did not observe any reduction of NET formation in human neutrophils supplemented with 0.05 mM of &#945;-tocopherol. This discrepancy may be due to the difference in vitamin E dosages and the use of PMA as a stimulus. Another study carried out by Vorobjeva et al. reported similar results to ours using a soluble analog of vitamin E called Trolox at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mM [<xref rid="B45-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. They found a dose-dependent effect on reducing NET formation. However, Trolox is localized in the soluble portions of the cell, making this molecule difficult to compare with the physiological role of &#945;-tocopherol.</p><p>Plasma levels of GSH in healthy subjects are reported to be 800 &#181;M, while most cells present higher intracellular concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 mM. Our study found that supplementing neutrophils with 0.8 mM and 2 mM of GSH resulted in a dramatic reduction of NETs, with an average of 50% and 55% fewer NETs, respectively. The effect was slightly better than that with the highest concentrations of vitamins C and E, possibly due to the higher molar concentration of GSH and its electronegativity compared to that of vitamins E and C. Our findings emphasize the significance of GSH in controlling NETs and prompt further investigation into how neutrophils utilize GSH, given the difficulties of transporting it inside the cell. Further research is necessary to better comprehend the mechanisms underlying the GSH effects on NET formation and its potential therapeutic applications.</p><p>NAC is a commonly used medication for treating acetaminophen toxicity and has been studied for its antioxidant properties in treating free radical damage [<xref rid="B46-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cysteine is known to be the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of GSH, and NAC provides L-cysteine to support GSH maintenance [<xref rid="B47-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our experiments showed that NAC can suppress NET formation when used at high concentrations (10 mM), which is consistent with Kirchner&#8217;s findings that 10 mM effectively reduced NET formation in vitro. However, we did not observe a significant effect at the concentration of 5 mM, which contrasts with the results of Kirchner, who used the same concentration and found a significant reduction. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the stimuli used in Kirchner&#8217;s study (PMA) and that used in ours (LPS). Additionally, it must be considered that once NAC is deacetylated, cysteine is rapidly oxidized to cystine, which may limit its antioxidant effect at low concentrations [<xref rid="B48-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Further research is needed to better understand the effect of NAC on NET formation induced by a natural stimulus.</p><p>As previously mentioned, some antioxidants work together inside the cell to enhance antioxidant capacity. For example, vitamin E, vitamin C, and GSH interact to improve antioxidant function. Other molecules, such as NAC, provide the necessary components for the synthesis of GSH. Our study tested two combinations of antioxidants for the first time: (1) GSH (2 mM) + NAC (10 mM) and (2) vitamin E (0.03 mM) + vitamin C (0.1 mM) + GSH (2 mM) + NAC (10 mM). We found that the combination of GSH + NAC had a suppressive effect on NET formation that reached basal levels. Furthermore, when we tested ALL antioxidants, we observed an improvement in the suppressive effect on NET formation when compared with the combination of GSH + NAC, although this difference was not statistically significant. It is possible that the combination of ALL may have a differential effect on other parameters related to oxidative stress. Moreover, it is important to note that the amounts of vitamin E and vitamin C used were insignificant compared to the concentrations of NAC and GSH. Therefore, this may be the reason why we did not observe a significant effect when comparing both combinations. In addition to our main findings, we conducted further assessments to evaluate the effect of supplemented antioxidants on neutrophil viability. Specifically, we performed determinations of apoptosis/necrosis and cytotoxicity using flow cytometry and colorimetric techniques, respectively. Our results revealed no significant differences in viability between the negative controls and the neutrophils supplemented with antioxidants in both experiments (<xref rid="app1-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). These findings indicate that the supplementation of antioxidants does not have an adverse effect on neutrophil viability. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that these molecules can interact with each other, improving the neutrophil capacity to avoid NET formation when stimulated with LPS in vitro.</p><p>The TAC of neutrophils has been studied in various contexts, including exercise, infection, and disease. For example, studies have shown that antioxidant supplementation can enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes in neutrophils, while oxidative stress can impair neutrophil function [<xref rid="B49-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Researchers have studied the effects of antioxidants, including vitamin E, vitamin C, and NAC, on NET formation. However, the determination of the TAC in this context has yet to be fully understood. In our experiments, we observed an increase in TAC when comparing freshly isolated neutrophils to those that were supplemented with antioxidants. The TAC of freshly isolated neutrophils doubled in value compared with neutrophils supplemented with GSH + NAC and ALL the antioxidants. In both cases of supplemented neutrophils, the improvement observed was twice as high as the basal levels. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of antioxidants inside the neutrophil cells could reduce NET formation by improving its TAC. These findings highlight the significance of comprehending the TAC of neutrophils and the role of antioxidant availability in preserving their function and safeguarding against oxidative damage. However, further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in how this increase in TAC is achieved.</p><p>The ratio of GSH to GSSG is an essential indicator of cellular redox balance in various cell types, including immune cells. The GSH/GSSG ratio is used as an indicator of cellular oxidative stress. Oxidative perturbations can cause a redistribution of GSH and GSSG, resulting in a shift in the GSH/GSSG ratio, which reflects the oxidized redox status within a cell [<xref rid="B47-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our study revealed that freshly isolated neutrophils had a GSH/GSSG ratio of 1.547. However, when supplemented with GSH + NAC or ALL antioxidants, the ratio significantly improved to 6.954 and 7.731, respectively. Furthermore, when we stimulated the supplemented neutrophils with LPS for 3 h, their GSH/GSSG ratio increased to 9.913 in the group with GSH + NAC and 10.333 in the group with ALL antioxidants. No reports have been found regarding GSH/GSSG levels in neutrophils. However, previous studies have reported that the GSH/GSSG ratio in the monocytes and T cells of healthy children ranges from 12 to 25 and from 10 to 24, respectively [<xref rid="B50-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our findings show similar values to these previous reports, although it must be considered that our measurements were performed in neutrophils from healthy young adults that were seeded in cell culture media (RPMI 1640) + 2% AS supplemented with a mixture of antioxidants (GSH + NAC and ALL) and stimulated with LPS. The concentration of the GSH/GSSG ratio may vary depending on several factors, including the subjects involved, the specific media used, and the interactions among the molecules present. Regarding the increments in the redox potential after stimulation with LPS, this could be because of the antioxidant-enriched environment, the interaction of these antioxidants, and the activation of antioxidant response elements (AREs) after LPS stimulation through Nrf2 [<xref rid="B51-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] that promotes GSH synthesis [<xref rid="B52-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], although these assumptions should be proven with further experiments. While most studies on the GSH/GSSG determination have focused on brain cells or tissues, just a few studies have been conducted on immune cells. This is the first time that GSH/GSSG ratio is measured in neutrophil cultures and provides new information about its function in NET formation. However, further experiments are needed to describe the kinetics of the redox potential maintenance in supplemented neutrophils.</p><p>ROS and NET formation have been the focus of recent investigations in various diseases; however, the biological regulation during this process remains to be elucidated. Our experiments showed that the levels of ROS increased significantly in the first 10 min in the positive control and reached another peak at 60 min. The neutrophils that were pre-incubated with the combinations of antioxidants GSH + NAC and ALL showed values similar to those observed in the negative control, despite being stimulated with LPS. In 2012, Kirchner et al. [<xref rid="B9-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that the formation of NETs depends on the generation of ROS, and in 2013, they conducted a study on the effect of various antioxidants on ROS production in NET formation. They found that neutrophils supplemented with vitamin C at concentrations of 0.2 and 2 mM showed a significant reduction in ROS production [<xref rid="B32-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our findings provide novel information on the antioxidant effects of GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants on ROS production. Both combinations could reduce ROS levels to near basal levels, emphasizing the importance of antioxidant supplementation for neutrophils to prevent oxidative stress. However, further research is needed to elucidate the type of ROS that are being scavenged.</p><p>It has been described that RNS plays an important role in NET formation; however, there is limited information available on this topic. We measured, for the first time, nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>) + nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>) levels as RNS indicators in supplemented neutrophils. In our results, we found basal levels of 3.81 &#181;M of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>, and this concentration increased significantly to 87.80 &#181;M after LPS stimulation. We also found that the combination of GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants significantly reduced nitrite + nitrate levels to 25.39 and 12.85 &#181;M, respectively. The basal values that we found are higher than previously reported by Singh et al. (2.8&#8211;3 &#181;M/10<sup>7</sup> cells) [<xref rid="B53-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; however, the increase after stimulation is consistent with previous studies that have assessed NO and ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup> [<xref rid="B14-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been described that NO undergoes various reactions in biological fluids, resulting in the production of nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8722;</sup>); however, it must be considered that nitrite/nitrate levels do not reflect the amount of NO or ONOO<sup>&#8722;</sup>. Here, we describe that these final products augment during NET formation but can be reduced through the action of antioxidant combinations such as GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants. Further investigations are necessary to comprehend the role of RNS in neutrophils, which can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of NET formation.</p><p>MDA is a widely used biomarker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Several studies have investigated the role of MDA in neutrophils and its association with various diseases. We measured the MDA levels in freshly isolated neutrophils in our experiments and observed a significant increase after LPS stimulation from 1.06 to 1.82 &#181;M of MDA. Our findings also showed that combining GSH + NAC and ALL antioxidants significantly prevented the increment of MDA and maintained basal levels (1.03 and 1.04 &#181;M of MDA, respectively). MDA levels have been reported in various cell culture assays, including cardiomyocytes (4 &#181;M) [<xref rid="B54-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], neurons (0.4 nmol/mg) [<xref rid="B55-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and serum (0.2 &#181;M) [<xref rid="B56-ijms-24-13162" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], among others. However, MDA levels in neutrophil cultures have not yet been determined. These describe, for the first time, the MDA levels in cultured neutrophils and compare their levels after stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antioxidant combinations used can avoid lipid peroxidation in neutrophils. However, it must be considered that MDA is also formed from other compounds such as deoxyribose, sodium benzoate, and flavone C glucosides, among others. Therefore, further experiments are needed to elucidate the implications of lipid peroxidation on NET formation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-24-13162"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>It has been demonstrated that LPS is found in human blood in health and disease conditions. Therefore, it is important to conduct investigations with this type of inductor to properly describe physiological effects. In our investigation, we have demonstrated that vitamin C is highly effective in reducing LPS-induced NETs, even at low doses that are considered insufficient or deficient. We also demonstrated that vitamin E and GSH are effective at doses reported in human serum, with a stronger effect at higher concentrations. By combining antioxidants, such as GSH + NAC and ALL, the reduction of NETs is more effective compared to using antioxidants alone, and these combinations positively affect various parameters, including TAC, redox state of the cell, ROS and RNS production, and lipid peroxidation. The findings of our study provide new information about neutrophil biology and raise several important questions regarding the role of antioxidant molecules in these cells. Our results suggest a potential link between antioxidants and neutrophil function, mainly in controlling NET formation. However, further investigations are necessary to fully understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the antioxidant function, including the role of enzymes like MPO, antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) nitric oxide synthase (NOS), catalase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as to evaluate whether supplemented neutrophils can effectively eliminate bacteria or fungi. By delving deeper into these mechanisms, we will be able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how antioxidants impact neutrophil biology and potentially develop novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, future studies could explore the potential interactions between antioxidants and other cellular processes, such as inflammation and immune response, to provide a more holistic view of their role in neutrophil function. Overall, these results highlight the need for continued research in this area to unravel the complexities of antioxidant-mediated processes in neutrophils and their implications for human health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to Mariel Chagollan, Celia Guerrero, B.S.
