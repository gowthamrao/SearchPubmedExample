</p></notes></front><body><sec id="add14146-sec-0008"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meta&#8208;analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that five additional smokers will quit for every 100 smokers allocated to varenicline rather than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) <xref rid="add14146-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. These meta&#8208;analyses have also shown that patients allocated to varenicline are unlikely to be at increased risk of short&#8208;term neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular adverse events <xref rid="add14146-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="add14146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Both randomized trials and observational studies have suggested that patients prescribed varenicline are less likely to smoke in the short term <xref rid="add14146-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="add14146-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. These reductions in smoking should translate into health benefits in the years following treatment. However, we have relatively little evidence about the effects of prescribing varenicline in primary care on health outcomes in the years following treatment.</p><p>Experimental evidence about the effects of prescribing varenicline on health more than a year after prescription is limited, because trials of smoking cessation medications rarely have follow&#8208;up greater than a year. Furthermore, the number of participants in clinical trials is relatively low and trial participants are unlikely to be representative of patients in primary care. In addition, adherence to treatment regimens in RCTs may not be comparable to everyday clinical care, and there may be selective outcome reporting of trials. Hence, trials provide relatively little evidence about the longer&#8208;term effects of smoking cessation therapy on outcomes that are perhaps most important to smokers and clinicians, such as mortality, hospitalization and attendance to primary care. A recent observational study investigated the association of smoking cessation medications and cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric adverse events. However, it had a limited follow&#8208;up of 6&#160;months, did not investigate important outcomes such as mortality and hospitalization and suffered potentially from residual confounding <xref rid="add14146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>.</p><p>Residual confounding is a major issue, because patients prescribed varenicline tend to be healthier than those prescribed NRT <xref rid="add14146-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Traditional epidemiological methods attempt to account for these differences by adjusting for or matching on observed differences using multivariable adjusted regression or propensity scores. These methods depend upon the assumption that there are no unmeasured differences between those prescribed varenicline and NRT. This assumption is implausible. There are many differences between patients that are difficult or impossible to measure in databases of electronic medical records, such as socio&#8208;economic position, genetics and strength of addiction. An alternative approach is instrumental variable analysis, which exploits different assumptions&#160;<xref rid="add14146-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. An instrumental variable is a naturally occurring variation in the data set that can be used as a proxy for intervention the patient received. Instruments are defined by three assumptions. First, the instrument must be associated with the likelihood of receiving an intervention. Secondly, the association of the instrument and the outcome must not be confounded. Thirdly, the instrument must only affect the outcome through its effect on the likelihood of receiving the intervention. Physicians&#8217; preferences for one medication over another are a potential instrument for the medications they prescribe to their patients <xref rid="add14146-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Physicians who prefer varenicline are more likely to prescribe it. Physicians&#8217; preferences for varenicline may not relate to their patients&#8217; baseline comorbidities. Finally, physicians&#8217; preferences should not affect their patients&#8217; outcomes directly, independent of the prescription they issue. If these assumptions hold, then instrumental variable analysis would provide unbiased estimates of the causal effect of varenicline.</p><p>We have used these methods to provide evidence that varenicline causes patients to be more likely to quit smoking <xref rid="add14146-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. In the current study, we investigated if smokers prescribed varenicline had lower risks of serious ill&#8208;health compared to those prescribed NRT during the 4 years following treatment. We used three approaches to control for potential confounding: multivariable adjusted analyses, propensity score matched analyses and instrumental variable regression using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Previous studies have used data from UK electronic medical records to investigate the effects of varenicline on neuropsychiatric outcomes <xref rid="add14146-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. We add to these results by investigating the effects of smoking cessation therapy on mortality, outcomes in primary and secondary care and the frequency of primary care consultations.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0009"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective cohort study of all people prescribed varenicline or NRT in a sample of primary care practices in the United Kingdom. All hypotheses and analyses were pre&#8208;specified and a study protocol was published <xref rid="add14146-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. The CPRD's terms and conditions for accessing the data do not allow us to disseminate individual level patient data. However, researchers interested in accessing the data should contact the CPRD directly (<email>enquires@cprd.com</email>).

The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02681848">NCT02681848</ext-link>) and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/g9ch2/).</p><sec id="add14146-sec-0010"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The CPRD contains records from more than 15 million people, who are representative of the population of the United Kingdom <xref rid="add14146-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. More than 98% of the UK population are registered with a general practitioner (GP). GPs provide access to National Health Service (NHS) services, and patients are limited to a choice of GP practice within their geographical area. Data on mortality and hospital admission from the UK Office of National Statistics and the Hospital Episodes Statistics data sets have been linked to all the practices included in this analysis. People who attended linked practices are similar to those from unlinked practices <xref rid="add14146-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. We restricted our analysis to people with &#8216;acceptable&#8217; records at practices which were designated as &#8216;up&#8208;to&#8208;standard&#8217; by the CPRD <xref rid="add14146-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Acceptable records were those with information on the date of birth and sex, first registration date and no breaks in their registration. Up&#8208;to&#8208;standard practices provided continuous reporting of data and reported when their patients registered at and left the practice. We sampled all those prescribed NRT or varenicline by a GP at a linked practice after 1 September 2006 (when varenicline was introduced to the United Kingdom) until the end of follow&#8208;up in the linked data on 31 March 2014. We included people who were issued their first prescription of either varenicline or NRT within the study period. To ensure that patients were starting a new course of treatment, and there had been sufficient registration period to define covariates, we excluded prescriptions issued to people who were prescribed smoking cessation medications in the 18&#160;months prior to the start of study follow&#8208;up. To ensure sufficient medical history to define covariates, we excluded prescriptions issued to people who registered at a practice within the previous year. We excluded people prescribed both NRT and varenicline on the same day.

We did this for two reasons: first, to ensure that our analysis was comparable to an intention&#8208;to&#8208;treat analysis in a randomized controlled trial <xref rid="add14146-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="add14146-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>; and secondly, because treatment&#8208;switching will be related strongly to the characteristics of participants, so that analyses which model treatment&#8208;switching are likely to suffer from residual confounding. We estimated the effect of initially prescribing varenicline compared to initially prescribing NRT. We did not investigate another smoking cessation agent, bupropion, because it is rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom, and large randomized trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that it is less efficacious than varenicline <xref rid="add14146-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="add14146-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0012"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Our primary outcome was all&#8208;cause mortality 2&#160;years after the first prescription.

Both multivariable adjusted and instrumental variable regression suggested that patients prescribed varenicline attended primary care less frequently during the 2 years following the first prescription.</p><p>Patients prescribed varenicline were healthier than those prescribed NRT at baseline in almost all ways we could measure. It is, therefore, likely that there are differences in terms of unobserved characteristics (i.e. genetics, income, education, strength of addiction and motivation to quit). Hence, the results from multivariable adjusted and propensity score matched regression are unlikely to reflect the causal effect of prescribing varenicline, as both approaches depend upon the assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders. This may explain why we found implausibly large short&#8208;term differences in all&#8208;cause and cause&#8208;specific mortality in the multivariable adjusted and propensity score regression. In contrast, the instrumental variable analysis suggested little short&#8208;term effect of prescribing varenicline versus NRT on mortality; these results are more robust to confounding by unobserved patient characteristics (healthy user bias). We found consistent evidence from all approaches that patients prescribed varenicline subsequently experienced increases in weight and attended primary care less frequently. This may suggest that varenicline affects weight and GP attendance, potentially via its effects on smoking cessation. In contrast, the other outcomes we investigated may not be affected as strongly by varenicline (and smoking cessation) as implied by the partially or fully or multivariable adjusted differences. It is conceivable that a similar bias afflicts results from other observational studies of the effect of smoking cessation <xref rid="add14146-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>.</p><sec id="add14146-sec-0025"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A key strength of our study is that we used three different statistical techniques to address residual confounding, multivariable adjusted, propensity score and instrumental variable regression. Our multivariable adjusted results could suffer from residual confounding and healthy user bias. During this period there were safety warnings and scientific papers which suggested that patients prescribed varenicline might be at increased risk of neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular adverse events. This could explain why patients prescribed varenicline were healthier at baseline. To overcome this, we used three different approaches to control for differences between patients that depend upon distinct assumptions. While the multivariable adjusted association with mortality was large and attenuated only modestly after adjustment for observed confounders, the instrumental variable results suggested little short&#8208;term reduction in mortality. Therefore, the association of varenicline prescriptions and mortality observed in the multivariable and propensity score regression analyses is likely to be due to residual confounding. The instrumental variable results could suffer from bias if there are unobserved confounders affecting the instrument, the physicians&#8217; preferences and the outcome <xref rid="add14146-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. We investigated this in terms of observed characteristics of the patients and found that the instruments tended to much less associated with the observed confounders than the actual prescription the patient received. This is consistent with the instrumental variable results being less biased.</p><p>Patients prescribed smoking cessation medication may receive other cessation support (e.g. one&#8208;on&#8208;one or group smoking cessation sessions). If patients prescribed varenicline have a different likelihood of receiving these interventions compared to those prescribed NRT, then it could bias our observational results. The CPRD does not contain detailed information on referrals to smoking cessation services. Treatment differences by prescription issued would not necessarily bias our instrumental variable estimates. However, if physicians who preferred varenicline were also more likely to prescribe other interventions, this could bias our instrumental variable results positively.</p><p>Only a proportion (73%) of patients prescribed varenicline received more than one prescription in the 3&#8208;month treatment period, and only 20% received sufficient tablets to complete a course of treatment. This means that our results may underestimate the effects of complying with treatment (as opposed to the effects of being prescribed treatment). While the effect of prescribing treatment is of more interest to clinicians, the effect of complying is perhaps of most interest to patients. However, it is difficult to estimate the effects of compliance, independently of treatment initiation, because compliance is non&#8208;random.</p><p>A strength of our study is that we published a protocol and pre&#8208;specified our primary outcome <xref rid="add14146-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. A potential limitation of our study is that we had no data on patients&#8217; use of over&#8208;the&#8208;counter NRT. This means that patients observed in our study may have attempted to quit previously without attending primary care. However, as varenicline is only available via prescription in the United Kingdom, we are likely to have observed all uses of varenicline. However, smokers who purchase over&#8208;the&#8208;counter NRT are unlikely to be representative of patients who attend primary care for smoking cessation advice. Therefore, even if we had the data, users of over&#8208;the&#8208;counter NRT are unlikely to be an appropriate control group for patients prescribed varenicline. Furthermore, our results relate to the initial decision to prescribe either varenicline or NRT, which may not reflect the effects of longer&#8208;term prescribing. Our results are therefore likely to be representative of the treatment decisions and outcomes of patients who consult with physicians about smoking cessation.</p><p>Our outcomes were derived from validated code lists and algorithms. However, it is possible that not all adverse events are coded in the patients&#8217; electronic medical records. While this is a concern for the primary care diagnoses, there is unlikely to be missing information for hospital admissions or all&#8208;cause mortality. These data come from linked national administrative records and validation studies have found that they record outcomes <xref rid="add14146-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">accurately [26]</xref>.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we only followed patients for up to 4 years. This means we were not able to test whether prescribing varenicline affected long&#8208;term health outcomes. Many of the adverse health conditions associated with tobacco consumption are the result of many years of cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g. lung cancer). Future studies could follow&#8208;up patients for longer using routine health records and potentially use recently proposed instrumental variable estimators for survival analysis <xref rid="add14146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0026"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Our instrumental variable results suggested that varenicline was unlikely to have large effects on risk of coronary heart disease mortality in the year following first prescription (risk difference (RD) per 100 patients treated&#160;=&#160;0.05%, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;&#8211;0.11 to 0.21%; hospitalization due to coronary heart disease (RD&#160;=&#160;0.34%, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;0.00 to 0.68%); or primary care diagnoses of myocardial infarction (RD&#160;=&#160;0.08%, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;&#8211;0.13 to 0.29%). This means we can exclude a greater than 1 in 147 increase in risk of coronary heart disease mortality; this is likely to be smaller than the longer&#8208;term reduction in risk of cardiovascular events caused by quitting smoking. In comparison, a network meta&#8208;analysis of randomized trials found that participants allocated to varenicline had similar rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (RD&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.06%, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;&#8211;0.14 to 0.17%, assuming 0.2 events per 100 allocated to NRT) <xref rid="add14146-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. The CATS trial (Cardiac Assessments Following Different Treatments of Smoking Cessation Medications in Subjects With and Without Psychiatric Disorders), an extension to the EAGLES study (Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study)<bold>,</bold> found that participants allocated to varenicline had similar risk of major adverse cardiovascular events to those allocated to NRT in the 6&#8211;12&#160;months following treatment (RD&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.15%, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;&#8211;0.44 to 0.14%) <xref rid="add14146-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. However, the follow&#8208;up to this study was relatively short. The multivariable adjusted estimates of the effect of varenicline on rates of primary care diagnosis of myocardial infarction were similar in magnitude to a previous observational study using electronic medical records <xref rid="add14146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0027"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The CPRD is representative of the United Kingdom, therefore our results are likely to reflect the association of smoking cessation medications and adverse outcomes in primary care in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the individuals in our study are likely to have more comorbidity and be more representative of the general population than participants of randomized controlled trials. Whereas only seven (0.09%)of 8058 participants in the EAGLES trial died within 24&#160;weeks of randomization, 740 (0.72%) of 103&#8201;162 patients in the CPRD died within 6 months of first prescription. Our instrumental variable results estimate a so&#8208;called &#8216;local average treatment effect&#8217;, under the assumption of a monotonic effect of the instrument on the likelihood of being prescribed varenicline <xref rid="add14146-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. This assumption requires that a patient who is prescribed varenicline by a physician who prefers NRT would also receive varenicline had they attended a physician who preferred varenicline, and vice versa. This is the average effect of varenicline in patients whose treatment was affected by their physician's preferences. These estimates may not be valid for other patients; for example, patients who have strong contraindications for varenicline.</p><p>Patients who were prescribed varenicline as part of their everyday clinical care experienced similar rates of adverse health outcomes to patients prescribed NRT during the 4 years following treatment. There were few differences in rates of all&#8208;cause and cause&#8208;specific mortality or hospitalization. However, consistent with previous studies <xref rid="add14146-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, patients prescribed varenicline gained more weight and had a higher risk of diabetes. These results raise questions about the effects of prescribing varenicline on health in the years following treatment. Patients who quit smoking may need additional health monitoring in the years following cessation.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0028"><title>Study registration</title><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02681848">NCT02681848</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="add14146-sec-0029"><title>Data access</title><p>The statistical code used to produce these results can be accessed here: (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nmdavies/varenicline-safety">https://github.com/nmdavies/varenicline-safety</ext-link>).
