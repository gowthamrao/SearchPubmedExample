Death from opioid misuse, nonopioid illicit use (ie, cocaine, methamphetamine), and alcohol misuse continue to increase annually with significant variation between geographic regions, race, and ethnicity.<xref rid="ooad092-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Stimulant-related hospitalizations are also on the rise, with nearly one-third of all substance misuse-related emergency department (ED) visits involving alcohol.<xref rid="ooad092-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> While poisoning and withdrawal are the most recognized causes of hospitalizations among patients with substance misuse, many indirect causes related to substance misuse include noncommunicable diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease), infectious diseases (ie, hepatitis, wound infections, endocarditis, sepsis), and trauma (intentional and unintentional; ie, car accidents).<xref rid="ooad092-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5&#8211;8</sup></xref> Recognizing this, the National Drug Control Strategy (NDCC) recommends that regional public health agencies shift away from focusing solely on substance-related fatalities to using data from nonfatal events for designing treatment, interventions, and policies to combat the substance misuse epidemic.<xref rid="ooad092-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, a significant impediment to implementing these guidelines is the fragmentation of data across health systems and public health surveillance entities. For example, state agencies collect information on ED visits, prehospital ambulance runs, socioeconomic factors, and housing status but are limited in linking with more comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Therefore, there is a need for a data platform that integrates information from multiple entities, thereby presenting a comprehensive picture crucial to inform harm reduction policies.</p><p>Within health informatics, the use of data commons has increased over recent years.

<xref rid="ooad092-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref> describes the data owners, data linkage, and final data curation of the SMDC. We used a population health design approach that identifies substance misuse patients from a health system and connects them to out-of-hospital data modalities, thereby developing a regional perspective of health systems and their catchment areas with better data integration within and outside the EHR. Our population health approach follows a similar definition to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Population Health and is different from traditional public health research.<xref rid="ooad092-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The SMDC includes adult (18&#160;years or older) patients with ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations and at least 1 encounter with a substance use-related diagnosis code at 2 University of Wisconsin (UW) hospitals in Dane County, WI, between 2008 and 2022. Substance-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 codes from existing UW Hospital EHR data were used to identify patients with substance misuse.<xref rid="ooad092-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A total of 342 International Classification of Diseases codes for misuse across alcohol, opioids, stimulants, depressants, and illicit drugs were included (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).

The IRB and each contract were carefully crafted to allow future users to be added for related projects with opt-out options by the data owners on IRB-approved projects.

The PPRL was licensed and subscribed through Datavant software for all data-contributing sites. Each data-contributing entity generated deidentified universal patient keys (tokens) by running the software on-premises behind firewalls for each data owner. The token generation process was accomplished by processing identifiable demographic attributes (eg, first name, last name, date of birth) through a cryptographic hashing process that produces a series of encrypted keys certified as deidentified data under the HIPAA Expert Determination standard, which remains with each data owner. The output hash was then encrypted using a site-specific key, ensuring each data owner&#8217;s tokens were unique with a subsequent step to hash again, and 1-way transit tokens were sent to the SMDC honest broker (ie, the Office of the Honest Broker in the School of Medicine and Public Health at UW-Madison) for linkage. The honest broker is a neutral entity located outside of any research team or data-contributing site, serving as an escrow for the tokens and utilizing the Datavant software as a central hub.<xref rid="ooad092-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Notably, the honest broker did not receive, store, or process any protected health information (PHI). The PHI from tokens remained with the data owners, and only the related data attributes, ie, the non-PHI data variables from each owner, were sent along with the tokens. Additionally, no transit token could be linked back to the site token, thereby protecting against the reidentification of any individual.</p><p>The honest broker at UW&#8217;s central hub facilitated study-specific central mapping that represented records linked using the transit tokens from the various data owners (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> for the list of tokens). The &#8220;Net Tokens&#8221; matching algorithm was used for the linkages. In this algorithm, a match is identified when comparing all available tokens when the number of matching tokens across 5 attributes (first/last name, address, gender, social security number, and birth date) exceeded the number of nonmatches (ie, majority rules).<xref rid="ooad092-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The algorithm was robust to varying linkage accuracies of the underlying information (ie, when different tokens are available across data contributors) with linkage performance as successful as 97.9% precision and 90.3% recall.<xref rid="ooad092-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The honest broker performed a final crosswalk across datasets to provide the research team with a set of deidentified patient identification numbers as the relational key across the modalities of data.</p><p>The final linked dataset underwent quality checks and was organized according to the Kahn Framework.<xref rid="ooad092-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> A mirrored approach was also followed for state agency data.

Our approach uses PPRL to link state-level public health data with longitudinal EHR and national mortality datasets, providing an opportunity to fully grasp the incidence and response for <italic toggle="yes">all</italic> conditions related to substance misuse with a focus on all-cause mortality. To the best of our knowledge, the SMDC is the first public&#8211;private&#8211;academic partnership to adhere to the regulatory, legal, and privacy needs of vulnerable populations and provide a unique environment for addiction research using longitudinal data that span multiple data modalities. Importantly, our proof-of-concept serves as a roadmap for developing a population health-driven framework to foster better engagement and data sharing between health systems and surrounding county and state agencies.</p><p>Since 2019, mortality from drug overdoses and alcohol-related causes in the United States has risen 10% per year.<xref rid="ooad092-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Furthermore, substance misuse is a leading cause of hospital readmissions.<xref rid="ooad092-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Public health agencies tasked with designing local treatments and interventions have primarily focused on fatal events. Despite this, the substance misuse epidemic has continued unabated, prompting the Office of National Drug Control Policy to issue a recommendation to shift focus to warning signs&#8212;ED visits, hospitalizations, or encounters with the legal system&#8212;that lie on the path to more severe events.<xref rid="ooad092-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> In practice, however, clinical providers and policymakers do not have access to a unified record of information critical to enforce these recommendations.</p><p>Other states have executed different models of data linkage to study substance misuse conditions but have inherent limitations. For example, Massachusetts passed new state-level legislation to link data across state agencies to enable data sharing for opiate-related overdose events.<xref rid="ooad092-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, EHR data are only used to record overdose events, and the full breadth of data available in the EHR that captures rich information related to nonoverdose conditions remains unused. Additionally, the data are linked deterministically, ie, only exact matches, and thus could be missing key events. In another study, North Carolina used a combination of probabilistic and deterministic linkage to link multiple data sources for tracking fatal or nonfatal (eg, received naloxone) overdose events but do not consider other substance misuse conditions.<xref rid="ooad092-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Similarly, Maryland studied unintentional overdose deaths (derived from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner) and used probabilistic methods to link data with incarceration and parole records, ED visits, and hospitalizations for overdose from hospital discharge records, social services, and cases from juvenile services.<xref rid="ooad092-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, their focus remains on linking data for overdose deaths only and cannot be used to study substance misuse-related events leading up to death. Outside of the United States, a study set in New South Wales, Australia linked hospital and ED data with ambulance, cancer registry, court and incarceration records, and a national death database in a probabilistic manner to describe individuals with problematic alcohol use.<xref rid="ooad092-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Our study adds to this body of work by creating a broad repository with the inclusion of more EHR data on all physical ailments and conditions for patients with recorded misuse of alcohol, opioids, stimulants, depressants, and illicit drugs. Our population health systems approach to addressing the substance misuse epidemic offers regional hospitals and public health departments leverage and information to implement evidence-based strategies to reduce preventable substance use-related hospitalizations and deaths. Our approaches can be translated to other regions and states where the substance misuse epidemic continues unabated. Notably, using our codes and data linkage methods can reduce the time to establish a data commons to improve the strategies for region-specific prevention, treatment, and harm reduction.</p><p>Our study also highlights methods to create a new framework for secure and private data sharing. Ethical, legal, and organizational reasons often prevent the sharing of sensitive data by medical and service providers with outside collaborators and peers. Data security is becoming more crucial for patients with substance misuse as extra protection is needed for this vulnerable population. The PPRL approach addresses these challenges and enables secure, large-scale data sharing.<xref rid="ooad092-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Similar approaches have been used recently to democratize EHR data in national data networks (eg, PCORnet and the National Covid Cohort Collaborative).<xref rid="ooad092-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> We exercise further precautions by using the services of an honest broker who is positioned independently in the university and is not part of the commercial data linkage service company. Overall, we were able to acquire non-EHR information related to substance misuse for over half of our EHR-based cohort. Our study is the first to utilize PPRL and honest-broker services for linking a health system with state agencies to build a data commons for substance misuse research.</p><p>Our approach also highlights the utility of using multiple mortality datasets to capture both in-hospital and out-of-hospital deaths in hospitalized patients with substance misuse. The SMDC allows health systems, state health departments, and public policymakers to follow the NDCC recommendations to focus on nonoverdose-related events for substance misuse prevention and treatment. Mortality was high among hospitalized patients with substance misuse, and chronic conditions were the top recorded causes of death. With less than 10% of deaths attributable to overdose, more focus is needed to prevent hospitalizations for physical ailments related to substance use. Further, our multimodal approach to capturing death data enriched the capture of fatal events and highlighted important disparities between data sources. The higher ADI in the state vital records of deaths not found in the EHR likely represent the uninsured and impoverished population, which are major risk factors for substance misuse.<xref rid="ooad092-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> The use of obituary feeds also helped identify out-of-state deaths not routinely recorded by state Vital Statistics.</p><p>Our open multiuser data user agreement was designed to foster new research on a sensitive population. The data science service capabilities within our secure cloud infrastructure enable data analytics and machine learning to be conducted by researchers. We are acquiring data from the Department of Corrections (the data use agreement is complete), bringing important criminal justice information to our population. Additionally, our hospital has built a high-throughput pipeline to convert all clinical documents into standardized medical vocabularies for creating deidentified features from text within all clinical notes and imaging reports for each hospitalization.<xref rid="ooad092-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooad092-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> The availability of text-based features further expands the utility of the SMDC for cohort identification.<xref rid="ooad092-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36&#8211;39</sup></xref></p><p>Our efforts in creating the SMDC have several limitations. First, the SMDC only contains information from one health system. Expanding to other urban and rural regional health systems will increase the size and diversity of our patient population. Second, all data sources do not contribute data for the same period. For example, the EHR data covers the years 2008-2022, whereas the ambulance data begins in 2016. However, substance misuse rates tend to depend on more recent longitudinal trends in predictors and thus have a short time lag. Finally, while more comprehensive than any existing data repository, the SMDC is missing data elements, such as medical examiner data and toxicology reports, or is limited to available information within each data source, such as medical and pharmacy insurance payors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The SMDC is a comprehensive data resource that combines data from hospitals, public health agencies, and first responder agencies, allowing for better identification and prioritization of care for Wisconsin&#8217;s most vulnerable residents.
