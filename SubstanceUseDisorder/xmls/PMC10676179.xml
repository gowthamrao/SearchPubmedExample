A low dose of lidocaine was administered to alleviate the pain of the procedure. In addition, the clinical outcome of age- and gender-matched patients randomly selected from patients who received mechanical needling with sterile water was compared to the patients injected with lidocaine, as the control standard treatment, in a 1:1 ratio.

</sup> In 4228 patients, mechanical needling was used to scrape off the calcification and fibrosis, and sterile water injection induced substantially more breakdown. There were statistically significantly reductions in back pain or axial pain, and leg pain or radicular pain immediately after needling and sterile water injection at 1month post-injection, 3&#160;months post-injection, and 6&#160;months post-injection compared to pre-injection or at baseline (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05). There were statistically significantly reduction of back pain or axial pain, leg pain or radicular pain, and improvement in walking distance at 3&#160;months and 6&#160;months in 100 patients who received mechanical needling with sterile water compared to the 100 patients who received lidocaine. In the lidocaine group, the back and leg pain returned at 3&#160;months and 6&#160;months post-injection. No needling was used to scrape off the calcification or fibrosis; only lidocaine was injected at the facet joint, medial branch, and multifidus. We found that mechanical needling with sterile water was useful in reducing axial and radicular pain for at least 6 months. Immediately after injection, 1&#160;week, and at 1&#160;month post-injection, the efficacy of mechanical needling with sterile water was comparable to lidocaine.</p><p>Since the large amount of liquid generated pressure at the facet joints, medial branches, and multifidus muscles, 40% of those who received mechanical needling with sterile water and 39% of those who received lidocaine had back discomfort. However, within 1&#8211;2&#160;days, the liquids in the interstitial tissues dissolved and return to the blood vessel. The gliding of the facet joints and muscles considerably improved after calcification and fibrosis were eliminated from the facet joints and muscles in 95% of patients who underwent mechanical needling with sterile water and 26% of those who received lidocaine. This could be attributed to the revascularization of the facet joints and nerve regeneration. The function of the blood vessels at the joint, nerves, and muscles is improved since there is less calcification or fibrosis blockage. Additional research, however, is needed to validate this. Dizziness was 65% in the lidocaine group immediately after injection and relief within 1&#8211;2&#160;hours of injection, compared to 6% in the mechanical needling with sterile water group. Mechanical needling with sterile water injection resulted in a 96% reduction in back stiffness after 1&#160;week through 6&#160;months, compared to 26% in the lidocaine group. Back stiffness was reduced as calcification and fibrosis surrounding the facet joints, nerves, and multifidus muscles were eliminated, allowing the facet joints to move more freely and improving the contract-relax characteristics of the muscles. Mechanical needling with sterile water injection had both mechanical disruption and a water jet effect, while lidocaine injection had only a water jet effect. It is a possible solution effect of sterile water. Sterile water molecules are rapidly distributed in the total body water, resulting in less hypervolemia.<sup>

</sup> The acidic effect of lidocaine might cause periarticular soft tissue inflammation led to fibrosis, inhibit osteoblast function. Acidosis has a direct impact on bone cells as well. In vitro, small pH reductions within the pathophysiological range result in substantial increases in osteoclast resorptive activity.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> In primary cultures of osteoblasts, acidosis (pH 6.9) also suppresses the production of mineralized bone nodules. Part of this inhibition can be due to the physicochemical dissolution of hydroxyapatite<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup>; nevertheless, in acidic circumstances, osteoblast expression and activity of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase is also dramatically reduced.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Facet joint injections (FJI) have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of LSS because they provide direct access to the facet joints via the paraspinal muscles and have fewer side effects than intraspinal injections.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="bibr27-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> There were some variation in intra-articular FJI practices. Early trials failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of the active substance over a placebo of normal saline, resulting in a lack of evidence to support the use of intra-articular FJI in guidelines. However, intra-articular FJI use in real-world practices is increasing. Despite a lack of evidence that local anesthesia or corticosteroids have a greater benefit than normal saline in intra-articular FJI, the trials used a combination of corticosteroid and local anesthesia<sup>
<xref rid="bibr28-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

<xref rid="bibr4-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> as a comparator of a novel injected substance such as HA or autologous PRP rather than normal saline as a control group. From these findings, it might be assumed that intra-articular FJI with any solution could improve axial and radicular pain in spinal stenosis. However, injecting the facet joint successfully, especially in the elderly, might be challenging because of spurs and cartilaginous metaplasia.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="bibr18-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The blocking of medial branch of facet joint was increasing popular since the less satisfaction of FJI in spinal stenosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="bibr14-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="bibr31-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> However, the outcome was still debate.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="bibr14-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="bibr31-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Mechanical needling was employed to scrape away the calcification and fibrosis, and sterile water injection resulted in significantly more disintegration, as well as changes in the neurochemistry of deeper tissue structures,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="bibr37-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> possibly improving the analgesic effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="bibr37-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Mechanical needling may diminish both peripheral and central sensitization by reducing the source of peripheral nociception, such as the trigger point (TrP) region, facet joint calcification, and fibrosis, modifying spinal dorsal horn activity, and activating the central inhibitory pain pathway. When a needle is inserted into the body, it causes a variety of natural neurophysiological responses, including stimulation of the A and C fibers and activation of cortical brain areas.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="bibr37-21925682221094533" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The water jet procedure can help eliminate calcification and fibrosis from the facet joint, nerves, and muscles by using sterile water. The procedure&#8217;s efficacy was seen to last up to 6 months in this investigation. Because it could reduce the source of mobility restriction, inflammation, pain, and neurovascular compression, mechanical needling with sterile water injection was more successful and produced faster results than lidocaine injection. Walking distance was also increased as a result of the outcomes. The cause is often considered to be nerve compression in the spinal canal. The treatment in this study mechanically alleviated this compression, which should result in joint vasculature and nerve regeneration after calcification and fibrosis removal. The mechanical needling with sterile water is cost-effective, chemical-free, and does not necessitate the use of several medical facilities. Any pharmacological injection, on the other hand, could be utilized subsequently to help with joint regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="sec16-21925682221094533"><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The study&#8217;s strengths were the large sample size and the fact that it evaluated the clinical outcomes after USG mechanical needling with sterile water injection at six distinct time points. Second, in this trial, a fraction of randomized participants were age and gender matched to the lidocaine group in a ratio of 1:1. However, this is a retrospective data analysis study with only one injector and one institution involved. Third, the benefits should not be due to the placebo effect because all patients were informed that the procedures they received were the treatments of choice for spinal stenosis.</p><p>Additional prospective RCT studies should be conducted in an international, multi-center setting with a large sample size to assess sensitization through quantitative sensory testing and ultrasonography to detect hyperechoic areas such as dense connective tissue, fibrosis, and calcification at baseline, during, and after treatment completion, with a longer follow-up period. More research is needed to confirm if greater facet joint gliding following calcification and fibrosis removal leads to joint revascularization and nerve regeneration. In addition, the randomization into three groups as dry mechanical needling, mechanical needling with sterile water injection, and lidocaine injection could be done for biochemical analysis of lidocaine and sterile water on periarticular tissues and for physical and anatomical analysis of mechanical needling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec17-21925682221094533"><title>Conclusions</title><p>USG mechanical needling with sterile water injections at the lumbar facet joints, medial branch of the facet joint, and multifidus muscles can alleviate pain for at least 6&#160;months.

Because no chemicals or pharmaceuticals are used, the method is both affordable and extremely safe.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the data analysts and research management team at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand who were pivotal in curating and linking the data to inform the analysis presented.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-by"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> All authors, Areerat Suputtitada, Carl PC Chen and Krit Pongpirul, have read and approved the final version of the manuscript.
