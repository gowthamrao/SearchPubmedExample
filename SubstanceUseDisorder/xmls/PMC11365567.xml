Among those without cirrhosis at baseline, patients were further stratified by status of progression to cirrhosis during follow-up. Total HCRU and costs per-person per-year (PPPY) were estimated and compared descriptively between the cohorts. In addition, gamma generalized linear models were used to compare costs PPPY between those with vs without cirrhosis at baseline, as well as with vs without progression during follow-up, while adjusting for baseline patient and disease characteristics. Annual costs per person were also longitudinally modeled using gamma generalized linear mixed models to understand longitudinal changes in costs PPPY while accounting for time correlations within individual patients. Lastly, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of study design features and clinical variations of total costs PPPY.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A total of 28,576 adults were included, and 9,157 (32.0%) had baseline cirrhosis; of the 19,419 without baseline cirrhosis, a total of 4,235 (21.8%) progressed over follow-up. Mean (SD) HCRU and costs PPPY were higher among patients with cirrhosis ($110,403 [$226,037]) than without ($28,340 [$61,472]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and among those with progression ($58,128 [$102,626]) than without ($20,031 [$39,740]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Costs remained significantly greater when adjusted for covariates, with a risk ratio (95% CI) of 1.99 (1.89-2.09) when comparing with vs without baseline cirrhosis and 2.28 (2.15-2.42) when comparing with vs without progression over follow-up. Costs increased with each subsequent year, to 21% by year 6 among those with cirrhosis at baseline and 49% among those without baseline cirrhosis who progressed.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>The financial burden of MASH is substantial and significantly greater among those with cirrhosis or disease progression. Although patients without cirrhosis incur lower burden, the increase over time is greater and associated with progression. Therapies that slow progression may help alleviate the financial burden, and strategies are needed to identify patients with MASH at risk of progressing to cirrhosis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>Plain language summary</title><p>This is a study of how expensive a liver disease called metabolic dysfunction&#8211;associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is in the United States. Using data from 28,576 adults with MASH, patients were grouped according to whether they had cirrhosis at the start of the study and whether they developed cirrhosis during the study. On average, costs were higher among adults with cirrhosis. Those who developed cirrhosis during the study also had higher costs than those who did not.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Implications for managed care pharmacy</title><p>This study of adults with MASH found that costs over the study period were higher for those with cirrhosis than without and higher when more severe liver issues developed. Given the magnitude of health care resource use and costs reported, in the context of increasing prevalence of MASH, strategies that slow or stop progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease may help alleviate the financial burden of managing MASH in the United States in the long term.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Drs Fishman and Kim are employees of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
