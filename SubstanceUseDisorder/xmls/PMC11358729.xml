Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health problem, and there are concerns regarding the relationship between inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and AMR (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In Japan, AMR has increased the disease burden (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and led to the loss of many lives (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Japan has traditionally had fewer infectious disease specialists than other countries; therefore, a small number of specialized teams have worked efficiently as infection control teams (ICTs) and antimicrobial stewardship teams (ASTs) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although there are approximately 800 institutions in Japan with infectious disease specialists, there are only 1 or no clinical infectious disease specialists in service (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospitals to make drastic changes in infection control measures and logistics, resulting in an excessive burden on ICTs and ASTs, and some medical facilities have had to limit their AST activities. The significance of maintaining sustainability in an antimicrobial stewardship program was established in a previous study (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). When the program's activity decreased, antimicrobial usage returned to its previous level. In addition, the workload of each department and medical staff continues to increase physically and psychologically as they deal with outpatient fever outbreaks, specimen collection, polymerase chain reaction testing, and the donning of personal protective equipment. Therefore, the promotion of antimicrobial stewardship programs during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging. However, there is limited information regarding antimicrobial stewardship programs at the facility level during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The present study assessed the broad-spectrum antimicrobial use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in an acute tertiary-care hospital in Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-center retrospective study was conducted at the Itabashi Chuo Medical Centre (ICHC), which is a 569-bed tertiary community-based acute care teaching hospital and teaching center with 34 subspecialties and a 12-bed intensive-care unit in Tokyo, Japan. The number of ambulance transports per year is approximately 10,000.</p><p>Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Japan on April 7, 2020. We compared intravenous inpatient antimicrobial consumption between the pre-pandemic (January 2019 to March 2020) and pandemic periods (April 2020 to June 2021).</p><p>A multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship program was conducted by 3 physicians (specializing in respiratory medicine, pediatrics, and nephrology, at a full-time equivalent of 0.1), a clinical pharmacist (full-time equivalent of 1.0), a microbiology laboratory technician (full-time equivalent of 0.1), an infection control nurse (full-time equivalent of 0.1), and a part-time infectious disease physician (full-time equivalent of 0.1). AST members held a 1.5-h case conference once a week. The target patients for the conference were as follows: patients treated with broad-spectrum anti-pseudomonal agents (carbapenem, tazobactam/piperacillin, and cefepime), intravenous quinolones for over seven days, and patients with positive blood cultures. Post-prescription review and feedback (PPRF) involves the process of case extraction carried out by AST pharmacists. After reviewing the medical information in the electronic health record, if necessary, an AST pharmacist (or physician) provided feedback to the prescribing physician via telephone or face-to-face discussion. The monthly aggregated hospital antimicrobial consumption was measured as days of therapy (DOTs) per 1,000 patient-days for broad-spectrum agents. The monthly antibiotic DOTs were measured between January 2019 and June 2021. During this period, AST conferences and activities were held, without any changes.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Itabashi Chuo Medical Center (No. 220125 B) and was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study only used data collected during clinical practice; therefore, the requirement for informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective design of the study.</p><sec><title>Definition</title><p>The total DOTs per month per 1,000 patient-days were calculated for carbapenem and 3 antipseudomonal agents: carbapenem (meropenem), tazobactam/piperacillin, and cefepime. Only meropenem was evaluated, as its consumption was &gt;98% of that of all carbapenems during this period. We measured the changes in carbapenem, tazobactam/piperacillin, and cefepime DOTs per 1,000 patient-days per month.</p><p>The incidence of <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI), multidrug-resistant<italic toggle="yes"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MRPA), and carbapenemase-producing <italic toggle="yes">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (CPE) per 1,000 patient-days was measured between January 2019 and June 2021.

The incidence of CDI per 1,000 patient-days showed no marked change over time, but there were significant differences in trends. A downward trend was observed in the monthly incidence of CDI per 1,000 patient-days during the COVID-19 period. There were no significant differences between the periods with respect to the incidences of MRPA and CPE.</p><p>Another study at a tertiary-care hospital in Japan described the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, such as carbapenem; in that study, the use of vancomycin remained relatively stable between the periods, presumably because of the pre-existing AST at the study center (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, antimicrobial use in the inpatient setting decreased despite a peak in the overall use of antimicrobials, especially third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin are the main treatment options for community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the increasing COVID-19 incidence, physicians may refrain from administering empiric therapy at admission. Concurrent infectious diseases rarely but occasionally occur despite infrequent use of antibiotics during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19, most of whom have a non-severe condition (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> is the causative organism of antibiotic-associated colitis, which is the most common infectious cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Effective infection control and appropriate antibiotic use through stewardship programs are crucial for reducing the incidence of CDI in healthcare settings (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). One possible explanation for the decreasing trend in the incidence of CDI during the COVID-19 pandemic is that appropriate measures have been implemented to prevent contact infections. Furthermore, an increase in hand hygiene compliance may be a contributing factor. Another possible explanation, as in previous studies, is that there may have been no marked change in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, although the overall use of antibiotics may have decreased (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the relevance of hypothesis in the current study remains unclear. Further investigations will be necessary to confirm this association.</p><p>In the present study, the incidence of CDI decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic, but no marked changes in the incidence of MRPA and CPE were found. The exact reason for this is unclear, it is possible that CDI demonstrates a more rapid reduction effect in response to rigorously implemented infection control measures, compared to MRPA and CPE. Further research on this topic is required.</p><p>A previous study showed an increased use of antimicrobials in patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization during the pandemic in the United States (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In our study and a previous study performed in Japan (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), despite an increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases, the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials (e.g. carbapenems) remained relatively stable during both periods. These results suggest that pre-existing active ASTs may help maintain broad-spectrum antimicrobial use in Japan. Maintaining AST activity during the COVID-19 pandemic is important from the perspective of antimicrobial stewardship.</p><p>This study had several limitations related to its retrospective and uncontrolled nature. First, it was conducted at a single center with retrospective data collection and a relatively short follow-up period. Thus, the study findings may not be generalizable to other settings. Second, although an interrupted time series analysis was performed in this study, the monthly broad-spectrum antibiotic DOT/1,000 patients were evaluated using a pre-post analysis. Accurately adjusting for confounding factors during pre/post analyses can be challenging, especially when considering such factors as the passage of time and various patient characteristics. Third, only broad-spectrum antibiotics were evaluated in this study, limiting the antibiotic type analyzed. Several aspects warrant further investigations, such as differences among medical specialties in terms of antibiotic usage as well as the appropriateness of broad-spectrum antibiotic usage for individual COVID-19 cases, considering factors such as disease severity and the presence of concurrent bacterial infections. Finally, the results of this study may change depending on the number of patients with COVID-19 and the severity of the disease in the hospital. In the present study, the maximum average number of COVID-19 hospitalization patients was 9.5%. The impact of antimicrobial prescriptions on patients with COVID-19 and hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19 during the pandemic needs to be considered (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A future multicenter study should be conducted to elucidate the antimicrobial consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the consumption of broad intravenous antimicrobial agents did not change significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic in an acute tertiary-care hospital in Japan. Despite the increased strain during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in acute-care hospitals has been maintained. The medical burden of COVID-19 will continue; however, we must maintain the quality of medical care, including antimicrobial stewardship, in healthcare settings, even in specialist resource-limited facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><p>
