at home, that is, to remain indoors and minimise contact with others.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> To identify CEV people, a shielded patient list (SPL) was created, using an algorithm based on clinical code lists and applied centrally to patients&#8217; electronic health records.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Additionally, health professionals could add people to the list based on their clinical judgement. Shielding was in place from 23 March 2020 to 16 August 2020 and reintroduced from 22 December 2020 to 1 April 2021.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> CEV children were encouraged to return to school at the end of August 2020 taking into account the low rate of severe disease and death from COVID-19 among children, balanced against the harms of a lack of schooling and socialisation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Studies have highlighted the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of CEV adults, with CEV individuals more likely to report increased depressive symptoms and anxiety<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and to have a clinical record of anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with those who were not CEV.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Meanwhile, studies have reported decreased diagnoses of mental health conditions in primary care across the population as a whole during the pandemic<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> (attributed to a reluctance to seek healthcare, or reduced access to services, rather than a decrease in need). However, there is limited evidence on how children accessed healthcare during the pandemic for their mental health, and no studies focusing on CEV children or children living with a CEV person.</p><p>Children are particularly vulnerable to indirect impacts of the pandemic.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Drawing on evidence from longitudinal surveys,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;10</xref> the department for education concluded that children&#8217;s mental health declined during the pandemic, reporting that rates of probable mental health disorders were higher from 2020 than before.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The data also highlighted variation in mental health trajectories; children with long-term health conditions were more likely to experience poor mental health during the pandemic.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the extent to which these trends are attributable to the pandemic, or are a continuation of pre-existing upward trends, is unclear.</p><p>Almost 5000 CEV children were living in Wales by July 2020; approximately 3.9% of the Welsh CEV population.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Children with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of behavioural and emotional problems and psychiatric disorders compared with their peers,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> but CEV children may be particularly susceptible to mental health difficulties relative to non-CEV children since the pandemic, due to additional restrictions imposed by shielding guidance, potentially exacerbating loneliness and isolation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> CEV children may have also experienced heightened health anxiety due to their potential higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Additionally, there were almost 14&#8201;400 school-aged children living with a CEV person in June 2020<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> who may be at greater risk of mental health difficulties due to both restrictions to protect the vulnerable members of their household, and fears of causing harm.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on use of healthcare services for anxiety or depression in Wales, for CEV children, children living with a CEV person and children in the general population, using routinely collected population-level linked data. The primary aim was to determine whether CEV children or children living with a CEV person were more likely to have a record for anxiety or depression in primary or secondary care during the pandemic compared with children in the general population. The secondary aim was to compare patterns of anxiety or depression in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 between CEV children and the general population, to place the impact of COVID-19 and the shielding guidance in the context of longer-term patterns of healthcare use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and data sources</title><p>This is a population-based cross-sectional cohort study using anonymised, linked, routinely collected health and administrative data for the population of Wales, UK, held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="www.saildatabank.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.saildatabank.com</ext-link>).

Creation of this prepandemic cohort enabled us to explore whether adverse mental health outcomes for CEV children during the pandemic were likely attributable to the shielding guidance, or whether CEV children experience poorer mental health compared with the general population regardless of having to shield. We included children who were alive, living in Wales and registered with an SAIL-supplying GP 1&#8201;year prior to the introduction of shielding (23 March 2019) and who had one or more of three of the health condition categories warranting inclusion on the SPL (respiratory illnesses, blood or bone cancer, and immunosuppression therapy). These categories were chosen as they only required the patient to have one of the listed codes within a given time period, and therefore children with these conditions could be identified with a high degree of certainty. We used International Classification of Diseases (ICD) V.10 diagnostic codes and Operating Procedures Codes Supplement (OPCS) Classification of Interventions and Procedures V.4 codes for these categories, which were taken from the SPL documentation and provided in the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix pp 4&#8211;5</xref> . For comparison purposes, we also created a general population cohort of children aged 2&#8211;17 who were alive, living in Wales and registered with an SAIL-supplying GP as of 23 March 2019.

Read codes are a hierarchical terminology system that encode clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic patient information and enable data entry of patient care information following a primary care consultation. Separate Read codes are used to record a patients&#8217; reported past medical history, or to note that a clinician is aware of a past condition. We used ICD-10 diagnostic codes to identify children with hospital admissions or outpatient appointments for anxiety or depression in the Patient Episode Database for Wales and outpatient dataset datasets.

For CEV children, this pattern remained evident after adjusting for demographic differences and the likelihood of having a previous history of anxiety or depression. Although a small increase in risk was found for children living with a CEV person, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and previous history of anxiety and depression, this was no longer significant.</p><p>Both before and during the pandemic, the groups with the greatest risk of having a record for anxiety or depression were adolescents aged 13&#8211;17, and those with both a past and recent history of anxiety or depression. Females were also more likely than males to have a record for anxiety or depression in both time periods. These findings are in line with previous studies reporting worse mental health in female adolescents compared with male adolescents<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression in adolescents and females compared with younger children and males during the pandemic<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; and worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic for those with pre-existing mental health difficulties.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This suggests that moving forward, it will be important to prioritise mental health support for female adolescents, and particularly for children who have concomitant physical and mental health conditions.</p><p>Given the detailed methodology used to identify CEV individuals in Wales,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> we were able to develop a comparable cohort of children with a subset of health conditions before the pandemic, using routine healthcare data. This enabled us to examine patterns of presentation for anxiety and depression among CEV children outside of the context of the pandemic. We found this group were at greater risk of having a record for anxiety or depression compared with children in the general population in 2019/2020, before COVID-19. In 2020/2021, CEV children remained at higher risk, and the difference was greater, although this is explained by a marked decline among children in the general population presenting to healthcare services with anxiety or depression during this time.</p><p>The reduction in presentations for anxiety and depression among children in the general population most likely reflects reduced access to NHS services during the pandemic. Other evidence suggests increased demand and unmet need for mental health support in the UK, for children with and without pre-existing mental health problems, since 2020.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Findings from self-report surveys<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;10</xref> and the current study suggest that the pandemic has widened the gap between need and access to mental healthcare for the general population of children in Wales, but additional data are required to unpack the relationship between self-reported mental health needs and presentation to healthcare services.</p><p>Meanwhile, the relatively stable period prevalence of anxiety and depression for CEV children in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 could indicate that this group did not experience an increase in mental health needs during the pandemic over and above past years, and that they had access to mental health support through existing care pathways for underlying conditions. Alternatively, if CEV children experienced the same increase in mental health needs as reported elsewhere among the general population, then these figures may mask unmet demand for mental health support among this group. A survey of adults supports the latter explanation, reporting increased anxiety and depressive symptoms among shielding individuals compared with non-shielding individuals.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, we have found no UK surveys focusing on the mental health of CEV children.</p><p>Our finding that children living with a CEV person were at no greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with the general population (after controlling for other factors), could be interpreted in two ways. It is possible that the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children living with a CEV person was not as great as for CEV children, but this seems unlikely given that research has suggested increased anxiety among children who were shielding their siblings.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another explanation is that children living with a CEV person suffered from similar barriers to access to mental healthcare services to the general population and did not have the same routes to access that CEV children did. This explanation is supported by research with shielding families, which suggests that they have felt left behind and that children living with a CEV person may have &#8216;fallen under the radar of educational and healthcare professionals&#8217;.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study examining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare use for anxiety or depression among CEV children and children living with a CEV person in Wales. Linkage of population-based routinely collected data is a valuable method for generating evidence with a high level of external validity and applicability for policy-making. A strength of this study is the comparison of 2020/2021 data with prepandemic 2019/2020 data for CEV children and children in the general population. Another strength is the use of a novel approach using multiple linked datasets to identify a cohort of children living with a CEV person during the pandemic.</p><p>This study used the SPL to create cohorts of children identified as CEV and a cohort of children living with a CEV person. There was heterogeneity within the SPL in terms of the type and severity of individuals&#8217; underlying conditions; the manner in which people were added to the list (via the algorithm or clinical judgement); the time point that people were added to the list; and the extent to which people followed the shielding guidance. In addition, the impact of following shielding guidance is likely to have varied due to individual circumstances and the level of support received. The 2019 &#8216;CEV&#8217; cohort was a relatively small sample and for pragmatic reasons, only included children with a subset of the conditions included in the shielding guidance. To identify children living with a CEV person, we adopted a conservative approach and included children only if they were living with their mother. We took this approach in order to minimise bias and increase the generalisability of the findings; however, this approach is likely to have underestimated the number of children living with a CEV person. Finally, this study focused on healthcare use using clinical codes. Routinely collected healthcare data does not capture self-reported health, and is likely to underestimate the burden of common mental disorders in the population.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Focusing on healthcare use with routine data alone cannot tell us about the underlying reasons for changes in utilisation, or the scale of mental health need.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p>Our findings have implications for recovery planning to prevent, mitigate and respond to the mental health impacts of the pandemic. We have shown changes in presentation to primary and secondary healthcare services with anxiety and depression for CEV children and children in the general population during the pandemic, and there are concerns regarding potential increases in unmet mental health needs over time. As highlighted by UK organisations, such as the Centre for Mental Health,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> services face challenges in tackling this demand. This has been recognised by Welsh Government, who invested an additional &#163;9.4 million in children&#8217;s mental health services in 2021.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>This novel linked data study contributes to our understanding of the direct and indirect impact of shielding on children&#8217;s mental health in Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. This evidence should be considered in light of additional, more detailed routine healthcare linkage studies, and national surveys, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between mental health support needs, expressed demands and care provision to better target services to those who need them the most.</p><p>Beyond the indirect impacts of the pandemic, our findings highlight the increased mental health needs of children with serious medical conditions. Given that these children are likely to have greater contact with healthcare services, signposting across services, including mental health services, is likely to be beneficial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e201" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-067882.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e202" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
