(DoD)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> or &#8216;deaths of despair&#8217;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8212;that is, morbidity and mortality resulting from drug abuse, alcoholism and suicidality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4 5</xref> While DoD were initially found to disproportionately affect white males and females in midlife with low educational attainment in rural American regions beset by long-term labour market decline, in recent years excess mortality and morbidity has been found to be increasing across diverse demographic groups.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 6&#8211;12</xref> Researchers have theorised<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> that economic dislocation, which has disproportionately affected those lacking college degrees in a postindustrial service- and knowledge-based economy over recent decades,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> has progressively weakened family structures, limited access to high-quality healthcare, reduced participation in social organisations and caused loneliness, isolation and loss of future-oriented hope.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 16 17</xref> Consequently, these phenomena may trigger biopsychosocial changes (eg, chronic pain, anxiety, depression), increasing the likelihood of self-harm and substance-use illnesses.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the DoD crisis. In 2020, 186&#8201;763 DoD-related deaths occurred in the USA&#8212;the highest in the last 30 years.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Another important contributor to premature death and reduced life expectancy is largely preventable cardiometabolic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes. While mortality from these conditions had largely declined through much of the 20th century, progress has stalled in more recent decades consistent with the rise of DoD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 19</xref> In fact, if the declining trends in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) had continued beyond 2010, prevented cardiac deaths would account for a larger share of excess mortality than the additional deaths attributable to rising DoD.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It has been argued that ASCVD as well as obesity should be considered a constituent part of the DoD phenomenon, as both groups of illnesses appear to be highly sensitive to economic hardship and biopsychosocial stress.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similar findings have been observed in other countries during and following economic hardship. Indeed, researchers have previously noted<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> a substantial rise in mortality from DoD (suicide, alcohol and illicit drug consumption) and cardiometabolic disorders in Russia. In the 1990s, economic shocks following the fall of the Soviet Union (ie, collapse of state services, loss of pensions and healthcare access, rapid privatisation, rise of monopolies, etc) led to 7.3&#8201;million excess deaths and a dramatic loss of 6&#8201;years in mean life expectancy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There is, however, a need to compare these prior findings from Russia to contemporary populations from the USA who have been subject to overlapping but different socioeconomic factors.</p><p>There are several potential indirect and direct causal links between DoD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consequences of despair can include behavioural inaction, or risky and unhealthy acts that reflect limited consideration of the future and negatively affect cardiometabolic health (eg, smoking, poor dietary habits, low physical activity). Biologically, despair can appear in individual stress-related physiological markers and in accumulated allostatic load, which includes various downstream physiological consequences related to cardiovascular health (eg, obesity, hypertension, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#8211;26</xref> Despair can also be inferred from changes in body functions like sleep, appetite, concentration and pain,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which may reciprocally fuel both behavioural and biological risks.</p><p>Another important consideration in this framework is the potential for differences among the component conditions that comprise DoD and differences in the degree and nature of their respective impacts on ASCVD. Recent research findings challenge the use of &#8216;despair&#8217; as a single composite measure, and suggest distinct dimensions of despair that relate to specific health behaviours and outcomes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Better understanding these associations and the biopsychosocial mechanisms linking both overall despair and its individual condition components to adverse cardiovascular outcomes is critical for developing appropriate surveillance, prevention and intervention strategies. This information could save many lives and have important public health implications including decreased morbidity and reduced healthcare costs.</p><p>We used a large national insurance claims database to investigate the association between overall DoD and the conditions comprising it during a baseline period and the subsequent incidence of ASCVD outcomes over a 5-year follow-up period. While the cohort includes individuals from across the USA, the cohort is most densely concentrated in the Appalachian region and states disproportionately affected by DoD, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Research design and population</title><p>The analytic cohort included adults insured through Highmark Health across the USA.

Overall exposure was defined as presence of ICD-10 codes in any position for substance-related disorders, alcohol-related disorders or suicidality/intentional self-harm. These classifications were drawn from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Clinical Classification Software.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Diagnoses related to substance use considered outside the focus of the present study were excluded, specifically, codes related to the use of tobacco and cannabis, and certain non-psychoactive substances (ie, ICD-10 codes F550, F551, F552, F554). In addition to the composite measure of DoD, a categorical indicator was created by capturing the potential combinations of substance-related disorders, alcohol-related disorders and suicidality/intentional self-harm. The reference level for this indicator was set to &#8216;None&#8217;, that is, no substance, alcohol or suicidality diagnoses recorded.</p><p>All covariates were based on the baseline year and included sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, personal medical history and healthcare utilisation. All were sourced from publicly available census data, claims history or The Johns Hopkins ACG System, a well-established and robust software tool that provides a flexible multimorbidity framework that includes validated claims-based indicators for clinical conditions, utilisation and quality of care.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Sociodemographic characteristics included age and sex at the individual level as recorded in claims at baseline. Area-level social determinants of health (SDOH) characteristics were appended using geographic joining keys based on geocoding of the residential addresses that covered the longest portion of the baseline year. SDOH information included several different census tract-level measures. Rurality designations were based on census tract-level rural&#8211;urban commuting area codes. Social Vulnerability Index was extracted from the CDC&#8217;s 2016 estimates.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Gini Index, a measure of area level income inequality, was pulled from the RAND state statistics database for 2016 and linked to the cohort using census tract to zip code tabulation area mapping.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> All other SDOH covariates, poverty, educational attainment, vehicle access and marital status were drawn from the Census Bureau&#8217;s American Community Survey 2016 5-year estimates.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Individual smoking status and obesity were assigned based on the presence of at least one relevant ICD-10 code in any position on any baseline year claims. Frailty was based on classifications from the ACG system and identifies individuals within diagnostic clusters associated with frailty (eg, malnutrition, dementia, incontinence, difficulty in walking).</p><p>We used classifications from the ACG system to derive healthcare cost and utilisation measures. A psychotherapy service indicator identified those with at least two ambulatory psychotherapy services within 120 days during the observation period. Inpatient count reflected the total number of unique admissions unrelated to childbirth or injury. Outpatient count was defined as the total count of unique ambulatory and hospital outpatient visits. Total cost was defined as the medical plus pharmacy total cost of care during the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline characteristics were compared by exposure and censoring within each cohort. Because p values offer little information on the magnitude of effects in large population-level datasets, standardised mean differences were used to assess differences. While there is no clear consensus on the effect size denoting a meaningful difference, the commonly used rule of thumb is 10%.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref></p><p>Initial univariate proportional hazard models were computed against the main effect and each independent variable to understand the matrix of relationships between all the covariates and the outcome. Then, an iterative multivariate modelling process was conducted adding and removing covariates to both find the model of best fit and to understand how fitting different covariates impacted the working mechanism. We hypothesised potential effect modification by age, medical risk factors or SDOH. Several interaction terms were tested. Terms that did not meet the threshold of statistical significance or improve model fit were removed.</p><p>Following initial modelling, we posited potential bias from those individuals with greater engagement with the health system. To test for this bias, we removed individuals with cost or utilisation among the top 5% and reran the final model on the reduced sample.

This effect was found both for DoD as a composite measure, and for each of the separate components of DoD. While all components conferred risk for ASCVD, the magnitude of that relationship varied, with substance-related disorders having the strongest singular relationship with the outcome. Findings also suggested a potential dose&#8211;response relationship, where those with multiple exposures bear the most risk. Notably, the co-occurrence of suicidality with substance- or alcohol-related disorder conferred markedly higher ASCVD risk than substance- or alcohol-related disorders alone (aHR=2.01&#8201;and 1.65 with co-occurring suicidality; 1.50 and 1.33 for sole diagnosis).</p><p>The association between DoD and incident ASCVD was robust to a variety of tested confounders, and subgroup analyses demonstrated that it applied to both men and women across all age groups and was only slightly attenuated in older age as multimorbidity and associated competing risk factors became more prevalent. Although average age among those with a history of DoD was several years younger than those without, at baseline, this group had higher rates of smoking, obesity and frailty, more outpatient and inpatient encounters, and higher overall healthcare costs, suggesting the need for holistic approaches to intervention that address the complex biopsychosocial needs of this vulnerable population.</p><p>Studies linking cardiometabolic disease to all components of DoD are rare, as extant research has largely focused on CVD as it relates to the individual conditions that comprise DoD (suicidality, accidental poisoning and alcoholism). For example, excess deaths in Russia due to alcohol use, suicide and illicit drug use in coinciding with the socioeconomic crisis that followed the fall of the Soviet Union are well documented.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Notably, in middle-aged Russian men, death due to CVD increased in areas of high alcohol consumption versus those regions of lower alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In a case&#8211;control study of 48&#8201;557 adults deaths in Russia, alcohol contributed to more than half of deaths among those aged 15&#8211;54 years. In this study, consumption of alcohol was similarly associated with an increased risk of dying from ischaemic heart disease (relative risk 3.04, 95%&#8201;CI 2.73 to 3.39).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Another study among 17&#8201;642 Danish participants seeking outpatient treatment for drug use (mostly opioid use) from 2001 to 2006 found an increased risk of incident CVD after a mean follow-up of 7.5 years among those participants that used intravenous drugs sub-HR (SHR 1.41, 95%&#8201;CI 1.22 to 1.63), methadone (SHR 1.32, 95%&#8201;CI 1.15 to 1.51) and benzodiazepines (SHR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.38).<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Another study in 7641 adults in the USA aged 17&#8211;39 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that depression and history of a suicide attempt increased the risk of ischaemic heart disease death (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.32 to 10.35 and HR 7.12, 95% CI 2.67 to 18.98, respectively) after a median of 14.9 years of follow-up.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Our findings extend this work by examining the role of these three groups of conditions in ASCVD through the composite &#8216;despair&#8217; conceptual framework, and as separate conditions that may appear in isolation or combination.</p><p>There are strengths and limitations to this analysis that warrant discussion. Highmark&#8217;s insurance claims database has over 12&#8201;million members with longitudinal data spanning up to 15 years. Membership is concentrated in disproportionately DoD-affected regions including Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware. This database also includes healthcare utilisation variables such as cost, inpatient, outpatient and psychotherapy services, as well as area-level sociodemographic variables such as education, poverty and vehicle access.</p><p>This is an observational study and therefore uncontrolled confounders could be present. While the Highmark database is a rich source of information, we lack individual level SDOH metrics for previously established key predictors of despair related illness like educational attainment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, sensitivity analyses suggest that an unmeasured confounder would need to have an effect that is quite large in this study context (HR=2.18). Many potential confounders such as sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviours are interrelated, and a potential unmeasured confounder would need to be reach this effect size independent of all measured covariates in the fully adjusted model to negate the effect of DoD on ASCVD. Notably, the adjusted effects for area-level educational attainment and marriage rates were consistent with the framework posited by DoD, with higher levels of each significantly predicting lower risk for ASCVD.</p><p>A common limitation of administrative data in research is attrition due to insufficient surveillance data. Individuals with more precarious living situations may be disproportionately lost to follow-up due to disenrolment, which could cause risk factor magnitude and prevalence of associated adverse health outcomes to be underestimated. For this reason, we instituted right censoring rather than studying more restrictive fixed-length cohorts, which is a strength in our design. Relatedly, this population was made up individuals enrolled in health insurance, which suggests some degree of stability and is often used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. This is an important consideration for generalisability. Notably, our previous work suggests that although base rates of DoD vary by insurance coverage type, there is relative consistency in the relationship between DoD and other outcomes.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>ICD-10 codes were used as the method for adjudication of cardiometabolic events, DoD and clinical covariates. This method could be susceptible to bias. Obesity and tobacco use may not be reliably documented in insurance claims data, and these factors are likely under-reported in the study cohort.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Similarly, it is possible that existing ASCVD events could be recorded as incident events if they were not documented within our surveillance period, and clinical documentation does not necessarily reflect the true chronicity of disease development. Also, given that those with DoD have higher healthcare utilisation, this may have led to more opportunity for medical diagnoses. However, in sensitivity analyses removing the highest utilisers from the sample, conclusions remained consistent, suggesting that detection was not strongly influenced by very high utilisation.</p><p>The specific casual mechanisms linking DoD and cardiometabolic disease remain poorly established, and further work is needed in this area. It has been previously proposed that obesity is the main shared driver between DoD and cardiometabolic disease, as the same mechanisms at the neurotransmitter level in the brain that contribute to addiction of opioids and alcohol may contribute to unhealthy food addictions, all in the service of numbing pain/despair or making life more bearable.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, rates of obesity were only slightly higher among those with DoD in our study, and in multivariate models, DoD was independently associated with ASCVD after adjusting for clinically documented obesity. DoD may also increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases through depression, medication adherence and poor lifestyle choices.</p><p>From a policy perspective, it is necessary to ask what measures should be undertaken to reduce ASCVD in this high-risk population. The question remains regarding whether screening for ASCVD should be intensified with frequent cardiac risk assessments, lipid profiles, blood pressure assessments and measurements of haemoglobin A1C in populations at high risk of DoD given the robust association with an increased risk of ASCVD. Ideally, ASCVD prevention strategies in populations at risk of DoD should be tested in a randomised trial. Lastly, given the apparent role of economic dislocation and precariousness as a possible key determinant of risk for DoD and cardiometabolic disease, researchers could use big data approaches to examine long-term socioeconomic indicators and their correlation with disease patterns in regions affected by long- and short-term economic decline. Establishing the predictive value of such associations could help guide directed public health efforts to the neighbourhood level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Baseline diagnosis of DoD was associated with an increased risk of developing ASCVD. This increased risk of ASCVD was present for each of the individual components of DoD, with higher risk still in the presence of co-occurring component conditions, suggesting a dose&#8211;response relationship. Subgroup analysis showed that DoD is associated with increased risk of ASCVD in both men and women and across various age groups. Those with DoD are more likely to have increased healthcare costs and healthcare utilisation including outpatient, inpatient and psychotherapy services compared with those without DoD at baseline. Clinicians treating patients with DoD should be aware of the increased risk of ASCVD and encourage appropriate cardiovascular screening measures. It has been more recently argued that ASCVD (as well as obesity) should be considered a constituent part of the DoD phenomenon. These findings shed an important light on the intersection between DoD and CVD and may help establish an empirical basis for integrating ASCVD into future clinical and public health and policy approaches to the growing crisis of despair-related illnesses in the USA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e245" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2023-074102.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e246" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
