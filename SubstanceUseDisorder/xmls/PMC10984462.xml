Yet, patients with SUDs exhibit low rates of treatment utilization for both medical [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and addictive disorders [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the majority of people living with SUDs never utilize addiction services [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and frequently receive suboptimal medical care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As a result, improving access to medical and substance use treatment services is central to improving outcomes for this patient population.</p><p>Telehealth expansion may be one strategy to enhance health care utilization for patients with SUDs by reducing barriers to care, thereby creating an opportunity to reduce health disparities for this patient population. Common barriers to care for this population include affordability and availability of services, stigma, and prevalence of comorbid mental health disorders [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Telehealth can help overcome these barriers by simplifying treatment logistics, enhancing patient anonymity, and reducing the costs of seeking care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Telehealth may also represent an effective modality for treating patients with SUDs given mounting evidence that the core of SUD care&#8211;counseling and medication management&#8211;can be delivered via telehealth with at or near comparable outcomes to in-person care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yet, by requiring technology, internet and remote privacy, telehealth expansion could simultaneously deepen inequities for individuals with financial insecurity and homelessness, common among patients with SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given these competing forces, it is unclear whether telehealth expansion can increase health care utilization for this patient population. More evidence is needed for health systems considering how and whether to deepen their investment in telehealth capabilities for patients with SUDs.</p><p>Comparing telehealth uptake across different patient populations could demonstrate whether telehealth expansion offers a particular advantage for patients with SUDs. An appropriate comparison group would exhibit similar insurance coverage and socioeconomic need, duration of treatment, treatment settings used, and clinical appropriateness for remote care. Low-income patients with chronic medical disease frequently have high medical need and require ongoing evaluation like patients with SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, patients with type 2 diabetes offer a compelling comparison group. In contrast with management of cardiac, pulmonary, renal and hepatic disease, which is more substantially improved by in-person examination and laboratory data, much of the management of type 2 diabetes can occur remotely via collaborative retrospective evaluation of home glucose monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The impact of addiction on psychosocial functioning, including those behaviors involved in seeking and utilizing care, distinguishes patients with SUDs from those with diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result, examining utilization among patients with SUDs relative to patients with diabetes may reveal whether telehealth can increase treatment utilization specifically for patients with SUDs.</p><p>The rapid telehealth expansion prompted by the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) offers an opportunity to examine differences in telehealth uptake for patients with SUDs relative to diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While studies have reported on trends in telehealth use during the pandemic for patients with SUDs, comparative analyses remain rare. In addition, while studies have examined telehealth expansion in populations with Medicare and private insurance [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], fewer have described trends for low-income patient populations such as those with Medicaid [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, while studies have evaluated telehealth incorporation into subspecialty practice [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], mental health care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], emergency room services [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and hospital medicine [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], less work has focused on primary care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the central role of primary care in providing addiction and medical services to patients with SUDs and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], examining the impact of telehealth incorporation on primary care utilization holds particular relevance for reducing utilization disparities for patients with SUDs.</p><p>This study aimed to measure changes in utilization of in-person and telehealth primary care services for adult Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with SUDs during the rapid telehealth expansion period prompted by the COVID-19 PHE. To understand the degree to which changes in utilization are different for SUDs, we compare trends in treatment utilization for patients with SUDs with those from a cohort of Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data source</title><p>Study data are from Wisconsin Medicaid administrative, enrollment and claims data from December 2018 through December 2020. Claims were used to identify beneficiaries with an SUD or type 2 diabetes (herein, &#8220;diabetes&#8221;) diagnosis, as well as to identify the presence of a comorbid psychotic diagnosis. Enrollment data was used to obtain demographic characteristics of the two cohorts at baseline (June 2019) including eligibility category, age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, income and geography. In these data, race and ethnicity are usually obtained via self-identification but sometimes are reported by caseworkers.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Population</title><p>The study cohorts included nonpregnant, nondisabled, noninstitutionalized adults ages 19 to 64 years eligible for Wisconsin Medicaid as either parents/caretakers or childless adults (CLA). Individuals who turned 65 during the study period were excluded. We required continuous enrollment from June 2019 through December 2020. We elected to require continuous enrollment to 1) better isolate the effects of telehealth expansion on utilization and b) minimize bias due to compositional changes. Maintenance of eligibility (MOE) protections provided by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act prohibited Medicaid beneficiary disenrollment during the PHE and so more beneficiaries than typical were continuously enrolled [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Continuous enrollment, defined as an enrollment gap of no more than 1 month, identified 143,992 individuals. Among those continuously enrolled during the study period, we identified the SUD and diabetes cohorts as those with at least 1 claim with an SUD or diabetes diagnosis in the six months before the study period (December 2018 &#8211;May 2019) in the outpatient, inpatient or emergency department setting. Continuous enrollment was not required in this six-month prior period. Patients with both an SUD and diabetes diagnosis were retained in the SUD cohort only. Diagnoses were identified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. For SUD diagnoses, we included ICD-10 codes for alcohol, opioid, cannabis, sedative, stimulant, and other psychoactive substance use disorders (F10-F19). We excluded nicotine (F17) and miscellaneous SUDs (F550-F558: antacids, herbal remedies, laxatives, steroids, vitamins and other non-psychoactive substances). For diabetes, we included ICD-10 codes E1100-E118 and E119.

We identified primary care visits using a combination of provider specialty codes and rendering provider taxonomy to identify visits completed by a primary care provider and/or in a primary care location. We identified telehealth based on the procedure code, or the presence of either a place of service code or modifier indicating telehealth consistent with state guidelines for providers. Visits that addressed diabetes or a SUD, specifically, were identified via diagnosis claims in association with the office visit. For additional details see <xref rid="pone.0299397.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Appendix</xref>. Covariates included age, sex, race, ethnicity, income (as percentage of the federal poverty limit (FPL)), geography (residing in a rural or urban county or missing), presence of a comorbid chronic medical condition and presence of a comorbid psychotic disorder. In most cases, race and ethnicity data are obtained via self-identification, though occasionally reported by caseworkers. The presence of comorbid chronic medical or psychotic disorders was identified in the six months prior to study start via ICD-10 codes. Chronic medical conditions included asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, thyroid disorders, heart failure, chronic liver disease, and osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Chronic psychotic disorders included schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, other psychotic disorders and diagnoses with psychotic features.

Visit rates were estimated as proportion of the cohort with a visit at the person-week level (any modality and by telehealth, specifically). Analyses were repeated for disease-specific visits. We conducted logistic regression to test for differences between the SUD and diabetes cohorts in: 1) the change in probability of having a primary care visit in the week (any modality, any diagnosis) post-PHE (Model 1), and 2) the change in probability of having a primary care visit by telehealth (any diagnosis) post-PHE (Model 2). We conducted fractional regression to test for differences in the fraction of primary care visits that incorporated telehealth between the SUD and diabetes cohorts in the post period and clustered at the beneficiary level (Model 3). All models adjusted for key characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, FPL, geography, presence of a comorbid chronic medical condition and presence of a psychotic disorder.

id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a sample of continuously enrolled Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with SUDs or diabetes, we found that patients with SUDs were more likely to use telehealth than patients with diabetes during a period of rapid telehealth expansion at the beginning of the COVID-19 PHE. While patients with diabetes completed a greater proportion of visits via telehealth initially, over time, rates of telehealth utilization remained proportionately higher for patients with SUDs. In the background of this telehealth expansion, we found that patients with SUDs experienced a larger proportionate drop and slower recovery of primary care utilization post-PHE relative to patients with diabetes. Given the disruption observed in SUD primary care utilization, these findings suggest that telehealth played an outsized role in buoying primary care utilization among patients with SUDs compared with patients with diabetes. These findings parallel literature suggesting that remote care models offset in-person declines during the PHE to allow stable access to treatment for opioid use disorder [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Similar trends persisted for the SUD cohort when restricting analyses to visits for SUD diagnoses. In contrast, there was only a modest reduction in total visits in the pre- and post-PHE periods for the diabetes cohort when we restricted analyses to visits for a diabetes diagnosis. The clinical implications of these divergent findings are unclear since diagnosis codes do not indicate the content, quantity or quality of treatment. It may be that diseases like diabetes are more easily compartmentalized and thus not addressed at every visit, while SUDs have a more expansive impact on wellness and therefore appear at a higher proportion of visits. Alternatively, it may be that the stigma of substance use makes SUD diagnoses more notable and therefore documented more frequently by clinicians. Given low self-reported rates of SUD treatment receipt [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the prevalence of SUD diagnosis codes in primary care claims suggests that providers may identify addiction in the office more often than they provide treatment [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Our findings carry important health implications for patients with SUDs. Inadequate medical care for addictive and medical disorders results in increased mortality for patients with SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] alongside preventable medical expenditures [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Substantial evidence has demonstrated the health benefits of comprehensive primary care for chronic disease and preventive services [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], including for patients with SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As such, if telehealth expansion increases the likelihood of primary care utilization for patients with SUDs, telehealth may help reduce health disparities while lowering health care costs for these patients. Notably, additional strategies will be needed to bolster treatment engagement among patients with SUDs given the relatively modest, though statistically significant, advantage offered by telehealth for visit completion.</p><p>Despite telehealth&#8217;s potential advantages, we identify several reasons to remain cautious. First, it is unclear whether reducing utilization gaps via synchronous telehealth achieves the same outcomes as in-person visits for SUDs or medical disorders. Growing literature suggests diagnostic and treatment equivalence of in-person and telehealth modalities for mental health [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and adjunct telehealth services can improve outcomes in SUD care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, studies directly comparing synchronous telehealth and in-person care for addiction treatment are lacking [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, growing evidence suggests equivalent effectiveness in medical domains like anticoagulation management [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and acute care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but few trials directly compare synchronous telehealth and in-person care for chronic disease management [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] particularly among patients with SUDs.</p><p>Second, the relationship between telehealth and utilization is complex. With respect to addiction treatment, patients with SUDs face treatment barriers such as service availability and affordability, stigma, criminalization, impaired psychosocial functioning, and varying levels of readiness for change [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Telehealth can mitigate some barriers by heightening patient anonymity, reducing the need for transportation, enhancing scheduling flexibility, and decreasing the time required to receive care, all of which lower the threshold for treatment engagement [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These features may be particularly relevant for patients with limited financial resources, which is common among patients with SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who often have less job flexibility [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and unreliable transportation [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, telehealth requires digital literacy, access to technology, internet, and a location to receive remote health care [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among patients with SUDs, high rates of homelessness and financial insecurity create barriers to telehealth [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The failure of telehealth to fully compensate for PHE primary care disruptions may indicate barriers to telehealth in the Wisconsin Medicaid population. Critically, disproportionate rates of poverty, homelessness and justice-involvement among patients with SUDs from racial and ethnic minority groups demonstrate how structural racism continues to limit treatment utilization [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Without intentional deployment of telehealth services, telehealth expansion could unintentionally exacerbate racial disparities by further facilitating access for those with increased financial and social resources [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Health systems will need to be attentive to the downstream effects of telehealth expansion to ensure that such initiatives decrease, rather than deepen, health disparities for patients with SUDs.</p><p>Finally, telehealth benefits may depend on clinical characteristics like SUD type. For example, treatment for opioid use disorder emphasizes medications while stimulant use disorder emphasizes behavioral interventions [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While some evidence suggests that telehealth represents an effective platform for medication management of opioid use disorder [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the same may not be true for complex behavioral interventions like contingency management for stimulant use disorder. As a result, telehealth may be more appropriate for certain SUDs. Alternatively, telehealth benefits may vary by disease severity. Research demonstrates higher rates of telehealth services among those with more severe SUDs [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. If these trends persist, telehealth might expand treatment for severe SUDs, but do less to prevent disease progression.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, we required continuous enrollment to minimize bias from compositional changes. This restriction may limit the generalizability of findings to the broader Medicaid population, which often exhibits churning [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The MOE protections preventing Medicaid disenrollment during the PHE lessens this limitation. Second, we required an established SUD or diabetes diagnosis prior to study start. Thus, our findings do not reflect utilization among newly diagnosed, undiagnosed, or previously diagnosed individuals without a claim in the six months before study start. Relatedly, use of ICD10 codes from claims to identify individuals with diabetes and SUDs has limitations. As a result, we may have misclassified individuals by type of diabetes or presence of an SUD [<xref rid="pone.0299397.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299397.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Third, in using claims data, we may have missed disease-specific services if SUD or diabetes diagnoses were not recorded. Fourth, we may have missed telehealth services that were miscoded or not submitted for reimbursement. Fifth, it is likely that the patients in the SUD and diabetes cohorts differ in ways not captured in the data, such as presence of carceral involvement and housing instability. These factors also generate barriers to in person care. As a result, our findings may underestimate the engagement advantage of expanding telehealth services. Finally, our analyses may not be generalizable to other states.</p><p>In sum, due to the considerable adverse health effects of substance use, patients with SUDs experience disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Yet, few patients with SUDs receive adequate treatment for medical and addiction diagnoses. In this study, we found that telehealth expansion increased treatment utilization for patients with SUDs beyond that observed for patients with diabetes. This advantage helped mitigate the greater disruption in health care experienced by patients with SUDs due to the PHE. Notably, telehealth expansion was unable to fully compensate for these disruptions in care for either patients with SUDs or diabetes. The degree to which this deficit in utilization reflects structural barriers to telehealth in low-income patient populations is unclear. Health systems and policymakers attempting to expand telehealth services should create mechanisms to reduce telehealth barriers and track telehealth utilization to ensure that telehealth expansion does not exacerbate disparities in health status or health care utilization for patients with SUDs relative to other patient populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0299397.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Sample construction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0299397.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0299397.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Comparison of analytic sample to population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0299397.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0299397.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Definition of outcome measures.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0299397.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0299397.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><title>Regression models technical appendix.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0299397.s004.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors of this work are solely responsible for the content therein.

This paper fills an important gap in the literature by conducting a comparative analysis focused on low-income patient populations on Medicaid.</p><p>While I appreciate the authors efforts to choose an appropriate comparison group, Medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes differ substantially from beneficiaries with SUD. This is demonstrated in the table, in which all sociodemographic variables are statistically significantly different between groups despite exhibiting similar insurance coverage. The biggest limitation of this analysis is that there are likely several other characteristics that differ between the populations (e.g., criminal-legal involvement, stigma, employment, homelessness, etc.) and impact health care utilization which were not accounted for.</p><p>The authors highlight that this study cohort includes nonpregnant, nondisabled adults. It is important to highlight that this cohort also represents noninstitutionalized adults.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could provide a breakdown of the SUDs to understand which SUDs are most/least prevalent. This has important implications for interpreting the findings because treatment and care is vastly different across SUDs.</p><p>While all analyses resulted in statistically significant findings, the differences were often small (e.g., 0.5 percentage point difference in Model 1, which translates to a difference of 5 visits per 1,000 beneficiaries). The discussion section should explain clinical significance &#8211; is 5 office visits per 1,000 persons clinically meaningful?</p><p>Lines 265-266: There is an important typo (you report a comparison between beneficiaries with diabetes and beneficiaries with diabetes).</p><p>Lines 351-352: How would you have misclassified individuals by type of diabetes?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;In PONE-D-23-11600, &#8220;Can telehealth expansion boost health care utilization specifically for patients with substance use disorders relative to patients with other types of chronic disease?&#8221; the authors use administrative data from Wisconsin&#8217;s Medicaid program to examine patterns in primary care telehealth use for beneficiaries with SUDs relative to beneficiaries with Type 2 Diabetes. The authors find that at the onset of the public health emergency, beneficiaries with SUDs were less likely to have primary care encounters than beneficiaries with diabetes, but more likely to have telehealth encounters. This presents important evidence about the take-up of telehealth among Medicaid beneficiaries with SUDs that can inform efforts to increase access to telehealth for this group.</p><p>I have a few comments:</p><p>1. My primary comment is that PlosOne is not a medical journal so understanding the role of primary care in treatment of patients with diagnoses of SUD and Type 2 Diabetes is critical for the reader. How much of the treatment for these two conditions is in the primary care setting? What do providers do in these encounters that they are able to do remotely? (How diabetes can be managed remotely is explained briefly for diabetes lines 108-109 but is not explained for SUD. Additional context for diabetes would be helpful as well as providing context for telehealth encounters to treat SUD in the primary care setting.)</p><p>2. The authors include comorbid psychotic disorder as a covariate and it would be helpful to control other comorbidities. The presence of other chronic conditions would likely be correlated with use of telehealth. As mentioned in the introduction, patients who are also managing cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease might be more likely to have in-person visits because management of those conditions benefits from in-person encounters and/or laboratory work.</p><p>3. In the conclusion, the authors discuss that telehealth may be more appropriate for some types of SUDs (though of the two examples it is not stated which telehealth is more appropriate for&#8212;opioid use disorder or stimulant use disorder). Is it possible to examine whether the relative increase in telehealth you see is widely experienced across all types of SUD or more prevalent for some types of SUD?</p><p>4. In the conclusion, the authors note that those with more severe SUDs have higher rates of telehealth use. Can the authors identify severe SUD in their data and confirm whether the relative increase you observe is widely experienced among all levels of SUD or concentrated among severe SUD?</p><p>5. A key sample restriction is that the beneficiaries must be continuously enrolled in Medicaid 6/19-12/20. This results in losing nearly 70 percent of the sample. Is this in line with other work in the pre-COVID era that makes a similar restriction?</p><p>6. To understand who is dropped by the continuous enrollment restriction, it would be helpful to add two columns to Appendix Table 2 showing means and % for observable characteristics for respondents with at least one month of parent/caretaker or childless adult eligibility but no continuous enrollment June 2019-Dec 2020.</p><p>7. In introducing Figure 2, the authors note that beneficiaries with diabetes are more likely to have a primary care visit that does not note a diabetes diagnosis. If possible, it would be helpful to provide some context for why primary care providers are less likely to list diabetes as a diagnosis code than SUD.</p><p>8. Line 265: I think the text should read &#8220;Specifically, the fraction of telehealth visits for beneficiaries with SUDs was 1.8 percentage points higher than beneficiaries with diabetes (Model 3: MRD: 0.018; 95% &#8230;)&#8221;</p><p>9.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Ray and the Editorial Board of PLOS ONE,</p><p>Thank you for your recent feedback on our submitted manuscript, &#8220;Can telehealth expansion boost health care utilization specifically for patients with substance use disorders relative to patients with other types of chronic disease?&#8221; We are pleased to submit a revised version. As requested, we have provided a point-by-point response to both reviewers&#8217; comments and completed the necessary formatting and file adjustments. Thank you in advance for considering the revised version of our manuscript. We feel the article is improved through this revision process. </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Alyssa Shell Tilhou, MD, PhD</p><p>Boston University Medical Center</p><p>Response to Reviewers </p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>This study compared the impact of telehealth expansion during the COVID-19 public health emergency on primary care utilization for patients with substance use disorders and diabetes. This paper fills an important gap in the literature by conducting a comparative analysis focused on low-income patient populations on Medicaid.</p><p>While I appreciate the authors efforts to choose an appropriate comparison group, Medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes differ substantially from beneficiaries with SUD. This is demonstrated in the table, in which all sociodemographic variables are statistically significantly different between groups despite exhibiting similar insurance coverage. The biggest limitation of this analysis is that there are likely several other characteristics that differ between the populations (e.g., criminal-legal involvement, stigma, employment, homelessness, etc.) and impact health care utilization which were not accounted for.</p><p>We appreciate the relevance of this comment and have added our inability to control for these and other social factors influencing health care utilization to the limitations section (lines 381-384). Of note, factors like criminal-legal involvement, stigma and homelessness increase challenges to in-person care, specifically, that may be somewhat mitigated by transition to remote telehealth care. As a result, while these differences are a limitation to the study, our findings likely underestimate the advantage of telehealth expansion for patients with SUDs relative to patients with diabetes.</p><p>The authors highlight that this study cohort includes nonpregnant, nondisabled adults. It is important to highlight that this cohort also represents noninstitutionalized adults.</p><p>This cohort characteristic has been added to the methods section (line 151). </p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could provide a breakdown of the SUDs to understand which SUDs are most/least prevalent. This has important implications for interpreting the findings because treatment and care is vastly different across SUDs.</p><p>In this sample, roughly 30.5% have OUD, 27.2% have alcohol use disorder, 8.6% have cannabis use disorder, 4.7% have a stimulant use disorder, 0.4% have a sedative use disorder, 3.5% have a different type of substance use disorder and 25.2% have two or more substance use disorders. We have included this information in the text of the results section (line 226-229).</p><p>While all analyses resulted in statistically significant findings, the differences were often small (e.g., 0.5 percentage point difference in Model 1, which translates to a difference of 5 visits per 1,000 beneficiaries). The discussion section should explain clinical significance &#8211; is 5 office visits per 1,000 persons clinically meaningful?</p><p>Thank you for this comment. To clarify, these are visits per week. In the example provided, 5 office visits per week would translate into 260 per year (5 x 52 weeks), or 26 visits per 100 beneficiaries. We have added this clarification to the results (lines 275 and 278) and a caveat to the discussion section in lines 326-328, shown below.</p><p>&#8220;Notably, additional strategies will be needed to bolster treatment engagement among patients with SUDs given the relatively modest, though statistically significant, advantage offered by telehealth for visit completion.&#8221;</p><p>Lines 265-266: There is an important typo (you report a comparison between beneficiaries with diabetes and beneficiaries with diabetes).</p><p>Thank you for this correction. This error has been corrected (now line 280). </p><p>Lines 351-352: How would you have misclassified individuals by type of diabetes?</p><p>There are a large number of ICD10 diabetes codes, many of which are not type 1 diabetes but also do not indicate type 2 diabetes, our target diagnostic group. There is documented user error assigning the wrong diagnostic code based on type of diabetes diagnosis.1 It is also possible to misclassify patients with substance use disorder based on ICD10 codes.2 We have added the possibility for misclassification of individuals with SUDs, as well as diabetes, to the manuscript: </p><p>&#8220;Relatedly, use of ICD10 codes from claims to identify individuals with diabetes and SUDs has limitations. As a result, we may have misclassified individuals by type of diabetes or presence of an SUD.&#8221;</p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>In PONE-D-23-11600, &#8220;Can telehealth expansion boost health care utilization specifically for patients with substance use disorders relative to patients with other types of chronic disease?&#8221; the authors use administrative data from Wisconsin&#8217;s Medicaid program to examine patterns in primary care telehealth use for beneficiaries with SUDs relative to beneficiaries with Type 2 Diabetes. The authors find that at the onset of the public health emergency, beneficiaries with SUDs were less likely to have primary care encounters than beneficiaries with diabetes, but more likely to have telehealth encounters. This presents important evidence about the take-up of telehealth among Medicaid beneficiaries with SUDs that can inform efforts to increase access to telehealth for this group.</p><p>I have a few comments:</p><p>1. My primary comment is that PlosOne is not a medical journal so understanding the role of primary care in treatment of patients with diagnoses of SUD and Type 2 Diabetes is critical for the reader. How much of the treatment for these two conditions is in the primary care setting? What do providers do in these encounters that they are able to do remotely? (How diabetes can be managed remotely is explained briefly for diabetes lines 108-109 but is not explained for SUD. Additional context for diabetes would be helpful as well as providing context for telehealth encounters to treat SUD in the primary care setting.)</p><p>Thank you for this recommendation. We have provided increased context describing 1) the role of primary care for both conditions (lines 130-133) and 2) the effectiveness and content of telehealth for SUD care (lines 98-101) and diabetes care (lines 113-117). </p><p>&#8220;Given the central role of primary care in providing addiction and medical services to patients with SUDs and diabetes,3&#8211;6 examining the impact of telehealth incorporation on primary care utilization holds particular relevance for reducing utilization disparities for patients with SUDs.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Telehealth may also represent an effective modality for treating patients with SUDs given mounting evidence that the core of SUD care &#8211; counseling and medication management &#8211; can be delivered via telehealth with at or near comparable outcomes to in person care.&#8221;7&#8211;10</p><p>&#8220;Specifically, patients with type 2 diabetes offer a compelling comparison group. In contrast with management of cardiac, pulmonary, renal and hepatic disease, which is more substantially improved by in-person examination and laboratory data, much of the management of type 2 diabetes can occur remotely via collaborative retrospective evaluation of home glucose monitoring.&#8221;</p><p>2. The authors include comorbid psychotic disorder as a covariate and it would be helpful to control other comorbidities. The presence of other chronic conditions would likely be correlated with use of telehealth. As mentioned in the introduction, patients who are also managing cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease might be more likely to have in-person visits because management of those conditions benefits from in-person encounters and/or laboratory work.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Incorporating a chronic disease covariate, our models now control for the presence of chronic disease comorbidities using a binary factor representing the baseline presence of one of the following chronic conditions: asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, thyroid disorders, heart failure, chronic liver disease, and osteoarthritis. This variable is described in lines 189-191. </p><p>&#8220;Chronic medical conditions included asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, thyroid disorders, heart failure, chronic liver disease, and osteoarthritis.&#8221;</p><p>Our models in the revised version of the manuscript and appendix reflect updated regression results including this new covariate. The addition of a chronic disease covariate did not substantively impact results. Patients with SUDs still exhibited a larger decline in primary care utilization post-PHE relative to those with diabetes (by 0.6 percentage points instead of 0.5 percentage points with a p value &lt;0.001). Beneficiaries with SUDs exhibited greater likelihood of telehealth utilization at the same margin as without the chronic disease covariate (0.2 percentage points, p&lt;0.001). The difference in fraction of visits completed by telehealth also remained similar: beneficiaries with SUDs exhibited a greater fraction of telehealth visits relative to beneficiaries with diabetes at a margin of 0.019 instead of 0.018 (p=0.025). These results can be seen in Table 2 of the manuscript with the technical results now shown in Appendix 4.</p><p>3. In the conclusion, the authors discuss that telehealth may be more appropriate for some types of SUDs (though of the two examples it is not stated which telehealth is more appropriate for&#8212;opioid use disorder or stimulant use disorder). Is it possible to examine whether the relative increase in telehealth you see is widely experienced across all types of SUD or more prevalent for some types of SUD?</p><p>In a parallel paper, we have focused on trends in telehealth expansion by SUD type. We hope this paper will be published in the near future. In the meantime, we have clarified the different advantages and limitations for the two referenced SUDs in lines 362-365.</p><p>&#8220;While some evidence suggests that telehealth represents an effective platform for medication management of opioid use disorder, the same may not be true for complex behavioral interventions like contingency management for stimulant use disorder.&#8221;</p><p>4. In the conclusion, the authors note that those with more severe SUDs have higher rates of telehealth use. Can the authors identify severe SUD in their data and confirm whether the relative increase you observe is widely experienced among all levels of SUD or concentrated among severe SUD?</p><p>We are not able to assess severity in the claims data. Rather, in referencing previously published work, we intended to identify the possibility that telehealth expansion may not equally support all patients with SUDs and may be more preferentially used by those with increased disease severity. </p><p>5. A key sample restriction is that the beneficiaries must be continuously enrolled in Medicaid 6/19-12/20. This results in losing nearly 70 percent of the sample. Is this in line with other work in the pre-COVID era that makes a similar restriction?</p><p>Thank you for this question, which drew our attention to an error in Appendix 1, our sample construction table. Here we report the population with at least one month of eligibility June 2019-December 2020. However, the appropriate initial population to display are adults enrolled in June 2019 via parent/caretaker or childless adult eligibility and no eligibility due to pregnancy at any point June 2019-December 2020 (N=273,105). We have revised the original table, which is pasted below and included in a tracked and corrected version of the appendix (rows 1-4). In addition, we repeated the sample construction process one year prior to our study population based on enrollment in June 2018 (rows 5-8) to allow comparison with a time frame fully preceding the pandemic (N=277,591). The results from this comparison cohort are included below. In the study cohort, 52.7% of the initial population are continuously enrolled for 18 months (N=143,992); in the pre-PHE cohort, 40.5% of the initial population are continuously enrolled for 18 months (n=112,286). The increased population with continuous enrollment in the study cohort relative to the pre-PHE cohort is likely due to the maintenance of eligibility protections provided by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which prohibited Medicaid beneficiary disenrollment during the PHE (and therefore resulted in an increased proportion of beneficiaries with continuous enrollment). This means that our cohort is more representative of the general population than it might typically be, due to the lower attrition rate.</p><p>Appendix 1.

To understand who is dropped by the continuous enrollment restriction, it would be helpful to add two columns to Appendix Table 2 showing means and % for observable characteristics for respondents with at least one month of parent/caretaker or childless adult eligibility but no continuous enrollment June 2019-Dec 2020.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have completed this request in Appendix 2. We begin with the population enrolled in June 2019 without any eligibility in the study period due to pregnancy (N=273,105). We then remove N=143,992 individuals with continuous enrollment in the study period leaving N=129,113 who were not enrolled continuously. The characteristics of these individuals are now shown in the first two columns of Appendix 2, also included below. Individuals without continuous enrollment exhibit a higher proportion parents/caretakers and psychotic disorder, and lower proportion missing geography and with income &#8804;50% federal poverty level. Otherwise, the two groups are fairly similar.</p><p>Appendix 2.

In introducing Figure 2, the authors note that beneficiaries with diabetes are more likely to have a primary care visit that does not note a diabetes diagnosis. If possible, it would be helpful to provide some context for why primary care providers are less likely to list diabetes as a diagnosis code than SUD.</p><p>Thank you, we also considered this difference to be an interesting finding. In lines 311-314, we discuss that diseases like diabetes may be more easily compartmentalized and thus not addressed at every visit. In contrast, SUDs have a more expansive impact on wellness and therefore appear at a higher proportion of visits. We have added one more theory to bolster this aspect of the discussion (line 362-365). </p><p>&#8220;It may also be that the stigma of substance use makes SUD diagnoses more notable and therefore documented more frequently by clinicians.&#8221;</p><p>8.

I have a few formatting/presentation suggestions:</p><p>Discussion of Fig 1: I cannot see on the figure that diabetes initially had more visits (may be that the chosen colors make it hard to differentiate?) (around line 212)</p><p>We have corrected the wording in this section to clarify our intent and compare visits across individuals in the diabetes and SUD cohort (line 213 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>&#8220;Of cohort members completing visits in the week post-PHE, a slightly greater percentage of the diabetes cohort initially completed visits via telehealth relative to the SUD cohort.&#8221;</p><p>Table 1: Didn&#8217;t you add other comorbid conditions that would make more sense to show in the Comorbid diagnosis panel other than &#8220;SUD and diabetes&#8221;?</p><p>Chronic disease comorbidities has been added as a row to Table 1. Thank you for this correction. </p><p>Table 1: consider removing &#8220;missing sex&#8221; row? (because it is 0 for all?)</p><p>Completed (including in the appendix).</p><p>Table 1: consider removing &#8220;missing income&#8221; row? (because it is not missing for any?)</p><p>Completed (including in the appendix). </p><p>Figure 1: change label to read &#8220;in person&#8221; not IP? (Some health econ readers might infer IP=inpatient?)</p><p>Completed. </p><p>Titles to Fig 1 and 2: I think you need to add &#8220;diagnosis&#8221;</p><p>Completed. </p><p>Parentheses to close on line 200</p><p>Completed. </p><p>Exhibiting not exhibited on line 202</p><p>Completed. </p><p>7.
