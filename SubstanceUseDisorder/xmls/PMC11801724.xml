Brief negotiational interventions (BNIs) in emergency departments (EDs) effectively reduce alcohol intake and re-injury rates. However, most BNIs are developed in high-income countries, with limited evidence of their effectiveness in LMICs. To address this gap, we culturally adapted a BNI for alcohol-related injury patients at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. Our study followed the ADAPT guidance to culturally adapt an existing high-income country BNI for use in the KCMC, a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. The adaptation included: 1) a systematic review of effective alcohol harm reduction interventions in similar settings; 2) consultations with local and international healthcare professionals experienced in counseling and substance abuse treatment; 3) group discussions to refine goals and finalize adaptations. The adapted BNI protocol and assessment scales ensured intervention fidelity. At KCMC, 30% of injury patients screened positive for alcohol use disorder (AUD), with a five-fold increased risk of injury, primarily from road traffic accidents and violence. A systematic review highlighted limited data on patient-level interventions in low-resource settings. Our adapted BNI, &#8216;<italic toggle="yes">Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako</italic> (PPKAY)&#8217;, based on the FRAMES model, showed high feasibility and acceptability, with 84% of interventions achieving &#8805;80% adherence and 98% patient satisfaction. PPKAY is the first culturally adapted alcohol BNI for injury patients in an African ED. Our study demonstrates our approach to adapting substance use interventions for use in low resource settings and shows that cultural adaptation of alcohol use interventions is feasible, beneficial and empowering for our team.

Similarly, injuries account for 5.8 million of the world&#8217;s total annual deaths, making it a leading contributor to global mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among all deaths resulting from harmful alcohol use, 28.7% are caused by injuries [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), specifically those in Africa, carry the greatest burden of both alcohol consumption and injury rates [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The global rate of injury deaths per 100,000 people is 80.1 [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, this rate increases to 98.8 per 100,000 people in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, the global rate of alcohol consumption is 32.8 grams of pure alcohol per day per drinker whereas in Africa this rate increases to 40.0 grams of pure alcohol per day per drinker [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for morbidity among 15&#8211;24 year-old males in sub-Saharan Africa and is only expected to increase in coming years [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Within Sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania has high rates of alcohol-related injury. At Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, it is estimated that 46.9% of patients presenting with injuries to the emergency department (ED) test positive for alcohol [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) the regional referral hospital in Moshi, Tanzania, we estimated that 30% of injury patients presenting to the ED were positive for alcohol [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in Tanzania is high. In a survey of 1954 men and women aged 15&#8211;24 years from Kilimanjaro and Mwanza regions, 10.5% screened positive for AUD [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a similar survey of 899 men and women aged 18&#8211;59 years from Dar es Salaam, the prevalence of hazardous drinking was 5.7% [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most recent WHO estimate places the prevalence of AUD in Tanzania at 6.8% [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Harmful alcohol use appears to be higher among injury patients presenting to EDs when compared to Tanzania&#8217;s general population. Consequently, alcohol use reduction interventions targeting high risk ED injury patients may be an initial effective and efficient means of reducing harmful drinking and injury rates in the population.</p><p>A brief negotiational intervention (BNI) is a single session interview, lasting no more than 30 minutes, which attempts to reduce harmful post-hospitalization alcohol use [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In high- and middle-income countries, the delivery of BNIs in the emergency department or during hospitalization for an injury has been proven effective in reducing both post-hospital alcohol consumption and post-hospital alcohol-related injury [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of a BNI in reducing harmful alcohol use among injury patients in Tanzania is still currently unknown. Studies assessing the impact of BNIs on alcohol consumption in Africa have occurred predominantly in South Africa [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To optimize the effectiveness of a BNI in producing the desired outcome, the BNI must be sensitive to a patient&#8217;s culture and environment. Patients in different regions of the world may experience vastly different stressors that influence harmful alcohol and which result from unique cultural norms or acculturation experiences. The cultural adaptation of BNIs to account for such stressors among subpopulations with specific demographics is shown to be effective in improving patient outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As such, the aim of this study was to use the ADAPT guidance to culturally adapt a BNI for delivery to injury patients presenting to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) ED in Moshi, Tanzania. Here we describe the process of culturally adapting a BNI to reduce post-injury alcohol use for implementation in this patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Setting</title><p>KCMC is a zonal tertiary referral hospital serving a population of 15 million people in Northern Tanzania [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Moreover, it has been shown that greater alcohol consumption is associated with increased odds of injury among patients presenting to the KCMC ED [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].Currently, there are limited treatment options for alcohol-reducing interventions for patients and community members, and a lack of awareness of available resources. In many LMICs with limited numbers of mental health providers and lack of treatment facilities specifically for alcohol addiction, the task of providing alcohol treatment services is then often placed on the health system [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

All team members agreed that sitting if possible, introducing oneself, and inquiring if the patient&#8217;s health concerns have been addressed including any pain, discomfort or hunger should be the first priority in this initial interaction. If initial interactions identified any patient discomfort or concerns, the BNI process should be postponed until the patient is more able to interact comfortably. Similarly, our context has important and at times prolonged customary greetings; as such, our first step in the PPKAY, therefore begins with these customary greetings.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Introducing the topic of alcohol.</title><p>In our focus groups with healthcare professionals, it was mentioned that it was common for healthcare practitioners to ask about alcohol, but was, at times, stigmatizing. As such, before directing the conversation towards alcohol the provider should ask the patient for permission to discuss alcohol and we integrated the alcohol use questions in a framework of overall healthy behavior.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Interventionist characteristics.</title><p>Local professionals in our focus groups emphasized the importance of the characteristics of the person who conducts the BNI for our target population (men and women 18 years or older). According to our focus groups, participants thought it could be inappropriate and perhaps even counterproductive to have a young male administer the BNI to an older male; local professionals and patients recommended that experienced female nurses, typical of Tanzania&#8217;s nursing population, would elicit the most productive feedback or discussions with patients, and would be perceived more positively. It was believed amongst our participants that, when speaking to elderly female nurses, patients are more comfortable discussing alcohol and listening to advice as they are talking to an elder like their mother/grandmother. In contrast, our focus groups also highlighted that the Muslim male population would not be comfortable discussing alcohol use with a female provider because of religious/cultural norms. While Tanzania does have a large Muslim population, Muslim males are a minority of our ED injury population. Ultimately, our team agreed that having senior female nurses and at least one male nurse available to deliver BNIs was the best option.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Provide feedback</title><p>Cultural adaptation of this BNI step focused on 1) alcohol use patterns at the Tanzanian versus other levels, 2) use of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) as a marker of normative and increased risk behavior in the Tanzanian setting, 3) culturally and linguistically appropriate Swahili words to describe alcohol use, alcohol amounts, and alcohol use disorders, and 4) the most common complications of alcohol use in our setting.</p><sec id="sec037"><title>Population-level alcohol use patterns.</title><p>To help patients compare their alcohol use to societal norms, our focus groups and patient feedback suggested it was important to relate a patient&#8217;s alcohol use behavior to alcohol use patterns at the population level. Overall, our focus groups discussed how the population presenting to our health system is mostly a local population who are somewhat insulated and as such, international guidelines are less relatable to the typical patient than national or regional guidelines. Our team agreed that offering patients a description of alcohol norms from a regional perspective would allow patients to better contextualize their own alcohol-related behavior. However, our team suggested allowing the discussion around alcohol norms to remain malleable. The conversation should begin with regional alcohol norms but can shift to national or international norms if the interventionist feels these norms are more in line with the patient&#8217;s own alcohol-related behavior. As an additional means of helping patients contextualize and quantify their alcohol use within the regional population, we created a visual guide to standard drinks (<xref rid="pgph.0004200.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) that can be shared during the discussion of population-level alcohol use patterns.</p><fig position="float" id="pgph.0004200.g003" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgph.0004200.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Our standard drink guide for the Tanzanian setting.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pgph.0004200.g003.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Administration and explanation of the AUDIT.</title><p>Our team has previously conducted multiple validations of the AUDIT in Tanzania&#8217;s injury patient population to ensure both content and clinical validation[<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].&#160;Our research team decided the AUDIT was the best way to screen ED patients for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption due to both its quantity and consequence measurement components. Next our adapted BNI protocol offers feedback regarding their personal AUDIT score. To facilitate discussion regarding the AUDIT, our team used the Range, Anecdote, Normal, Give, Elicit (RANGE) mnemonic to assist nurses in discussing AUDIT results. In the RANGE model, the interventionist states the range of possible AUDIT scores, provides an anecdote exemplifying the AUDIT&#8217;s validity, states the range of scores corresponding to normal alcohol use, reveals the patient&#8217;s AUDIT score, and elicits feedback from the patient by asking what he or she thinks of their score.</p></sec><sec id="sec039"><title>Linguistic adaptations.</title><p>In our focus groups, linguistic and culturally appropriate non-judgmental words were chosen and enforced by our bilingual team performing the intervention (<xref rid="pgph.0004200.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Cultural adaptation of step 3 focused on 1) the development of a readiness to change ruler appropriate to the setting, 2) making a link between alcohol-related consequences and a patient&#8217;s alcohol use, 3) making a link between a patient&#8217;s personal problems and their alcohol use, and 4) using motivational techniques to encourage behavior change.</p><sec id="sec042"><title>Developing a readiness to change ruler.</title><p>All members of our focus group decided that a 0&#8211;100 scale ranging from &#8220;not at all ready&#8221; to &#8220;extremely ready&#8221; was appropriate for assessing readiness to change in our setting. Initially, some of our external professionals opposed a 0&#8211;00 scale, and proposed a 0&#8211;10 scale, given the nature of the question. A self-evaluation of readiness to change requires significant thought and reflection. A 0&#8211;100 scale presents too large a range of possibilities to choose from which may hinder or stall the goal of assessing readiness. However, local members expressed strong support for a 0&#8211;100 scale because numerical expressions in terms of percentages are more common in Tanzanian society. Even at basic schooling levels, tests are scored on a 0&#8211;100 scale, thus being more universally known.</p><p>External professionals in our focus groups also noted that the goal of assessing readiness to change is to specifically identify why an individual patient thinks he or she needs to change. Consequently, we highlighted the following question to supplement the readiness to change ruler: <bold>&#8220;why did you not pick a lower number?&#8221;</bold> Such a question encourages the patient to defend their reasons for being ready to change, rather than the contrary, &#8220;why did you not pick a higher number?&#8221; which highlights barriers to change.</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>Establishing a link between alcohol use, its consequences, and personal problems.</title><p>Focus groups agreed that the link between alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences, such as injuries, is not obvious to many patients in our setting. Our team concluded there is a general lack of understanding in our setting regarding safe drinking limits; similarly, there is a large barrier to understanding the difference between causation and association of alcohol use and alcohol consequences. The third step of our PPKAY, therefore, establishes the link between harmful alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences, discusses ways that alcohol can be associated with consequences as opposed to a causative process, and discusses the patient&#8217;s personal experiences with use and consequences. If a patient does not understand the connection between their alcohol use and their personal problems, then he or she is unlikely to be receptive towards behavior change.</p></sec><sec id="sec044"><title>Encouraging behavior change.</title><p>Focus groups revealed that care in the Tanzanian setting is often paternalistic with physicians providing specific instructions in the form of commands (i.e., &#8220;do this&#8221; or &#8220;do not do this&#8221;). Encouraging or empowering, rather than telling, patients to change their behavior is uncommon. Consequently, the third step of our PPKAY ends with the interventionist summarizing the discussion from this step using motivational techniques outlined in the model BNI protocol. These techniques include expressing empathy towards the patient, developing discrepancy between the patient&#8217;s alcohol use behavior and good health, &#8220;rolling with&#8221; a patient&#8217;s resistance to behavior change so as to avoid confrontation and elicit productive feedback, and supporting the patient&#8217;s self-efficacy and confidence to build motivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec045"><title>Negotiation and advice</title><p>The final step of the PPKAY creates a plan for the patient to reduce harm resulting from alcohol use, offers advice to the patient regarding their alcohol use, and formalizes an agreement between the patient and the interviewer. Cultural adaptation of step 4 focused on 1) developing an array of patient options for reducing alcohol-related harm, 2) discussing the most effective way to offer advice to a patient, 3) discussing the most practical way to formalize an agreement with a patient, and 4) deciding how to summarize the results of the intervention.</p><sec id="sec046"><title>Reducing alcohol-related harm and offering advice.</title><p>Our focus groups agree with the BNI suggested MENUS of change options: <bold>m</bold>anage drinking, <bold>e</bold>liminate drinking from your life, <bold>n</bold>ever drink and drive, reduce your <bold>u</bold>sual drinking pattern, and <bold>s</bold>eek help. In our setting, given the cultural acceptance and prevalence of drink driving [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the limited regulations our project team chose to highlight the &#8216;never drink and drive&#8217; option for all patients in addition to their personal choice of action. It is important to note that each of these options may not apply to each patient. Thus, options should be modified and presented to individuals at the discretion of the interventionist.</p><p>Members of our focus groups agreed asking patients for permission to offer advice is not necessary because the intervention implies that professional advice will be given. However, we included asking for permission to give advice in step four of our adapted BNI protocol as a way of keeping the patient comfortable and in control of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec047"><title>Formalizing an agreement.</title><p>To reinforce a patient&#8217;s commitment to behavior change, all focus group members agreed that a verbal agreement was most appropriate as many patients in our Tanzanian setting have low education and as such relatively limited writing capacity and a low literacy rate. Focus group members also agreed that asking patients to identify a potential supporter of change should be part of the agreement process to make patients feel like they do not have to confront behavior change alone. However, identifying a personal supporter of change is entirely optional as some patients may feel uncomfortable sharing private information with family or friends. In our setting, a referral to other treatment options is an intermittently available option, becoming more available with the establishment of different mental health clinics in the region, so referral to these options has been increasing. We have assembled a locally relevant list of alcohol treatment resources and potential costs for patients for further care and support in this process.</p></sec><sec id="sec048"><title>Summarizing results of the BNI.</title><p>The final element of the PPKAY is to present a summary of the intervention that emphasizes the patient&#8217;s statements, strengths, and agreement. All members of our focus group agreed that the summary should end by giving control back to the patient. Following the summary, we, therefore, added the following question: &#8220;Are there any additional statements you would like to add?&#8221; By asking this final question, the patient has the opportunity to end the intervention with their own concluding remarks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec049"><title>ADAPT step 3</title><sec id="sec050"><title>Intervention fidelity.</title><p>In total, 65 of the 75 participants who were enrolled in our feasibility evaluation took part in the PPKAY intervention and each of these were administered by one of our three female nurse interventionists (<xref rid="pgph.0004200.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

There is some personnel/nurse turnover in the ED as well as swapping of nurses from department to department. As such, we have established nurse champions in multiple wards who are adept at performing the intervention. Similar to other interventions administered in the KCMC health system, a modest nurse reimbursement for interventions performed was suggested, at 2000 Tanzanian shillings or less than $1.00 for a quality intervention performed. Understanding that we were adding screening and referrals for patients who screened positive for an AUD, we continued to monitor both numbers of inpatient and outpatient referrals as well as those who showed up to clinics for our health system balance measures. Finally, we implemented a strong intervention fidelity system to reduce intervention drift especially given the anticipated large number of nurses who were conducting this intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec053"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are few culturally adapted alcohol harm reduction brief interventions suitable for an ED setting of a low-resource setting. Our Tanzanian ED setting has both limited resource availability as well as a high burden of alcohol use disorder and alcohol related consequences. Through a multiphase iterative process driven by local patient input, perspectives, experiences and preferences, and focus groups from local healthcare professionals and supplemented with guidance from external professionals, we culturally adapted a BNI to the Tanzanian setting, culture, and language. To our knowledge, this is the first AUD intervention to be adapted specifically for acute injury patients in an LMIC population.</p><sec id="sec054"><title>The need for cultural adaptation</title><p>The prevalence of alcohol abuse in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania is among the highest in the country, exceeding values representative of other regions as well as the entire nation [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The even larger prevalence of self-reported or clinician-detected alcohol use among injury patients seeking emergency care highlights the need for evidence-based AUD interventions that can be implemented in Tanzanian EDs [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To be effective, such interventions require adaptation to the local cultural context. Given the influence of one&#8217;s cultural environment, demographic factors such as age and gender are very important and need to be considered due to the sensitive or stigmatizing topics to be discussed [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that cultural adaptation of a substance use intervention can encompass a broad range of changes to the original intervention protocol. These changes may determine who administers the intervention, how a patient is greeted, how the topic of substance abuse is raised, how a patient is informed of their harmful substance use, how graphics are visualized within the intervention protocol, how behavior change is motivated, and which behavior changes are encouraged. While such changes may not be required in every unique cultural setting, the results of our study provide a framework that may help construct cultural adaptation procedures for substance use interventions in other LMICs.</p><p>Cultural adaptations have been applied to BNIs for non-Tanzanian populations at increased risk of harmful substance use, and have indicated high participant satisfaction [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, culturally adapted substance use interventions have proven to be more effective than their non-adapted counterpart in reducing harmful behavior in a multitude of settings including both high-income countries and LMICs [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In Tanzania, however, there are no culturally sensitive alcohol use interventions that have been systematically developed and established across healthcare facilities [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our PPKAY tool is the first substance use intervention to be culturally adapted for administration to Tanzanian patients who test positive for harmful alcohol consumption. The numerous changes deemed necessary to make the original intervention protocol applicable to Tanzanian patients highlight the need for rigorous cultural adaptation of interventions developed outside of LMICs, but applied to LMIC populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec055"><title>The cultural adaptation process</title><p>Cultural adaptation refers to modifications of an evidence-based intervention that render the intervention more compatible with the cultural, social, and linguistic behaviors of a target population [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The adaptation process, therefore, relies on community engagement to support the incorporation of these societal norms into the adapted intervention. Notably, a community advisory board (CAB) is commonly used throughout the iterative adaptation process to ensure appropriate cultural translation of a substance use intervention without compromise of the intervention&#8217;s core effective components [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the Tanzanian setting, the use of a CAB alone to guide the adaptation of our intervention was challenging due to limited knowledge among the target population regarding safe alcohol use behaviors, AUD interventions, and local AUD treatment options [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consequently, our approach integrated over five years of prior patient mixed-method data and a team of local healthcare professionals with extensive experience in substance use counseling supported by external professionals with extensive substance use research experience to maintain fidelity of the original intervention protocol throughout the adaptation process. This approach is not entirely unique; Ornelas et al, and Whitty et al, describe provider/patient and provider methods of intervention adaptation for sub-populations in high risk groups of high-income settings [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, our study integrates significant amounts of mixed-method patient-focused data, the collective knowledge of community members, local healthcare professionals, and external professionals creates a rich environment for cultural adaptation of substance use interventions in LMICs, even in settings where community-based participatory research is less common. While our cultural adaptation process has many strengths, it is important to highlight a few limitations. The use of the ADAPT framework presents challenges that were encountered during our adaptation process. The framework can be resource-intensive, requiring significant time and personnel investment, which may not always be available, particularly in low-resource settings such as Tanzania. Additionally, the dependence on extensive mixed-method data and the expertise of both local and international teams, can introduce biases and constraints, particularly if the existing literature and evidence are not entirely reflective of the local context&#8217;s nuances.</p></sec><sec id="sec056"><title>Next steps</title><p>Our PPKAY intervention was designed with the entirety of our target population in mind. In its current form, our BNI seeks to reduce harmful alcohol use for any injury patient with an AUD presenting to KCMC in Moshi, Tanzania. However, the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania is incredibly diverse with regard to age, education, income, religion, tribe, and other sociodemographic factors. Intragroup diversity of this kind may create differences in intervention efficacy between subgroups [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. As we implement our adapted BNI in the Tanzanian setting, it is important that we compare the effectiveness of our intervention overall as well as across these subgroups so that we may continue tailoring our BNI to individuals with specific backgrounds. Furthermore, there is substantial stigma across Tanzanian communities in the Kilimanjaro region towards individuals who exhibit harmful alcohol use [<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004200.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. External and internalized stigma may prevent patients from engaging in conversations elicited by our BNI. It is therefore important that we ensure our intervention can create meaningful behavior change among those who feel stigmatized.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec057"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We adapted a BNI developed to lower the risk of alcohol consequences among ED patients in the United States and adapted it through a multiphase iterative process to create an AUD intervention applicable to ED patients in the Tanzanian setting. Our adapted tool, the PPKAY, is a 15-minute brief intervention that uses motivational interviewing techniques to motivate behavior change among injury patients who engage in harmful alcohol use. Our study outlines the specific steps taken to make the cultural adaptations of this BNI. Our study also demonstrates an approach for how cultural adaptation of substance use interventions can be made in low-income settings as well as settings where community knowledge surrounding substance abuse is limited. Given the scarcity of research on alcohol use in Tanzania and similar settings, we encourage others to explore the cultural adaptation and evaluation of interventions to reach populations in need. Efficacy analysis of this adapted BNI is ongoing at KCMC and results will be reported in a future study.</p></sec><sec id="sec058" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004200.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in global research.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0004200.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0004200.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Reporting guideline.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0004200.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0004200.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization, World Health Organization, World Health Organization, Management of Substance Abuse Team.
