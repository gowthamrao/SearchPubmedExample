added effect on the mental health of low-income adults during the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020 and 2021. We use the 2017-2021 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. We use an event study
difference-in-differences model to compare the number of days in poor mental
health in the past 30&#8201;days and the likelihood of frequent mental distress among
18 to 64&#8201;year old individuals with household incomes below 100% of the federal
poverty level who participated in BRFSS in one of the surveys from 2017 to 2021
and who resided in states that expanded Medicaid by 2016 or states that had not
expanded by 2021. We also examine the heterogeneity of the expansion effects
across subpopulation groups. We find some evidence that the Medicaid expansion
was associated with better mental health during the pandemic for adults younger
than 45, females, and non-Hispanic Black and other non-Hispanic non-White
individuals. There is some evidence of an added benefit to mental health from
Medicaid expansion status during the pandemic for some subgroups among
low-income adults, suggesting potential health benefits from Medicaid
eligibility during public health and economic crises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Affordable Care Act</kwd><kwd>Medicaid expansion</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>frequent mental distress</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-00469580231166738" position="float" orientation="portrait"><list list-type="simple" id="list1-00469580231166738"><list-item><p>

implemented to slow down its spread brought unprecedented economic, social, and
health challenges that likely had major impacts on mental health. Millions of
Americans reported loss of work and income, or reduced work hours because of the pandemic.<sup>

</sup> Compounding and exacerbating the pandemic impacts on mental health were the
fears and worries surrounding COVID-19 risk of infection and related restrictions of
social distancing, business and school closures, quarantines, and isolation, all of
which have had profound social and mental health effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr7-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Mental health disorders affect over 20% of adults and are disproportionally more
prevalent among low-income individuals.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its related
Medicaid expansions, the uninsured rate was markedly higher among individuals with
mental health disorders (20%) compared with the general population (15%), and less
than 50% of people with mental health disorders received treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr11-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Health insurance coverage is
critical to accessing mental health services, particularly among low-income
populations. The ACA Medicaid expansions beginning in 2014 and continuing with
additional states expanding in subsequent years have increased coverage among adults
with household income below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Evidence on
effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions before the pandemic suggests improved access
and utilization of mental and other health care services,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and improved mental

</sup> However, whether there was an added benefit from the prior expansions to
mental health during the pandemic is not well understood. With added shocks to
mental health during the pandemic and disruptions to insurance coverage and access
to essential mental health care services, one hypothesis is that Medicaid coverage
for low-income individuals in expansion states may have buffered against some of the
adverse impacts on mental health by providing greater access to needed mental health
services (such as access to prescription drugs or mental health care providers
providing psychotherapy via telehealth) compared to similar income individuals
without Medicaid coverage in non-expansion states. Furthermore, Medicaid coverage
during the pandemic may have conferred additional financial security in the event of
losing a job or employer-sponsored coverage<sup><xref rid="bibr24-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> or illness, which has been
associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> Therefore, in this study, we examine whether the prior ACA Medicaid
expansions provided an added benefit to the mental health of low-income individuals
compared to non-expansion states during the pandemic.</p><p>Studies report an increase in adverse mental health conditions during the
pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> These conditions worsened among younger adults due to school

increase in depression and anxiety rates among women compared to men as their burden
of responsibilities disproportionately increased during the pandemic.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup> Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations had a greater increase in
self-reported depression and anxiety rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In addition to
disproportionally experiencing economic hardship from the pandemic, Black

incremental effect on mental health of low-income individuals during the pandemic in
two main ways. The first possible mechanism is through access to mental health
services for individuals who needed them, which may include care for newly onset or
worsening prior mental health conditions during the pandemic. Without coverage,
low-income individuals would have little access to such needed services. The second
plausible mechanism is by providing additional financial security from Medicaid
coverage<sup><xref rid="bibr38-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="bibr39-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr40-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr41-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> after (potential) loss of
employer-sponsored coverage as a result of the pandemic-related unemployment or
underemployment, which might reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr42-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
</sup> This second pathway might be especially important during a global pandemic
when most people become keenly attentive to their own and their family&#8217;s health. The
reduction in stress with insurance coverage and financial protection from illness
might be more salient during such time.</p><p>In addition, in March 2020, Congress passed the Families First Coronavirus Response
Act (FFCRA), providing states with an additional 6.2 percentage-point increase in
federal matching assistance percentage (FMAP) to provide continuous coverage for
Medicaid.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="bibr44-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr45-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> This
provision may have increased coverage, reduced churning in Medicaid and interruption
in access to health care services among covered individuals that may occur over time
and further enhanced the expansion effect on financial security and access to mental
health services. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) report an
increase of 25% nationally in the population covered by Medicaid between February
2020 and January 2022.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr46-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
</sup> Therefore, we also examine whether there was an added effect of the ACA
Medicaid expansion on coverage in 2020-2021.</p><p>There is emerging evidence of the effects of the previous ACA Medicaid expansions on
the mental health of low-income individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two
studies report that Medicaid expansion nullified the negative effect of loss of work
on mental health.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Another study reported no statistically significant difference
in changes in days not in good mental health in the past 30&#8201;days during 2020 between
expansion and non-expansion states overall, although the study found a statistically
significant decline in this outcome for non-Hispanic Black individuals.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr47-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
</sup> That study, however, included individuals up to 138% of the FPL and did not
examine the effect separately for individuals below 100% of the FPL. In
non-expansion states, individuals within 100-138% of the FPL are eligible for
insurance marketplace subsidies, so including them in the sample may attenuate the
effect of the Medicaid expansion. Furthermore, that study did not evaluate the
effect on frequent mental distress characterized as experiencing 14 or more days of
poor mental health in the past month, an indicator of diagnosable depressive and
anxiety disorder.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr48-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</sup> Employing nationally representative data, we focus on individuals below 100%
FPL who are expected to benefit most from the Medicaid expansions (consider the
eligibility of those at 100%-138% FPL for subsidized marketplace insurance
coverage). We also evaluate potential heterogeneity across age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and whether children lived in the household.</p></sec><sec id="section2-00469580231166738"><title>Study Data and Methods</title><sec id="section3-00469580231166738"><title>Data and Sample</title><p>We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a
nationally representative cross-sectional telephone survey conducted annually by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state governments. The survey
is conducted in all states and the District of Columbia, and it is designed to
represent the non-institutionalized adult population in the United States. For
this study, we include BRFSS data from 2017 to 2021, from states that expanded
Medicaid by 2016 and states that had not expanded by 2021 to compare them on
changes in mental health over time, including from 2019 to 2021. We exclude
states that expanded Medicaid after 2016 (Idaho, Maine, Missouri, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Utah, and Virginia). Medicaid expansions by 2016 (including 4 states
and the District of Columbia that had full or near full expansions before 2014
but also adopted the ACA expansion in 2014) comprise the treated group. We
restrict the sample to low-income adults aged 18 to 64 with household incomes
below 100% of the FPL; as a reference, for a single individual in 2021, this
income was below $12&#8201;880.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr49-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
</sup> As income is reported in ranges in the BRFSS, we use the midpoints of the
income ranges and then assign to each individual income as a percentage of the
FPL considering household structure.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="bibr51-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> We exclude from the
sample respondents whose income is between 100% and 138% FPL since, as noted
above, they receive subsidies in non-expansion states to obtain insurance
through the health insurance marketplace. The analytical sample consisted of
128&#8201;074 adults surveyed between 2017 and 2021, with household incomes less than
100% FPL. There were 92&#8201;061 adults in Medicaid expansion states and 36&#8201;013
adults in non-expansion states.</p></sec><sec id="section4-00469580231166738"><title>Outcomes</title><p>BRFSS asks respondents about the number of days in the past 30 during which their
mental health was not good, including experiencing stress, depression, and
emotional problems. We use this measure of mental health as the main outcome. In
addition, we construct a binary indicator for frequent mental distress equal to
1 if the respondent had 14 or more days in poor mental health and 0 otherwise.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr52-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
</sup></p><p>We also examine whether coverage changed differentially in 2020 and 2021
(compared to 2019) between previously expanded states and non-expansion states
as a potential mechanism affecting mental health. As noted above, an added
(incremental) effect from the earlier Medicaid expansions on mental health
during the pandemic may develop without a greater increase in new enrollment in
expansion states. However, if expansion states had greater enrollment during the
pandemic, this may also contribute to an incremental effect on mental health
among the population of income-eligible adults. BRFSS asks whether respondents
have any form of health care coverage but does not ask about insurance type in

and childless adults (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00469580231166738" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Appendix Tables 10</ext-link>&#8211;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00469580231166738" ext-link-type="uri">13</ext-link>). However, the results using the ACS data should be
interpreted cautiously given the concern about non-response bias in the ACS in
2020 associated with the pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="bibr58-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section11-00469580231166738"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study evaluates whether previous Medicaid expansions had an added effect on
mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021-era. Specifically, the study
compares the mental health of low-income adults during those years of the pandemic
compared to before between states that had expanded Medicaid by 2016 and those that
had not expanded Medicaid by 2021 using an event study difference-in-differences
design and data from BRFSS. We find some evidence that the Medicaid expansion is
associated with better mental health, particularly among adults younger than
45&#8201;years, females, and non-Hispanic Black and other non-Hispanic, non-White
individuals. The pandemic and pandemic-related economic hardship had widespread
effects on the population, particularly among low-income, Black, women, and young
adult populations. The findings suggest that access to Medicaid coverage during an
economic and public health crisis may partially offset some of the negative
financial and health impacts of the pandemic, in this case, effects on mental
health.</p><p>The suggested benefit to mental health from higher Medicaid eligibility might result
from greater access to needed mental health treatments among those experiencing
mental health problems. Before the pandemic, the ACA Medicaid expansions had been
associated with an increase in mental health care utilization,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr59-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> access to

mental health care. Overall, outpatient services declined 60% in the early months of
the pandemic in 2020 as providers made practice adjustments and deferred
non-emergency services. Similarly, studies report a decline in initiation of mental
health medications during the pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="bibr63-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> However, low-income
individuals with Medicaid coverage in expansion states may have had greater access
to mental health services during the pandemic than individuals with similar income
in non-expansion states, including via telehealth care which some state Medicaid
programs expanded during the pandemic.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr64-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
</sup> Studies show that the utilization of telehealth for mental health conditions
increased during the pandemic,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr63-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
</sup> specifically among young adults,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr65-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>
</sup> females,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr66-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>
</sup> and individuals with serious mental illness.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr67-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>
</sup> In addition to greater access to services, there is also the possibility of
an added effect on financial security during the pandemic as noted above. Before the
pandemic, Medicaid expansion has been associated with a reduction in financial distress,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr68-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>
</sup> specifically among non-Hispanic Black individuals.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup> Because coverage protects against the financial shocks of unexpected
catastrophic medical events, it may confer &#8220;feelings of security&#8221; that may improve
mental health among individuals that are more likely to be impacted.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However,
BRFSS does not provide data to investigate these potential mechanisms, which we
leave for future research.</p><p>A related question is whether there was an incremental effect on Medicaid enrollment
in expansion states that would lead to an added benefit on mental health among the
income eligible population. Using multiple data sources-BRFSS, ACS, and the Centers
for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid enrollment data from 2017 to
2021, we find some evidence of an incremental effect on coverage and across some
subpopulation groups using the ACS data indicating that some of the added benefit to
mental health during the pandemic may have resulted from gains in access to Medicaid
coverage in expansion states. However, this result should be interpreted with
caution due to concerns about survey quality issues in 2020.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr57-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>
</sup> CMS reports an increase in Medicaid enrollment nationally during the
pandemic, although this appears to be largely driven by the FFCRA maintenance of
eligibility and continuous enrollment rather than new applicants.<sup><xref rid="bibr69-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="bibr70-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Also, our
study excludes states that expanded after 2016 including those that expanded during
the pandemic which may have experienced different effects on coverage.</p><p>The temporary FMAP with the continuous eligibility and enrollment provisions are
scheduled to end in 2023. Continuous eligibility and enrollment are scheduled to
expire on the 31st of March and the temporary FMAP will gradually phase out by
December 2023.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr71-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>
</sup> Reversing these provisions may lead to breaks in or loss of coverage if
individuals encounter barriers related to providing required documentation for
Medicaid redetermination.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr70-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>
</sup> Such coverage interruptions may reduce access to needed mental health
services. Reforms to facilitate enrollment and limit coverage interruptions for
eligible adults are needed not only during the pandemic but also after that,
especially if the pandemic has long-term effects on mental health.</p><p>This study has limitations. The measures for poor mental health in the BRFSS are
self-reported, leaving the possibility for measurement error. However, measurement
errors are unlikely to be associated with Medicaid expansion or to bias the
estimates. The pandemic may have disrupted data collection processes among states.
However, we do not expect that these changes will bias the results unless changes in
data collection during this period systematically differed between expansion and
non-expansion states. Another caveat is that even though studies using other data
report declining mental health conditions in the general population and among
subpopulation groups during the pandemic,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr72-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> mental health trends before
and after the pandemic using the BRFSS data seem to suggest less of an effect from
the pandemic on mental health in 2020 than other surveys. Depending on the data
source and timing of the survey, estimates of the pandemic&#8217;s effects on mental
health may differ in magnitude.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr73-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>
</sup> One study reported an increase in anxiety and depression in 2020 using the
Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) but
reported an opposite trend using BRFSS data (consistent with the trends in
descriptive <xref rid="fig1-00469580231166738" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr74-00469580231166738" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>
</sup> However, any potential bias in mental health trends during the pandemic in a
given survey would only influence the Medicaid expansion effects if this bias
differed between expansion and non-expansion states. Furthermore, there is a sharp
increase in days not in good mental health in 2021 in the BRFSS as noted above. In
any case, it would be important to replicate this study using other national
datasets, including the NHIS (which would require access to the restricted data
since state geocodes are not publicly available in that dataset). Since the HPS
started during the pandemic, it would not be possible to evaluate pre-trends between
expansion and non-expansion states in that dataset; therefore, its value for
understanding the Medicaid expansion effects in this particular case is limited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-00469580231166738"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We find that previous ACA Medicaid expansions are associated with an added benefit to
the mental health of individuals below 100% FPL in 2020-2021 during the COVID-19
pandemic. This association does not appear to result from a larger increase in new
enrollment in expansion states in that year compared to non-expansion states but
rather from prior and continuing coverage. This finding adds to the evidence of the
health benefits from the Medicaid expansions to income-eligible individuals,
including during public health and economic crises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section13-00469580231166738" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-00469580231166738" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-inq-10.1177_00469580231166738 &#8211; Supplemental material for
