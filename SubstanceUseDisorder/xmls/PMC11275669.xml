However, the extent of underlying shared causal variants, effector genes, and cellular contexts, remain unclear. We integrated 3D genomic datasets (high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C/Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq) from 59 diverse human cell types with recent GWAS summary statistics for alcohol (AUD), tobacco (TUD), opioid (OUD), and cannabis use disorder (CanUD). Using stratified LD regression, we determined the proportion of SNP heritability attributable to features in these cell types. We observed significant enrichments (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05) in 25 cell types. Heritability reached 4.2-fold enrichment for CanUD in iPSC-derived cortical neurons and 6-fold for AUD/TUD in neural progenitors, confirming their relevance for functional exploration. Additionally, pancreatic cell types, notably insulin-secreted beta cells, showed heritability enrichment for TUD (4.8-fold) and CanUD (5.8-fold), suggesting genomic overlap with metabolic processes.

SUDs pose a pervasive global health challenge, affecting individuals across diverse demographic groups and populations. SUD severity varies from mild to severe, and adverse outcomes generally correlate with the severity of the disorder. Alcohol, socially accepted and widely available, is one of the most commonly misused substances worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], leading to significant health, social, and economic losses. Excessive alcohol consumption is a major cause of premature death and disability, particularly among individuals aged 20&#8211;39, with about 13.5% of deaths in this group linked to alcohol. In the United States, 10.5% of individuals aged 12 and older suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD), with over 178,000 annual alcohol-related deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tobacco use disorder (TUD), affecting 22.3% of the global population, is the most prevalent substance use disorder, causing nearly 8 million preventable deaths annually due to cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, as well as various cancers [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) has surged over the past three decades, driven by prescription opioid misuse and illicit opioids like fentanyl, resulting in approximately 81,806 US opioid overdose deaths in 2022 [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cannabis use disorder (CanUD) has become more prominent with increasing legalization and is associated with morbidity, including certain cancers, cognitive impairments, and schizophrenia, contributing to societal problems that include reduced productivity and accidents [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="P27">SUDs show strong familial inheritance patterns [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with heritability estimates from twin studies for these disorders averaging ~50%. AUD heritability estimates range from 0.50 to 0.64 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and are higher for the diagnosis than traits like alcohol use initiation (0.30&#8211;0.40) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and frequency of consumption (0.37&#8211;0.47) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting a greater genetic influence on the progression to problematic use. TUD heritability ranges from 0.30 to 0.70, depending on the assessment method used [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

OUD heritability is around 50%, with 38% of variation attributed to opioid-specific genetic factors [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to genetic influences on specific SUDs [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], broader heritable factors influence SUD susceptibility in general [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Multiple large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SUDs conducted over the past ten years have yielded a growing number of genome-wide significant loci [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Multiple neural lineages demonstrated statistically significant &#964;* values for at least one trait. For example, iPSC-derived neurons exhibited positive &#964;* values for OUD and TUD, indicating a preferential localization of risk variants in their cREs. Likewise, hESC-derived hypothalamic neurons showed &#964;* enrichment for AUD, CanUD, and OUD. Among pancreatic cell types, particularly the alpha and beta cells, modest &#964;* enrichment was detected for TUD and CanUD, suggesting involvement of metabolic regulatory pathways. This was corroborated by similar enrichment in adipocytes and liver-derived cell types (e.g., HepG2, hepatocytes), aligning with the known metabolic consequences and systemic impacts of chronic substance use. In immune cells, dendritic cells (e.g., cDC_CD1c), monocytes, and various T-cell subsets (e.g., activated T-helper Th17, T-reg, Tr1) exhibited enriched &#964;* for multiple SUDs, especially AUD and CanUD.

All four SUDs shared enrichment in multiple neuronal lineages, indicating a common neurobiological basis to these traits. However, trait-specific differences also emerged, reflecting the relatively low genetic correlations among the four traits (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P54">The AUD enrichment was more evident in neural cell types, although several of these&#8212;e.g., conventional dendritic cells (cDC_CD1c), regulatory T-cells (Treg and Tr1), and monocytes&#8212;exhibited significant positive &#964;* in cRE-based annotations. In the neural component, iPSC-derived cortical neurons and neural progenitor cells and embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived hypothalamic NPCs and neurons showed significant positive enrichment in cREs and extended categories.

The metabolic cell types showed enhanced enrichment with the &#8220;not-cREs/Prom OCRs&#8221; regions. Notably, both pancreatic alpha and beta cells showed positive &#964;*, along with adipocytes and preadipocytes, likely reflecting a broader systemic involvement in addiction vulnerability, particularly of neuro-metabolic and endocrine pathways. This finding supports an integrative perspective on OUD as not purely a brain disorder, but one potentially influenced by genetic regulation of peripheral cell types that modulate physiological responses to opioid exposure. OUD also showed the greatest involvement of immune cell types, especially various T-helper cells, suggesting a multifaceted genetic architecture involving neuro-immune-metabolic axes. CanUD also showed strong involvement of immune cells and osteoblast cells but maintained the positive enrichment within the neural cell type.</p><p id="P57">The low overall heritability of CanUD (h2 = 0.015) and OUD (h2 = 0.028) likely explains why cREs appear to contribute disproportionately to per-SNP heritability in these traits. In these cases, cell-type-specific cREs may capture high-impact variants more effectively than the baseline model, resulting in higher enrichment estimates and stronger &#964;* effect sizes for these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S200"><title>Cortical neurons, neural progenitors, and pancreatic cells as key observations</title><p id="P58">Despite the observed diversity in patterns across distinct SUDs, several cell types consistently exhibited significant levels of enrichment.

Across all six cell types, enrichment and &#964;* were consistently highest for cREs &#177;500 bp, followed by cREs alone, with substantially lower values in promoter OCRs and not_cRE/promoter OCRs.

Using LDSC [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] to estimate global SNP-based genetic correlations (global r<sub>g</sub>) among SUDs and T2D, we observed that all positive genetic correlations were statistically significant, albeit moderate in magnitude (max global T2D-SUDs r<sub>g</sub>=0.03) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Individually, coronary heart disease and OUD yielded the highest correlation (global r<sub>g</sub>=0.25).</p><p id="P61">Because a global correlation represents an average of the shared association across the genome, it can be blunted by local correlations in opposing directions. Thus, we carried out local genetic correlation (local r<sub>g</sub>) analyses using LAVA [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] to detect genetic regions associated with each SUD and T2D. LAVA revealed that bivariate local r<sub>g</sub>s across 1,487 loci achieved significance after multiple correction (FDR &lt; 0.05). Of the significant correlations, 134 had 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the explained variance that included a value of 1, indicating that the local genetic signals for those traits are entirely shared, and that most were between CanUD and AUD (83 loci) (yellow bar in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

These findings convincingly demonstrate that individual genetic loci exhibit varying degrees of heritability and correlation, perhaps even more pronounced in diverse cellular contexts, and may not always be identifiable through genome-wide assessments.</p><p id="P64">Of the 1550 significantly correlated, 114 were between T2D and at least one SUD.

More than half of these loci (64 loci) were correlated between T2D and TUD (r<sub>g</sub>=0.04 &#8211; 0.6), 27 between T2D-AUD and 25 between T2D-CanUD with higher correlation (r<sub>g</sub>=0.05 &#8211; 0.8 and r<sub>g</sub>=0.1 &#8211; 0.8 respectively) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).

The first two principal components clearly differentiated iPSC-derived neurons and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), driven by genes crucial for neuronal development, signaling, and, for NPCs, chromatin regulation and cell cycle control. A fourth component characterized hESC-derived hypothalamic neurons, highlighting genes involved in membrane lipid composition, transporters, and neurotransmitter signaling (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>).

These involved ~1500 genes, 3648 promoter OCRs and ~2866 cREs. We used the <italic toggle="yes">Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO)</italic> framework to capture the major biological overlap among cell types. The combination of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq at 2 genomic annotations separated the cell types more granularly via an optimized 5-component model, with high correlations between 3 data blocks (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). Each component revealed distinct biological processes and key genes: from membrane dynamics in primary lineages (Component 1) to signaling pathways in hESC-derived neural progenitors (Component 2), and dopamine signaling in hypothalamic neurons (Component 3). Further, cytoskeletal function defined iPSC-derived neural progenitors (Component 4), while membrane/lipid metabolism distinguished pancreatic alpha and beta cells (Component 5) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). This highlights that the molecular signatures differentiating these cell types are rooted in core biological processes essential for their unique identities and functions.</p><p id="P69">Mapping the cRE sets to the shared biology of SUDs and T2D at each of 114 loci revealed substance-specific functional enrichments (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). The AUD-T2D gene set shows enrichment in functions such as alcohol dehydrogenase activity, NAD-retinol dehydrogenase activity, and various carboxypeptidase activities, suggesting potential links between alcohol metabolism, other metabolic processes, and protein modification. The TUD-T2D gene set is associated with functions that include microtubule and tubulin binding, outward rectifier potassium channel activity, and symporter and secondary active transmembrane transporter activity, indicating the involvement of cytoskeletal dynamics, ion transport, and broader transmembrane transport mechanisms in the TUD-T2D context. The CanUD-T2D gene set demonstrates enrichment in functions such as ATP-dependent diacylglycerol kinase activity, mRNA binding (5&#8217;-UTR and 3&#8217;-UTR), and structural constituent of eye lens, pointing towards roles in lipid metabolism, gene regulation at the mRNA level, and potentially ocular complications in individuals with CanUD and T2D. These findings underscore the biological heterogeneity underlying SUD-T2D comorbidities and emphasize the need for substance-specific approaches to research and treatment efforts.</p><p id="P70">Our analysis aimed to identify molecular drivers of multi-omic patterns and cell type relationships within disease-associated loci. Despite advanced analytic approaches, clear separation of neural and pancreatic cell types proved challenging, revealing extensive overlap in their genetic and chromatin landscapes. While some analyses highlighted cell-type-specific drivers related to neuronal development, signaling, or metabolic functions, the overall picture points to a profound shared biological basis, especially within the 114 loci linked to both T2D and SUDs. This significant overlap suggests common underlying genetic programs and regulatory mechanisms contribute to the complex interplay between metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting shared pathways active in pancreatic beta cells and neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P71">We sought to identify cellular contexts that mediate the genetic etiology of SUDs by examining enrichment patterns of epigenetic features across diverse cell types. While annotating SNPs based on proximity to trait-associated genes seems intuitive, more extensive analysis is required to pinpoint the effector mechanisms. Because cell-type-specific eQTL mapping remains technically challenging and often tags genes with simpler regulation and less functional relevance [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], we used SEG-based LDSC as a more tractable control. Although limited by broad SNP windows that dilute signal specificity, this approach provides a practical baseline for assessing cell-type relevance.</p><p id="P72">Our approach, which integrated GWAS summary statistics with ATAC-seq and promoter Capture C/Hi-C data, focusing on experimentally defined regulatory regions specific to certain cell types, allows for testing/generating more direct hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms. Utilizing LD score regression to quantify polygenic effects and confounding factors, we assessed the contribution of SNP-based heritability to SUD pathogenesis. The observed positive heritability enrichment across various open chromatin features spanning multiple cell types revealed the involvement of metabolic and neural systems.</p><p id="P73">Within our repertoire of cell types, we hypothesized that most of the GWAS signals would reside in cREs or gene promoters, as shown previously [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. By partitioning SUD heritability onto cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility maps, we directly tested the hypothesis that genetic variants falling within regions actively regulating gene expression <italic toggle="yes">in specific cell types</italic> contribute disproportionately to SUD risk. This approach simultaneously implicates cell types and highlights the importance of their active regulatory landscapes. Although GWAS SNPs are broadly enriched in regulatory elements, the critical insight gained from our approach is cell-type specificity. While enrichment in &#8220;open chromatin&#8221; is to be expected, identifying which specific cell types&#8217; open chromatin regions are disproportionately enriched for SUD heritability deepens our understanding by pinpointing the cellular contexts where regulatory dysregulation likely contributes to SUD pathology. The enrichment patterns observed for AUD and TUD generally aligned with this. However, for CanUD and OUD, the GWAS signals exhibited a distinct pattern not fully captured by our cREs. This complexity makes it challenging to identify and characterize all relevant regulatory elements contributing to the susceptibility to these disorders. The presumed temporal nature of open chromatin regions within a given cell type likely also contributes to less observed enrichment within certain cell type cREs [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p id="P74">Notably, cortical neurons and pancreatic cells were consistently enriched across all OCR categories for all SUDs, suggesting a potentially crucial role for them in the pathophysiology of SUDs. In particular, the enrichment of cortical neurons and neural progenitor cells in SUDs aligns with accumulating evidence that implicates these cell types in the neurobiology of addiction [<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p><p id="P75">The implicated involvement of pancreatic cells in SUDs represents a novel and intriguing insight into their pathology, underscoring the interplay between metabolic regulation and addictive behaviors. Chronic exposure to substances like alcohol, opioids, and cannabinoids can disrupt pancreatic function, leading to dysregulated glucose metabolism and increased risk of metabolic disorders like diabetes [<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Chronic alcohol consumption increases risk of pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, likely due to the toxic effects of alcohol on pancreatic tissue. However, an individual&#8217;s genetic predisposition can influence the susceptibility of their pancreatic tissue to alcohol-induced toxicity, making them more vulnerable to these diseases. Alcohol-induced pancreatic damage can cause beta-cell dysfunction, impair insulin secretion, and dysregulate glucagon secretion, contributing to metabolic abnormalities and the development of diabetes [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Opioid drugs exert direct effects on pancreatic alpha and beta cells, e.g., by modulating insulin and glucagon secretion, potentially contributing to the glucose dysregulation and metabolic disturbances observed in opioid users [<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Endocannabinoid receptors, including cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), are expressed in pancreatic alpha and beta cells, suggesting a direct influence of cannabinoids on pancreatic function. The activation of CB1 receptors can impair insulin secretion from beta cells and stimulate glucagon release from alpha cells, thereby also implicating the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of pancreatic hormone secretion and glucose metabolism [<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. A recent study also uncovered a direct link between pancreatic cells and nicotine use, mediated by the transcription factor TCF7L2, the gene for which was implicated in T2D through GWAS [<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The study showed that TCF7L2 regulates nicotine intake by modulating nicotinic receptors in the habenula, a brain region involved in stress responses. This regulation influences blood glucose levels through signaling via the autonomic nervous system to the pancreas, with chronic nicotine use disrupting normal glucose regulation.</p><p id="P76">Consistent with these findings, pancreatic beta cells share features with the brain, including a common set of expressed genes, which suggests an evolutionary link between the two [<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. During pancreatic organogenesis, the depression of polycomb proteins enables beta cells to present with a neuronal gene expression program [<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], with the overall beta cells&#8217; gene expression pattern and chromatin marks being closer to neuronal tissue types than other tissues. Insulin-producing neurons precede beta cells phylogenetically, with rodents, human (<italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>), and most invertebrates having neurons that produce insulin to manage blood glucose levels [<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Given the shared features of pancreatic beta cells and neurons that extend from transcription to post-transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], understanding the interactions between the brain and pancreas could aid in understanding the relationship between addiction and metabolic health.</p><p id="P77">Recognizing SUDs and T2D as potentially interconnected disorders with shared biological mechanisms opens avenues for more integrated and holistic therapeutic approaches. Instead of treating these conditions in silos, a more effective paradigm might involve screening individuals with one condition for the presence of the other and developing treatment plans that address the comorbidity. The insights gained from our study, particularly regarding the role of pancreatic cells and metabolic pathways, point towards promising new therapeutic targets. Among these, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists stand out as a class of drugs with significant potential. Already well-established for their efficacy in managing T2D by improving glycemic control, promoting weight loss, and offering cardiovascular benefits, GLP-1 agonists exert their effects by mimicking the action of the naturally occurring GLP-1 hormone [<xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This hormone plays a crucial role in glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, suppressing glucagon release, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Emerging research further suggests a potential role for GLP-1 agonists in the treatment of SUDs [<xref rid="R105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>, <xref rid="R106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in brain regions involved in reward processing and addiction, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens [<xref rid="R107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, <xref rid="R108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 agonists can modulate dopaminergic signaling in these areas, leading to reduced drug-seeking behavior and decreased intake of substances like alcohol, nicotine, and even opioids [<xref rid="R109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. While clinical trials investigating the direct use of GLP-1 agonists for SUD treatment are still in early phases, the existing data and biological rationale are compelling. The application of GLP-1 agonists in individuals with comorbid SUDs and T2D or obesity could offer a dual therapeutic benefit, simultaneously addressing metabolic dysregulation and potentially reducing substance use and craving. Their established safety profile and widespread use in T2D and obesity make them an attractive option for repurposing in this context. In a recent placebo-controlled trial, the GLP-1 receptor antagonist, semaglutide&#8212;a drug approved for treating obesity and T2D&#8212;significantly reduced heavy drinking in individuals with AUD. Studies of other incretin drugs like semaglutide are currently underway [<xref rid="R112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which GLP-1 agonists influence addictive behaviors and to determine their efficacy and optimal use in diverse SUD populations, particularly in those with co-occurring metabolic conditions.</p><p id="P78">Our findings in immune cell types are consistent with numerous studies that have shown the influence of SUDs on the immune response system and associated cell types. For instance, there are immunomodulatory effects of chronic alcohol consumption, including alterations in cytokine production, heightened CNS inflammation, impaired immune cell function, and increased susceptibility to infection [<xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>].</p><p id="P79">In conclusion, by elucidating relevant regulatory regions across various cell types, we gained insight into the genetic underpinnings of SUDs. Our study has indicated in which specific cellular environments the genetic susceptibility to SUDs lies. These observations warrant further research aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of these disorders in specific cellular contexts. This could offer new avenues to advance our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of SUDs and aid in the development of more effective targeted interventions. The potential for a single class of medication to positively impact both SUDs and T2D underscores the value of understanding the shared biological underpinnings of these complex disorders, as revealed by integrative genomics approaches like the one employed in our study. This could pave the way for more effective, targeted, and integrated interventions for individuals struggling with both SUDs and metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplement 1</label><caption><p id="P86"><bold>Figure S1.
