During home visits, nurses support mothers to make choices about healthy pregnancies, improving child development, and fulfilling their own aspirations and ambitions. Evidence is needed of the wider effects of the FNP, including for mothers not enrolled in the programme (who might experience unintended effects). We evaluated child and maternal outcomes for all eligible mothers giving birth before, during, and after the period in which FNP was active in local areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We created a linked cohort of 237,185 eligible mothers, aged 13-19, who gave birth between April 2010 and March 2019, and who had a first antenatal booking appointment (or a date of 28 completed weeks of gestation, if missing) when FNP was active in their area. We used administrative hospital data to identify unplanned maternal/child hospitalisations up to 2 years after birth for children born and mothers delivering before, during and after FNP was active. Generalised linear models were used to adjust for background regional time trends, maternal characteristics, and clustering of outcomes within residential areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>We found no evidence of differences in unplanned hospital admissions for children born during the FNP period (36.9% versus 36.0%, relative risk [RR] 1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.02), or after FNP was active (37.1%, RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.95-1.06), compared with those born before FNP was active. There was no evidence of differences in child admissions for maltreatment/injury-related diagnoses or for maternal admissions for adversity-related diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Child and maternal outcomes were similar before, during and after FNP active periods, suggesting that the FNP did not have a wider impact on outcomes in all eligible mothers, including those not participating in the FNP.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001923</institution-id><institution>Health Services Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR 17/99/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3418-2856</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Harron</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019256</institution-id><institution>NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health and Care Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Children and Families Policy Research Unit</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by funding from NIHR Health Services Delivery &amp; Research (17/99/19), and the authors were in part supported by the NIHR through the Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre and the NIHR Children and Families Policy Research Unit and Senior Investigator award for RG.

Qualitative research suggests that professionals are concerned about the licensed nature of FNP and not being able to share freely with wider health visiting colleagues or to use it to change practice across services.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Despite this, there may still be benefits to other services, for example if trained family nurses take on other roles and disseminate trauma-informed approaches, either while the FNP is being delivered, or after it has stopped being delivered in a local area. Indeed, evidence from the Building Blocks trial demonstrated that health visitors in the control arm conducted many more visits (~16) than would typically have been delivered in usual care prior to the trial.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0320810.t001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0320810.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Examples of potential benefits and disadvantages of the Family Nurse Partnership to the wider area, effecting both eligible but non-participating mothers and ineligible mothers.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0320810.t001g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0320810.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Potential benefits</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Potential disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Staffing</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attracts more expert nurses to frontline community work</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drains capacity from business-as-usual health visiting</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Knowledge of practice</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sharing of learning, e.g., on trauma-informed approaches</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Confusion about/ restriction of the most appropriate tools to use for a specific population</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Connection/displacement of related services</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shared knowledge of relevant services, e.g., midwifery, social care, mental health, early day care</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eligible mothers might be assumed to be receiving support from the FNP and therefore may be less likely to be referred to additional services; potential reductions in funding to other services due to the expense of commissioning FNP</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Secondly, whilst research using linked administrative data on the whole population of mothers participating in the FNP has the potential to provide evidence of the effect of the programme on a much larger scale than possible within a randomised trial, such observational studies face a number of challenges.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The main challenge is to overcome the confounding by indication that is inherent in study designs comparing mothers who are and are not enrolled in the programme (since those who are enrolled are a highly selected population).[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The lack of effect observed in an observational study using linked administrative data for all FNP participants between 2010-2019 in England may be a consequence of such residual confounding.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Evaluating the effect of the FNP on all eligible mothers would overcome the issues of residual confounding in earlier studies, and would also provide an insight into the overall effect of the programme, balancing potential positive spillover effects and unintended negative effects on those who are not enrolled.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We therefore aimed to estimate the wider effects of the FNP by evaluating child and maternal healthcare outcomes for all eligible mothers, including those who were not enrolled in the FNP, to determine whether the whole population of adolescent mothers were overall better or worse off during periods in which the FNP was active in each area, compared to before and after.

Previous analysis of the FNP data has shown that rates of any unplanned admissions and unplanned admissions for injury or maltreatment-related diagnoses in the child and unplanned admissions for adversity in the mother were slightly increased in mothers participating in the FNP, but that FNP mothers were less likely to have a subsequent delivery within 18 months of the index birth than those not enrolled.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>We therefore evaluated unplanned hospital admissions for children and mothers up to two years after birth, and specifically those with codes indicating injury or maltreatment-related diagnoses for the child, or adversity-related diagnosis (including substance misuse, self-harm or violence) for the mother. We created binary variables according to whether each child or mother had one or more admissions captured in HES using published code lists (<xref rid="pone.0320810.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0320810.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).

We found no differences in child or maternal outcomes before, during or after the period in which the FNP was offered in the mothers&#8217; residential area. This finding suggests no overall harm and no detectable benefit on the outcomes measured during the time in which FNP was offered compared to other periods. Our findings add to the evidence base for the FNP in England, which demonstrate little evidence of an effect of the FNP on child maltreatment outcomes in the medium term, but some evidence of improved school readiness associated with FNP participation.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Strengths of our study include the large sample size representing the whole population of mothers aged 13-19 eligible for the FNP in England, and the use of linked information on health, education and children&#8217;s social care. A first limitation is the possibility of time-varying confounding due to the before/during/after design. However, we accounted for calendar time and used interaction terms to identify any changes over time. We also evaluated outcomes for mothers in the period after enrolment had ended. A second limitation is that we were only able to control for the fairly crude maternal risk factors associated with enrolment in the FNP that were captured in the administrative data. We therefore cannot rule out unmeasured confounding, since we are comparing different populations of mothers across time and geography. A third limitation is that we used relatively crude outcome measures of adversity-related unplanned hospital admissions, which may not capture benefits of FNP intervention for improved parenting. FNP practitioners report that mothers participating in the programme develop more reflective parenting and awareness of their child&#8217;s needs: better measures of maternal well-being, confidence, mental health, parent&#8211;child interaction and child behaviour would allow us to understand more nuanced effects of the programme not routinely captured in administrative data. Finally, we were unable to account for the many other services that would have been available to adolescent mothers during each time period.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Further research could explore the extent to which are findings are replicable in other settings, e.g., in rural communities.</p><p>As rates of adolescent pregnancies have fallen over recent decades, adolescents who do become pregnant become a more selected population with a variety of needs (including, for example, appropriate social care involvement and support for mental health conditions) who are at risk of adverse outcomes for themselves and their children.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The FNP is one of the most promising interventions to support these mothers, but is only offered to a selected population of those who are eligible. We still do not know whether removing support for these mothers could lead to worse outcomes, taking into account increasing social disadvantage and the pressure on other services as a result of widespread health visitor shortages.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] More needs to be done to understand which elements of intensive interventions are most effective, for whom and at which time points, and how to balance the use of highly intensive services available to small groups, with universal services that support all adolescent mothers.</p><p>Decisions about commissioning the Family Nurse Partnership need to weigh i) the strong local support for FNP, the benefits highlighted by qualitative research, and the lack of harms to the eligible population of adolescent mothers overall,[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with ii) the lack of benefits observed for primary outcomes in the randomised controlled trials and observational evaluations of FNP, and the costs associated with offering this programme to a selected population of mothers (&#163;1812 more than usual care per participant).[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Most of the evidence of beneficial effects of the FNP comes from three USA trials of the Nurse Family Partnership, which showed mixed but overall positive impacts on child health and development outcomes and some maternal outcomes, along with a more recent trial in The Netherlands.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] A more detailed synthesis of evidence can be found elsewhere.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In contrast, the Building Blocks trial in England showed no evidence of impact of FNP on most child outcomes, with the exception of some cognitive outcomes.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] These differences are likely due in part to differences in usual care contexts between different countries (e.g., better overall access to services for adolescent mothers in England who are not enrolled in FNP. Another likely contributing factor is the differences in eligibility criteria for FNP in England compared with other countries. Young age is the main eligibility criteria for FNP in England, based on the ease of identifying the youngest adolescent mothers, associations between adolescent motherhood and social adversity, disrupted education and employment, and other factors contributing to poor birth and health outcomes among their children.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] In contrast, the USA included additional socioeconomic criteria for enrolment, such as unemployment, low educational level or low income.[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] As a result, the population of young mothers enrolled in trials in other countries are a more selected and vulnerable group than in England, who may stand to benefit more from the FNP (as evidenced by greater effectiveness in socioeconomically deprived groups demonstrated in the USA trials).[<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320810.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</p><p>Our analysis provides a first step in considering the wider impact of the FNP, including on those not enrolled, when making decisions about commissioning this targeted intervention. Further research is also needed to understand whether other effects are present, where for example the FNP might have an effect on the subsequent children born to mothers who were enrolled in the FNP with their first child.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0320810.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>

While it addresses interesting issues, it fails to include fundamental information for readers to have in interpreting the results of this study:</p><p>1. FNP is a licensed program in which those licensed to deliver it are committed to protecting the licensed material. Thus, spill-over effects are not likely to be discerned, although local areas may choose to visit families in need more frequently than through usual health visiting and midwifery, and to use the general approach employed by FNP nurses during later periods of care, when FNP was not delivered.</p><p>2. It would be useful to examine the frequency of health-visiting and midwifery contacts before, during, and after FNP was delivered in specific areas. That would be useful data to use in this report, if the data are available. Evidence from the BB0-2 report indicated that health-visitors paid many more visits (~16) to the control group during the trial-period1 than the maximum typically delivered to families by health visitors prior to the trial (a maximum of 3). It&#8217;s not clear how many visits were paid to families with greater needs. Are health visitors and midwives currently visiting families in need today than before FNP went into effect?</p><p>3. The reader needs to see the degree to which those cases used in the final analyses were comparable on &#8220;baseline&#8221; characteristics used for comparing FNP enrollees to those adolescent mothers not enrolled, like the authors of this paper reported in a BMJ report published earlier this year. For a study like this one, these critical data points are needed by reviewers in the main body of the report to discern clearly which groups are being compared and the degree to which they were comparable.</p><p>4. The authors should acknowledge explicitly that FNP today focuses on those with heightened needs, given that the Cardiff trial results led to efforts on the part of FNP leaders to target the program on those with greater needs. Please search for the Adapt report.</p><p>5. Greater specification of the differences between those who received FNP and the rest of the population &lt; 20Y will be important to report toward the beginning of this manuscript.</p><p>6. Note that a German trial of this program focused on those with overlapping needs but combined two versions of the program in the original reports: one delivered by midwives throughout the entire program period (pregnancy through child-age 2 &#8211; the Continuous model, and a second in which it was delivered by midwives from pregnancy through 6-months postpartum and then by social workers through child-age 2 - the tandem model. Early reports that combined these two models produced equivocal results.2 Evidence is now accumulating that the version of the program delivered by midwives continuously is beginning to show that the midwife-only model is superior to the tandem model. 3 The point is that the German replicators focused on those with overlapping needs predictive of child maltreatment. The same can be said about trials of this program conducted in the Netherlands4-6 and British Columbia,7 which again focused on those with overlapping needs, not simply maternal age &lt;20. Note that the Netherlands and German trials were conducted in countries with extensive health and social care systems &#8211; like the UK.</p><p>7. It&#8217;s thus not surprising that FNP showed no evidence of beneficial carry-over effects, given the absence of detailed data on those served by FNP and the lack of comparability of those included in the comparison group. While the authors have made statistical adjustments using data available through data-linkage, the sources of such data are crude and do not account for unmeasured differences.</p><p>8. Moreover, questions should be raised about the choice of outcomes in this study: a) unplanned hospitalizations through child-age two, b) differences in child admissions for maltreatment/injury-related diagnoses and c) maternal admissions for adversity-related diagnoses. FNP nurses encourage parents to take their children to A&amp;E to rule out internal injuries following an accident, and for mothers to do the same for themselves -- which will increase these types of admissions on the part of FNP-visited families. A better measure of child functioning (related to child maltreatment) is the number of days children were hospitalized with injuries, which was found to distinguish treatment and control groups in the US Memphis8 and the Canadian BC trials,7 which reflects injury severity, and which is less susceptible to FNP-visited families using GP and A&amp;E care to protect their children&#8217;s health.</p><p>9. These issues should be addressed in the introduction of the manuscript and the discussion.</p><p>10. Moreover, the introduction of the manuscript should include the school-readiness finding from the BB2-6 report as well as the maternally reported language effects from BB0-2.</p><p>11. The rest of the manuscript depends upon the starting point &#8211; that is addressing the differences between those enrolled in the program and the rest of the population &lt;20Y in comparing FNP enrollees to the rest of the populations within areas that delivered FNP.</p><p>12. Finally, the manuscript needs a careful editorial review for spelling and grammar.</p><p>References</p><p>1. Robling, M., Bekkers, M. J., Bell, K., Butler, C.

</p><p>Dear Editors</p><p>Thank you for the additional reviews on our manuscript. The final reviewer had two main points, which we have responded to below.</p><p>Comment 1: Overall, the article presents its methodology and study limitations clearly. This study reports rather unoptimistic findings: there is no evidence of differences in unplanned hospital admissions between children born during the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) period, those born after FNP was implemented, and those born before FNP started. Although I initially found it unclear why unplanned hospital admissions were chosen as the primary outcome, the authors explained in the methods section that this decision was based on findings from a previous study, which makes sense.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this positive feedback.</p><p>To be honest, I am impressed by the authors' courage in presenting such disappointing data regarding the FNP program. Therefore, I believe the discussion section could be more in-depth or inspiring, which might enhance the readability of the article. For example, the second paragraph of the introduction mentions that the FNP program implemented in the United States was effective, making one curious about the differences in implementation between the UK and the US that might have led to the variation in outcomes. Additionally, I am curious about incorporating cost-effectiveness data, which might help readers assess the feasibility of the FNP program.</p><p>Response: We agree that we could give more information in the discussion section about why there are differences in the evidence on the effectiveness of the FNP in the US and the UK, and have now amended the text. Although looking at cost-effectiveness is beyond the scope of this study, we also now refer to a cost-effectiveness study of the FNP in England, for context.</p><p>We hope that these changes satisfy the reviewer and the editors, but welcome any further feedback.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Katie Harron</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0320810.s009" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewers R2.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0320810.s009.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0320810.r006" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0320810.r006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Chen</surname><given-names initials="MH">Mu-Hong</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2025 Mu-Hong Chen</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Mu-Hong Chen</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0320810" id="rel-obj006" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

Several major modifications make the new discussion section more sophisticated and applicable.&#160;In particular, international comparisons help explain why FNP affects vary among countries.
