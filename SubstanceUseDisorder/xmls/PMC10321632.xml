Over a median follow-up of 9 years (IQR 5&#8211;14) and maximum follow-up of 20 years, there were 75,807 deaths. The risk of all-cause mortality was similar across a wide range of BMI categories: compared to BMI of 22.5&#8211;24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the adjusted HR was 0.95 [95% CI 0.92, 0.98] for BMI of 25.0&#8211;27.4 and 0.93 [0.90, 0.96] for BMI of 27.5&#8211;29.9. These results persisted after restriction to healthy never-smokers and exclusion of subjects who died within the first two years of follow-up. A 21&#8211;108% increased mortality risk was seen for BMI &#8805;30. Older adults showed no significant increase in mortality between BMI of 22.5 and 34.9, while in younger adults this lack of increase was limited to the BMI range of 22.5 to 27.4.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The risk of all-cause mortality was elevated by 21&#8211;108% among participants with BMI &#8805;30.

It is well-established that elevated BMI can contribute to several cardio-metabolic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, which are among the leading causes of premature death in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have examined the association between BMI and mortality in the general U.S. population, including the landmark Cancer Prevention Study I and II cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and other National Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium studies [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, in the most comprehensive pooled analysis of U.S. data to date, the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration conducted a participant-level meta-analysis of data from 45 cohort studies from the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, epidemiologic evidence regarding the association between BMI and all-cause mortality has been inconsistent, especially with regards to overweight and class I obese individuals, with some meta-analyses demonstrating similar or lower risk of all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and others finding significantly elevated mortality risk in individuals with BMI &gt;25 [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, most U.S. studies to date have used data from the 1960s through the 1990s and have included predominantly non-Hispanic White men and women. In contrast, the contemporary U.S. population: (1) has a substantially different BMI distribution, with mean BMI having risen by more than 2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in both men and women since the 1970s [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and increasing skewness towards obese-range BMIs [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; (2) has seen &gt;10 year increases in life expectancy both overall and among obese individuals [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; (3) is more racially and ethnically diverse, with the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites decreasing from 84% in 1990 to 58% in 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; and (4) has seen improvements in efficacy and access to treatment strategies for obesity-related conditions [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All of these factors may alter the association between BMI and mortality. Of the few studies using more contemporary populations [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], they were either restricted by small sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] limiting analysis in racial and gender subgroups, and/or only rudimentarily characterized the dose-response relationship between BMI and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, studies inconsistently adjusted for methodologic bias including confounding by illness-related weight loss, collider bias (e.g. the concept that conditioning on obesity-related disease may distort associations between risk factors like BMI and diet and subsequently bias downstream associations), and the healthy person effect (e.g. selection bias that may be introduced when selecting participants of different BMI groups who may otherwise be healthy) [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>To address this gap, we examined the association between BMI and all-cause mortality in the general U.S. population using nationally representative data from the 1999&#8211;2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data sources and study population</title><p>The NHIS is a nationally representative survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, following a multi-stage, probability design from 1999&#8211;2018.

To allow for comparability with previous studies and examination of non-linear associations, BMI was classified into 9 categories, consistent with the large, pooled analysis of National Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium studies: &lt;18.5, 18.5&#8211;19.9, 20.0&#8211;22.4, 22.5&#8211;24.9, 25&#8211;27.4, 27.5&#8211;29.9, 30.0&#8211;34.9, 35.0&#8211;39.9, &#8805;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>All-cause mortality was determined from the U.S. National Death Index (NDI). The 1999&#8211;2018 NHIS was linked by the National Center for Health Statistics to the NDI up to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019 via patient unique identifiers [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>We selected covariates a priori based on clinical knowledge and previous studies of BMI and mortality. These included demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), socio-behavioral factors (education, marital status, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, insurance coverage, region of residence, citizenship status), comorbidities (self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, non-skin cancer or melanoma, COPD, current asthma, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or functional limitations), and healthcare utilization factors (doctor&#8217;s visit in the past 12 months, mental health visit in the past 12 months). Covariate categorizations are provided in the supplement (Extended Supplementary Methods). Questionnaire protocols and quality control procedures for each covariate are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>NHIS baseline characteristics were compared across the 9 specified BMI categories. To determine the association between BMI and all-cause mortality, we used Cox proportional hazard models (proportionality assumption verified using Schoenfeld residual plots), adjusting for covariates selected a priori and using BMI of 22.5&#8211;24.9 as the reference category. As only the year and quarter were available for death date and interview date, we used the difference between the year and quarter of the death date or end-of-follow-up and survey interview year and quarter to calculate time-to-event. Participants who died or reached the end of follow-up were censored. Cox models were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, insurance coverage, region of residence, and citizenship status. Consistent with prior studies, we did not adjust for comorbidities in the main analysis, as they could be on the causal pathway between BMI and mortality or potential colliders for BMI and unmeasured confounders [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<bold>S1 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0287218.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref></bold>). However, we performed a sensitivity analysis adjusting for metabolic syndrome criteria and additionally excluding participants with any reported chronic disease to explore the independent relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality.</p><p>To understand the association between BMI and mortality in specific populations, we conducted analyses in women aged &lt;65, women &#8805;65, men &lt;65, and men &#8805;65, as prior studies have suggested weaker BMI-mortality associations in women and older adults. We also performed analyses stratified by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic), as different ethnic groups exhibit differences in BMI distributions and associations with morbidity. We further conducted analyses among subgroups of disease-free individuals, utilizing different definitions of disease: minor morbidity, defined as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, non-skin cancer except melanoma, COPD, current asthma, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or functional limitations; and major morbidity, defined via Berrington de Gonzalez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and non-skin cancer or melanoma.</p><p>We also conducted analyses restricted to healthy never-smokers (no self-reported cardiovascular disease or non-skin cancer or melanoma) to address confounding by major chronic disease and smoking [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To examine the potential impact of reverse causality (i.e. confounding by illness-related weight loss), we conducted analyses limited to participants who did not die within the first two years of follow-up. Although some prior meta-analyses [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have excluded the first five years of follow-up, there has been concern that such exclusions would lead to significant selection bias as a sizeable proportion of the study population would be excluded, without significant benefit in reducing reverse causality [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding the first five years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Sensitivity analyses using NHANES</title><p>Limitations of the NHIS include use of self-reported data and lack of laboratory data and information on waist circumference, change in weight over time, and other potential confounding variables including additional comorbidities and dietary factors. To address these limitations, we estimated associations between BMI and all-cause mortality in the 1999&#8211;2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) stratified by waist circumference, weight change, and using alternate definitions to define healthy individuals. Further information about the NHANES study population can be found elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and in the supplement.</p><p>Both NHIS and NHANES analyses utilized weights to produce nationally representative estimates and to account for oversampling of certain groups including older adults and members of ethnic minorities. All analyses also accounted for the complex survey design with strata and cluster variables using a traditional Taylor linearization approach to obtain accurate variance estimates. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>The study sample included 554,332 adults (mean age 46 years, 50% female, 69% non-Hispanic White, 12% non-Hispanic Black, 42% smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their life).

Our results also contrast with the two largest landmark U.S. cohort studies, the NIH-AARP cohort [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (data from 1995&#8211;2005) and the Cancer Prevention Study II (1982&#8211;1996) [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], both of which found 4&#8211;28% increased risk of mortality among BMI groups &#8805;25. Three large meta-analyses on BMI and all-cause mortality have been conducted in the past decade, utilizing studies from the 1960s through the 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. North American results were largely driven by the aforementioned Cancer Prevention Study II and NIH-AARP cohorts. Our findings were similar to those from a meta-analysis by Flegal et al. [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (data through 2012) and also to a representative NHANES study with data through the year 2000 [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which both found similar or lower mortality risk for overweight BMI, although these studies used different reference BMI categories and confounding adjustments. As our statistical approach is similar to the landmark U.S. studies employing the bias adjustments recommended by the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, the contrasting results are not likely to be explained by methodological differences.</p><p>In subgroup analyses, we found that older adults (&#8805;65 years) demonstrated a wider range of minimally changed mortality risk than younger adults. In the NIH-AARP study, among 66&#8211;70-year-olds, mortality risk was similar for BMI of 25.0&#8211;26.4 compared to a reference of 23.5&#8211;24.9. However, they found increased risk of mortality for BMI &#8805;26.5 in both men and women [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, a recent 2014 meta-analysis by Winter et al. showed that among adults aged &#8805;65 worldwide, BMI through 30.0 was associated with 4&#8211;9% decreased mortality risk compared to a reference of 23.0&#8211;23.9 [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although our findings were in the same direction, they were not statistically significant (as were those of Winter et al.), likely because we performed rigorous adjustments and included a broader reference of 22.5&#8211;24.9, which may have captured a healthier reference population. Nonetheless, these cohorts, other studies in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and our findings have consistently shown no significantly different mortality risk for overweight-range BMI. Among younger adults, while BMI of 25&#8211;27.4 was not associated with increased mortality, there was nearly 20% higher mortality risk for young adults with a BMI of 27.5&#8211;29.9, which is consistent with effect measures from the pooled analysis of the National Cancer Cohort Consortium.</p><p>There are several plausible reasons why participants with higher BMI (25.0&#8211;34.9) may have all-cause mortality risk similar to those with conventionally normal BMI (18.5&#8211;24.9): (1) overweight individuals may have survival advantages in various adverse circumstances, such as critical illness, major morbidities, and severe infection [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that are not offset by the increased risk of chronic metabolic diseases; (2) overweight individuals without disease may be metabolically healthy and have a more favorable body composition consisting of higher lean mass [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, BMI alone may be insufficient in classifying high-risk adiposity&#8211;both waist circumference [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and weight change over time can modify BMI-mortality associations, as seen in our NHANES findings; (3) lean individuals who develop diseases such as hypertension or diabetes may have more aggressive or treatment-resistant disease, whereas overweight or obese individuals who develop such conditions may be able to manage or even reverse disease with weight loss strategies [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; (4) finally, the U.S. population has become much more diverse, with greater representation of ethnic minorities and older adults in our cohort with potentially different body compositions [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] compared to previous cohorts. In fact, one limitation of prior U.S. studies is a lack of racial diversity and representativeness of the changing demographic landscape. Our study included &gt;100,000 minority adults, who exhibited lower mortality risk at overweight and obese BMIs compared to non-Hispanic White adults. This finding is consistent with data from Calle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and with subgroup analyses from other large U.S. cohort studies [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, all study data in the NHIS, including BMI, was self-reported, potentially leading to misclassification [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, the majority of prior landmark studies have used self-reported data and have also found high correlations between findings using measured vs. self-reported BMI [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Further, our NHANES results, which used measured BMI, were largely similar to those from the NHIS. Second, our study had shorter follow-up than some previous studies and thus may underestimate risk of mortality in higher-BMI groups due to residual effects of occult disease. Despite the shorter follow-up, we were able to exclude early deaths without greatly compromising sample size, and more than 40% of our study participants had at least ten years of follow-up. Third, in our NHIS analysis, we analyzed BMI from a single time point. While this practice is standard across prior landmark U.S. studies, weight trajectory over time may also be relevant to the association between BMI and mortality. Our NHANES analyses using maximum lifetime BMI showed minimal change in parameter estimates. Lastly, there is a possibility of residual confounding and lack of exclusion of occult disease, as NHIS data was self-reported and likely underestimate true disease burden. However, we found that findings were sensitive to more restrictive definitions of &#8216;healthy&#8217; individuals using medication and laboratory data in the NHANES population, suggesting that the effect of underestimated disease burden is likely to be minimal.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that BMI in the overweight range is generally not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Our study suggests that BMI may not necessarily increase mortality independently of other risk factors in those with BMI of 25.0&#8211;29.9 and in older adults with BMI of 25.0&#8211;34.9. Consequently, this highlights the potential limitations of BMI in capturing true adiposity and limitations of its clinical value independent of traditional metabolic syndrome criteria. Longitudinal studies incorporating weight history, complementary measures of body composition and body fat distribution (e.g. waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio), undermeasured consequences of weight (e.g. psychological toll of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0287218.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]), and morbidity outcomes are needed to fully characterize the relationship between BMI and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec019" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0287218.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"

</p><p>Please see response to reviewer file. Pasted below:</p><p>Responses to Reviewer #1</p><p>1. The proposed novelty of the study is the use of a more contemporary sample of the U.S. population compared to what has been previously seen in the literature. Authors state that &#8220;nearly all U.S. studies to date used data from the 1960s through the 1990s and have included predominantly non-Hispanic White men and women.&#8221; I think that this is generally true.

It was much appreciated by our research team. We have now reframed the introduction to better address newer studies that have utilized data from the 2000-2010s, including the ones you shared. As you mentioned, some strengths of our study beyond the more recent study period include 1) subgroup analyses with sufficient power given our large sample size. NHANES data, while rich in clinical information, is far smaller than the NHIS data used in our primary analysis, and 2) comprehensive adjustment for bias and confirmation of findings in both NHIS and NHANES datasets.</p><p>Revision: </p><p>&#8220;Of the few studies using more contemporary populations15-87, they were restricted by small sample sizes limiting analysis in racial and gender subgroups, had inadequate adjustment for methodologic bias including reverse causality, collider bias, effect modification, and the healthy person effect, and/or only rudimentarily characterized the dose-response relationship between BMI and mortality.&#8221; (Introduction, Paragraph 2, Page 3)</p><p>2. Suggest changing subjects to particpants</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now changed the term &#8216;subjects&#8217; to &#8216;participants&#8217; throughout the manuscript text.</p><p>3. Introduction: See &#8220;overall&#8221; comments. The addition of the three suggested studies to your references highlights that, yes there are some contemporary population-based studies that attempt to answer this question but still have limitations that your study circumvents. A couple of sentences discussing theses studies and their limitations would strengthen your rationale.</p><p>Thank you again for the suggestion. As noted above, we have changed the introduction to reflect the three studies suggested as well as one other study we found upon literature review.</p><p>4. Were the STROBE guidelines followed for this study?</p><p>Yes, we made sure to use the STROBE guidelines checklist while preparing the manuscript.</p><p>5. Suggest providing the references that detail the linking methodology for the NDI to the NHIS.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

There are some studies that suggest the use of two years for mortality during follow-up exclusion may not be enough to control for residual confounding. Did you perform any sensitivity analysis with a larger follow-up time?</p><p>Thanks for this insightful comment. We did conduct several sensitivity analyses to account for reverse causality and residual confounding, including increasing the follow-up exclusion to 5 years as was done in the meta-analysis referenced. Exclusion of early deaths is a technique to try and account for subclinical/undiagnosed disease that may lead to weight loss and thus disproportionately contribute to lower BMI groups. However, we did not find any significant change in risk of mortality across any of the BMI categories. Several studies have noted similar findings &#8211; that increasing the exclusion follow-up time period may not significantly impact risks; however, it can lead to significant selection bias because a sizeable portion of the population can be excluded. We thus opted not to exclude 5 years of follow-up. To clarify this further, we explained this in more detail in the discussion and also included a supplementary table S10 that excludes the first 5 years of deaths.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>&#8220;To examine the potential impact of reverse causality due to subclinical disease, we conducted analyses limited to participants who did not die within the first two years of follow-up. Although some prior meta-analyses have excluded the first five years of follow-up, there has been concern that such exclusions would lead to significant selection bias as a sizeable proportion of the study population would be excluded, without significant benefit in reducing reverse causality. Nevertheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding the first five years of follow-up.&#8221; (Methods, Statistical Analysis, Paragraph 3, pg. 5)</p><p>See Supplementary Table S10.</p><p>7. I&#8217;m wondering if having the NHANES analysis as a secondary, sensitivity analysis diminishes its potential impact. Why not include it in your abstract and primary methods? Other studies have done this. The results from your NHANES analysis are quite impactful. It is possible that it is a space issue. Nonetheless, the NHANES analysis provides good results.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree with your assessment that the NHANES results are quite impactful and provide further insight complementary to NHIS findings. However, due to word count/table limitations, we could not include it in the primary analysis and is instead in the supplement. We felt the NHIS, given its large sample size, provided much more robust estimates and allowed for subgroup analyses so it was used as the primary analysis.</p><p>8. I understand the rationale for not adjusting for comorbidities in the main analysis but why not conduct subgroup analysis by disease status (e.g. CVD, cancer, diabetes, hypertension) similar to Calle et al.? It seems you might have done this in your results for diabetes and hypertension (See first comment under results heading) but there is nothing written about it. It might be prudent to see if the dose-response seen in the overall sample holds when you restrict analysis to those with disease.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We in fact did do subgroup analyses by disease status as determined by Calle et al., Berrington de Gonzalez et al., and our own more rigorous definition of disease. We acknowledge that this was likely not clear in the manuscript, so we have clarified this now in the revised manuscript. All figures in the main analysis have a subgroup of healthy, never-smokers who do not have CVD or cancer. In the supplementary file, Figure S2 shows the BMI-mortality associations by disease-free status. The red line depicts never-smoking individuals without minor morbidity, defined as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, non-skin cancer except melanoma, COPD, current asthma, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or functional limitations. The blue line depicts never-smoking participants without major morbidity, defined via Berrington de Gonzalez et al. as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and non-skin cancer except melanoma. We did not show individuals with disease because of the aforementioned biases of reverse causality and confounding by pre-existing disease. Although we do not show the data, we did conduct the analysis which showed the BMI-mortality curve shifts downwards, suggesting more inverse associations with mortality at overweight BMI ranges. However, this is more likely to be due to confounding than a true inverse association.</p><p>Revision:</p><p>&#8220;We further conducted analyses among subgroups of disease-free individuals, utilizing different definitions of disease: minor morbidity, defined as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, non-skin cancer except melanoma, COPD, current asthma, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or functional limitations; and major morbidity, defined via Berrington de Gonzalez et al.4 as self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and non-skin cancer except melanoma.&#8221; (Methods, Statistical Analysis, Paragraph 2, Pg. 4)</p><p>9. Results: Page six, third paragraph seems to be missing results. &#8220;Upon additionally controlling for comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension,&#8221; there are no results listed after this.</p><p>Thank you for catching this typo. We had initially intended on deleting the sentence completely. However, we have now updated the text to complete the sentence to illustrate the concept of collider bias. This was meant to be more of a sensitivity analysis as adjustment for obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension would likely lead to collider bias, leading to the appearance that mortality risks are lower than they really are.</p><p>Revision:</p><p>&#8220;Upon additionally controlling for comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension (potential colliders), risk of mortality marginally decreased among overweight BMI categories (BMI 20.0-22.4: 1.10 [1.03,1.19], BMI 22.5-24.9: 1.00 [Ref], BMI 25.0-27.4: 0.95 [0.89,1.00], BMI 27.5-29.9: 0.96 [0.90, 1.02]).&#8221; (Results, Paragraph 2, Page 6)</p><p>Responses to Reviewer #2</p><p>10.

Just mentioning them would be fine knowing that readers can seek out the supplement to learn about the details of specific categories.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We had included the list of covariates that we adjusted for in the Cox proportional hazards regression in the &#8216;Statistical Analysis&#8217; section but realized that they were not explicitly mentioned in the Covariate subsection. We have now moved the text from the Statistical Analysis section to the Covariates subsection and provided more detail.</p><p>&#8220;Cox models were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, insurance coverage, region of residence, and citizenship status.&#8221; (Methods, Statistical Analysis, Paragraph 1, pg. 4)</p><p>11. 88 Page 5: Statistical Procedures.

Perhaps this needs to be split into several sentences in order to clarify the points being made. For one, effect modification is not a methodological bias (though an inadequate sample size to investigate effect modification would be a limitation to prior work).</p><p>For the covariates paragraph (i.e., just prior to the &#8216;Statistical Analysis&#8217; section): I suggest rephrasing &#8216;non-skin cancer except melanoma&#8217; for clarity (here and throughout the manuscript, I believe this adjustment includes cancers at various sites but only melanoma for skin cancer). I also suggest including clarification of the &#8216;healthcare utilization factor&#8217; variable (in parenthesis, as is done for the other covariates). Please indicate the specific supplement section where the covariate categorization is provided (and throughout the manuscript, for all mentions of &#8216;provided in the supplement&#8217;, please state a specific supplement section).</p><p>In the Statistical Analysis section, &#8216;we did not adjust for comorbidities in the main analysis, as they could be on the causal pathway between BMI and mortality or potential colliders&#8217;: Without including a DAG and explanation of potential intermediate variables at play, it is difficult to follow the potential collider argument. BMI may be causally associated with a comorbidity, such as diabetes (i.e., an arrow from BMI leading to diabetes), and diabetes causally associated with mortality (i.e., an arrow from diabetes to mortality, the causal pathway argument). However, I find it hard to justify an arrow stemming from mortality to diabetes, indicating that mortality is &#8216;causing&#8217; diabetes, which would be the case if diabetes were hypothesized to be a collider here.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">28 May 2023</named-content>
</p><p>Responses to Reviewer and Editor Comments:</p><p>1. Please add mention that the STRBE guidelines checklist was followed in preparing this manuscript.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now included a sentence in the Methods section confirming we have used the STROBE guidelines checklist.</p><p>2. In the Introduction, statements pertaining to racial diversity and racial subgroups (e.g., &#8216;more racially diverse&#8217;) should also include &#8216;ethnicity&#8217; (e.g., &#8216;more racially and ethnically diverse&#8217;).</p><p>Thank you for pointing out this oversight. We have now included &#8216;ethnicity&#8217; in the mentioned sentence.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;In contrast, the contemporary U.S. population: (1) has a substantially different BMI distribution, with mean BMI having risen by more than 2 kg/m2 in both men and women since the 1970s, and increasing skewness towards obese-range BMIs; (2) has seen &gt;10 year increases in life expectancy both overall and among obese individuals; (3) is more racially and ethnically diverse&#8230;&#8221; (Introduction, Page 3)</p><p>3. There is a statement in the Introduction, &#8216;inadequate adjustment for methodological bias including reverse causality, collider bias, effect modification, and health person effect&#8217;. Perhaps this needs to be split into several sentences in order to clarify the points being made. For one, effect modification is not a methodological bias (though an inadequate sample size to investigate effect modification would be a limitation to prior work).</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now changed the wording of the sentence and provided more descriptions of each of the sources of bias.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;Of the few studies using more contemporary populations, they were either restricted by small sample sizes limiting analysis in racial and gender subgroups, and/or only rudimentarily characterized the dose-response relationship between BMI and mortality. Furthermore, studies inconsistently adjusted for methodologic bias including confounding by illness-related weight loss, collider bias (e.g. the concept that conditioning on obesity-related disease may distort associations between risk factors like BMI and diet and subsequently bias downstream associations), and the healthy person effect (e.g. selection bias that may be introduced when selecting participants of different BMI groups who may otherwise be healthy).&#8221; (Introduction, Page 3)</p><p>4. For the covariates paragraph (i.e., just prior to the &#8216;Statistical Analysis&#8217; section): I suggest rephrasing &#8216;non-skin cancer except melanoma&#8217; for clarity (here and throughout the manuscript, I believe this adjustment includes cancers at various sites but only melanoma for skin cancer). I also suggest including clarification of the &#8216;healthcare utilization factor&#8217; variable (in parenthesis, as is done for the other covariates). Please indicate the specific supplement section where the covariate categorization is provided (and throughout the manuscript, for all mentions of &#8216;provided in the supplement&#8217;, please state a specific supplement section).</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have clarified the phrasing of the cancer comorbidity covariate to read as &#8220;non-skin cancer or melanoma&#8221;. We have also included a description of the healthcare utilization factors included in our analysis, and specified the specific supplement section to be referenced.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;&#8230;comorbidities (self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, non-skin cancer or melanoma, COPD, current asthma, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or functional limitations), and healthcare utilization factors (doctor&#8217;s visit in the past 12 months, mental health visit in the past 12 months). Covariate categorizations are provided in the supplement (Extended Supplementary Methods)&#8221; (Methods, BMI, Mortality, and Covariates, Page 4)</p><p>5. In the Statistical Analysis section, &#8216;we did not adjust for comorbidities in the main analysis, as they could be on the causal pathway between BMI and mortality or potential colliders&#8217;: Without including a DAG and explanation of potential intermediate variables at play, it is difficult to follow the potential collider argument. BMI may be causally associated with a comorbidity, such as diabetes (i.e., an arrow from BMI leading to diabetes), and diabetes causally associated with mortality (i.e., an arrow from diabetes to mortality, the causal pathway argument). However, I find it hard to justify an arrow stemming from mortality to diabetes, indicating that mortality is &#8216;causing&#8217; diabetes, which would be the case if diabetes were hypothesized to be a collider here. I suggest clarifying with a DAG or removing all reference to collider bias.</p><p>Thank you for this thoughtful comment. We have now included a DAG in the Supplement (Supplementary Figure S1) to illustrate the ways in which intermediary conditions such as diabetes and hypertension may be colliders. Briefly, we can posit that BMI is causally associated with diabetes and diabetes is causally associated with mortality. If there is an unmeasured confounder, such as poor nutrition, that is associated with BMI, and is causally associated with diabetes and mortality, diabetes becomes a collider (BMI and poor nutrition &#8216;collide&#8217; on diabetes). Adjusting for diabetes but not for diet (as it is unmeasured) may create a spurious association between BMI and diet and affect the association between BMI and mortality through this pathway. Preston and Stokes explain this phenomenon in much greater detail and more eloquently in the following paper: Preston SH, Stokes A. Obesity paradox: conditioning on disease enhances biases in estimating the mortality risks of obesity. Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.). 2014 May;25(3):454.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;Consistent with prior studies, we did not adjust for comorbidities in the main analysis, as they could be on the causal pathway between BMI and mortality or potential colliders for BMI and unmeasured confounders3-5 (Supplementary Figure S1).&#8221;</p><p>Figure caption: The following figure is a crude representation of our proposed DAG for the association between BMI and all-cause mortality. We can assume BMI is causally associated with diabetes and diabetes is causally associated with mortality. If there is an unmeasured confounder, such as poor nutrition, that is associated with BMI, and is causally associated with diabetes and mortality, diabetes becomes a collider (BMI and poor nutrition &#8216;collide&#8217; on diabetes). Adjusting for diabetes but not for diet (as it is unmeasured) may create a spurious association between BMI and diet and affect the association between BMI and mortality through this pathway.

Also in the Statistical Analysis section: &#8216;To examine the potential impact of reverse causality due to subclinical disease&#8230;&#8217;, I suggest including mention/brief clarification of what is meant by the term &#8216;reverse causality&#8217;, as eloquently described by your reference, Banack et al. 2019:</p><p>&#8216;in the context of obesity-mortality research, the term reverse causality is often used to refer to a situation in which disease status affects both exposure and outcome, because disease often causes weight loss and disease increases mortality risk. Despite being called reverse causality, this is actually a concept that fits the standard definition of confounding in epidemiology&#8230;. This is why, in the context of obesity-mortality studies, the phrase reverse causality is often used interchangeably with the terms &#8220;confounding by preexisting disease&#8221; or &#8220;confounding by illness-related weight loss&#8221;</p><p>The readership of PLOS One includes epidemiologists, obesity-mortality researchers, and others, and without clarification, the language may be confusing to some.</p><p>Thank you for this clarification. We have now changed or supplemented all reference to &#8216;reverse causality&#8217; with &#8216;confounding by illness-related weight loss&#8217; which we feel is definitely more intuitive to understand and can be appreciated by all readers.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;To examine the potential impact of reverse causality (i.e. confounding by illness-related weight loss), we conducted analyses limited to participants who did not die within the first two years of follow-up.&#8221; (Methods, Statistical Analysis, Page 5)</p><p>Revision: &#8220;Furthermore, studies inconsistently adjusted for methodologic bias including confounding by illness-related weight loss, collider bias&#8230;&#8221; (Introduction, Page 3)</p><p>7. In the Results section, characteristics: &#8216;Between the first four-year cycle (1999-2002) and the last cycle (2015-2018), mean BMI rose from 26.7 to 28.0 kg/m2 and prevalence of BMI of &#8805;30 increased from 22% to 31% (p&lt;0.001 for trend; Supplementary Figure S1). Nearly 21% had BMI of 25.0-27.4, and 14% had BMI of 27.5-29.9.&#8217; Supplementary Table S1 displays Mortality Rates by Subgroups, and Supplementary Table S2 displays Mortality Rates by Survey Cycle Year. Neither of these tables presents prevalence estimates directly (though these can be calculated from the data included in Table 2) so I wonder if the Supplementary Figure S1 reference here was in error? Could you clarify whether, &#8216;Nearly 21% had BMI of 25.0-27.4, and 14% had BMI of 27.5-29.9&#8217; encompasses prevalence estimates for all years combined?</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Supplementary Figure S1 (now Supplementary Figure S2) Panel C shows the distribution of BMI from the first four-year cycle to the last. We realize that it is not possible to calculate the mean BMI or the percent increase in BMI&gt;=30 visually from that so we have now removed reference to Figure S1. The statement, &#8220;Nearly 21% had BMI of 25.0-27.4, and 14% had BMI of 27.5-29.9&#8217; encompasses prevalence estimates for all years combined&#8221; refers to the prevalence for all years combined and is from Table 1.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;Between the first four-year cycle (1999-2002) and the last cycle (2015-2018), mean BMI rose from 26.7 to 28.0 kg/m2 and prevalence of BMI of &#8805;30 increased from 22% to 31% (p&lt;0.001 for trend; see Supplementary Figure S2 for distribution of BMI). Nearly 21% had BMI of 25.0-27.4, and 14% had BMI of 27.5-29.9 (Table 1).&#8221; (Results, Sample Characteristics, Page 5)</p><p>In the Results section, Race/ethnicity: Supplementary Table S1 does not present five-year mortality rates and unadjusted risks by race/ethnicity, please add these data or indicate &#8216;data not show&#8217; (though I prefer adding the data). Did the difference between Hispanic adults with BMIs from 25.0 to 29.9 vs. other groups attain statistical significance? Was this examined with a cross product?</p><p>Thanks for pointing out this oversight. We had included some data in the supplementary text underneath Supplementary Table S1 that we have now included in the main text: &#8220;Among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic participants, 5-year mortality was highest in those with BMI &lt;18.5 (White: 40 [95% CI, 38-43] per 1,000 person-years, Black: 43 [37-50], Hispanic: 20 [16-25]). Five-year mortality was lowest at 11.7 (11.2-12.2) among those with BMI of 30.0-34.9 in White adults and 10.0 (8.8-11.3) at BMI of 35.0-39.9 in Black adults, and 7.1 [6.5-7.8] in Hispanic adults.&#8221;</p><p>The multiplicative interaction (cross-product) between race/ethnicity and BMI on all-cause mortality did not reach significance after adjustment for covariates. However, we felt it was still important to include racial/ethnic subgroups because of the well-studied racial/ethnic differences in various components of body composition and CV risk factors. We have now more explicitly stated that in the text.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;These patterns persisted, albeit insignificantly, after adjustment (Figure 4, P-interaction = 0.21).&#8221; (Results, Race/ethnicity, Page 6)</p><p>8. Discussion section: As you suggest, time period effects (e.g., differences in the racial ethnic make-up of the U.S. population over time) may explain the contrasting results, therefore mention of the time period under study for all prior work would be help to include (i.e., the meta-analysis by Flegal et al. covered what time frame/period?).</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now included the time periods for all the referenced studies in the discussion section.</p><p>9. Discussion section: &#8216;weight change over time can both confound associations with mortality&#8217; is confusing as written, please clarify.</p><p>Apologies for the confusing wording. We have now changed the wording slightly to have it read better.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;Further, BMI alone may be insufficient in classifying high-risk adiposity &#8211; both waist circumference31,32 and weight change over time can modify associations BMI-mortality associations, as seen in our NHANES findings&#8221; (Discussion, Page 8)</p><p>10. Discussion section: Second to last paragraph, &#8216;In summary, our study of a contemporary representative&#8230;.&#8217; includes recommendations and conclusions outside of the scope of the data presented here (e.g., &#8216;Clinicians patients may benefit from using complementary measures of adiposity&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;guidance on management of overweight and obesity&#8217;). I suggest removing this paragraph and including mention of the limitations of BMI as a measure in the previous paragraph (or elsewhere). The last paragraph does a lovely job of summarizing the main take away points from these data and analyses.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have adjusted the final two paragraphs of the discussion to exclude any out-of-scope implications and combined them into one paragraph.</p><p>Revision: &#8220;In conclusion, our findings suggest that BMI in the overweight range is generally not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Our study suggests that BMI may not necessarily increase mortality independently of other risk factors in those with BMI of 25.0-29.9 and in older adults with BMI of 25.0-34.9. Consequently, this highlights the potential limitations of BMI in capturing true adiposity and limitations of its clinical value independent of traditional metabolic syndrome criteria. Longitudinal studies incorporating weight history, complementary measures of body composition and body fat distribution (e.g. waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio), undermeasured consequences of weight (e.g. psychological toll of obesity), and morbidity outcomes are needed to fully characterize the relationship between BMI and mortality.&#8221; (Discussion, Page 8-9).</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0287218.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">BMI_mortality_PLOSOne_ResponsetoReviewer_5.28.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0287218.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0287218.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0287218.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Ehrlich</surname><given-names initials="SF">Samantha Frances</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Samantha Frances Ehrlich</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Samantha Frances Ehrlich</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0287218" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
