However, further work should also explore other sources of DVA, such as that recorded in secondary health care, family, and criminal justice records, to understand the true scale of the problem.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>data linkage</kwd><kwd>domestic violence</kwd><kwd>domestic abuse</kwd><kwd>health data</kwd><kwd>family justice data</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is known to have long-term and wide-ranging detrimental impacts on the health and well-being of children and families [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The UK Domestic Abuse Act 2021 [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] defines &#8220;abusive behaviour&#8221; as occurring between &#8220;personally connected&#8221; parties aged &#8805;16 years and includes &#8220;physical or sexual abuse; violent or threatening behaviour; controlling or coercive behaviour; economic abuse; and psychological, emotional, or other abuse.&#8221;</p><p>Annual DVA statistics are published for Wales and England by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), using information from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). The latest available DVA data from the CSEW highlighted that women are much more likely to be exposed to DVA than men, with an estimated 7.3% of women (1.6 million) and 3.6% of men (757,000) aged 16 to 74 years experiencing DVA in the year ending March 2020 [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Research studies report varying estimates of the prevalence of DVA toward women in the United Kingdom; in 1 systematic review, the lifetime prevalence of partner violence against women in the general UK population ranged from 13% to 31%, whereas the 1-year prevalence ranged from 4.2% to 6% [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The 1-year prevalence of DVA for women attending a general practitioner (GP) in the United Kingdom was estimated to be 17% in a cross-sectional survey study [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and 0.15% in a recent data linkage study that used Read (Read refers to originator Dr James Read) codes (hierarchical nomenclature used to record clinical information) to search for records of DVA within GP administrative data&#8217; [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another recent primary care data linkage study estimated that the prevalence of women in the United Kingdom aged &#8805;18 years recorded as having lifetime experience of DVA in 2017 was 0.37% [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Hard-to-reach populations are often excluded from DVA research and statistics [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; for example, the CSEW excludes those living in nonpermanent households and therefore risks excluding individuals considered vulnerable in women&#8217;s refuges as well as homeless populations [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One such group that is considered vulnerable and often hard to reach comprises individuals involved in public law family court proceedings. When a child is identified as having experienced, or is at risk of experiencing, significant harm at the hands of a parent or caregiver, the local authority may issue care or supervision proceedings under section 31 of the Children Act (1989; s.31). Since the advent of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, harm to children now includes being exposed to, or witnessing, DVA [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This change to the definition of significant harm reflected growing awareness of the negative impact of DVA on children and families. Nevertheless, this growing recognition has not been matched by sufficient analysis of DVA for families involved with the family courts.</p><p>There is an important evidence base on the heightened health vulnerabilities of parents and children involved in public family law proceedings, including high rates of mental health need and substance use [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, published research on DVA using large-scale data is more limited, despite DVA being classed as a major public health concern [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Drawing on the available research, 2 studies [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] conducted in England suggest that the prevalence of DVA in women involved in s.31 care proceedings is much higher than that in women in the general population. In a study of a sample of 386 s.31 applications made by 15 English local authorities, a little more than half of the mothers (51.1%) had their concerns about DVA recorded by children&#8217;s services [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, a case file analysis of a random sample of 354 mothers involved in recurrent care proceedings in England from 50 local authorities revealed that 65% of the mothers had been exposed to DVA by the time of the initial proceedings [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Local authorities have highlighted that DVA is one of the most important drivers of the increased demand for children&#8217;s social care services in recent years [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Annual statistics on children &#8220;in need&#8221; assessments in England have consistently demonstrated that DVA within the household is the most common concern identified at the end of assessments, and it remained the most common factor in 2020-2021 [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although comparable data from Wales are unavailable, a survey of adverse childhood experiences conducted in 2015 reported that 16% of the Welsh adult population were exposed to DVA during childhood [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Regarding studies using population-level data to understand DVA in the broader child welfare population, a small number of studies are notable. A recent data linkage study reported that children of mothers with experience of DVA in Manitoba, Canada, were significantly more likely to be receiving services from child welfare organizations than children of mothers who reported no prior experience of DVA [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another longitudinal ecological study found that increases in the rate of infant entry into care over time in England were associated with an increased prevalence of maternal history of adversity-related hospital admissions, including hospital admissions related to exposure to DVA [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A further study examined patterns of co-occurrence and severity of DVA, substance misuse, and depression in female caregivers involved with child protective services in the United States; one-third of the sample reported high rates of all factors, including both minor and severe DVA, whereas only 9% reported none [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Among women with experience of DVA, mothers whose children were taken into care had more children, were more likely to have self-reported addictions, and had significantly less education than mothers without child protective services involvement. In addition, those with exposure to DVA and with children in care reported significantly more physical abuse from their partners, more psychological distress, and lower quality of life than mothers whose children were not in care; however, there were no statistically significant associations with clinical depression or posttraumatic stress disorder [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Risk factors for DVA among women in the general population are listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) public health guidance on identifying, preventing, and reducing DVA [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and they include age (women aged between 16 and 24 years are at higher risk than older women), long-term illness or disability, poor mental health, being separated from a partner, pregnancy, postnatal depression, and substance misuse. Other risk factors reported in the literature include intentional and nonintentional injury hospitalizations [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], unemployment, and living in a low-income or single-parent household [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The availability of routinely collected population-level administrative data for research provides the opportunity to study cohorts of populations that are hard to reach or considered high risk [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This study analyzed administrative records held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for a cohort of mothers involved in public family law court proceedings and a matched group of mothers in the general population of Wales. The primary aim was to investigate risk factors associated with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA for women involved in public family law proceedings. In addition, we aimed to (1) estimate involvement in public family law proceedings as a risk factor for primary care&#8211;recorded DVA compared with a comparison group, (2) estimate the population and cohort prevalence of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA, and (3) evaluate whether routinely collected data could be used to create and identify additional risk factors associated with DVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Data Sources</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>This is a population-scale, individual-level cohort study that examines risk factors of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA for mothers in Wales.

For that study, the Cafcass Cymru data were used to select parents (both mothers and fathers) of children involved in s.31 care proceedings in Wales between 2011 and 2019, including only those parents with an ALF and valid demographic data.

We found that mothers involved in the public law family courts were at increased risk of DVA, being 8 times more likely to have primary care&#8211;recorded DVA than the general population group. Factors that were significantly associated with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA in the general population group included being aged &lt;25 years, having a record of a mental health or substance use condition, and having multiple house moves. Of these factors, only mental health remained significantly associated with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA within the cohort of mothers involved in the public law family courts. Additional variables, informed by the literature and derived from linked administrative data, were also significantly associated with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA within the cohort of family court mothers; these included living in a sparsely populated area, having an assault-related ED attendance, and having &gt;1 child. However, deprivation, so often associated with risk of poor health, was not found to have a significant association with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>Our reported 2-year prevalence of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA in the general population (626/233,171, 0.27%) is in line with a 1-year prevalence of 0.1% reported in a recent study [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For the family court cohort, the prevalence of 5.73% (269/4695) is comparable with a previous data linkage study reporting a 1-year prevalence of DVA of 5% in mothers whose children had entered public care [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Furthermore, our finding that these mothers are 8 times more likely to have a record of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA than the general population group is similar to that of previous research reporting AOR values of 8.8 for an association between <italic toggle="yes">child welfare involvement</italic> and DVA screened for at childbirth [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Finally, our findings are similar to recent evidence showing that 4% of the women involved in <italic toggle="yes">private</italic> family law cases in Wales had exposure to DVA noted in their GP records in the year before the proceedings [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies that have highlighted the co-occurrence of DVA with mental health and substance use problems in the general population [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Studies have also highlighted the high prevalence and co-occurrence of DVA, poor mental health, and substance use among parents whose children have been taken into care [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, in this study, only mental health remained significantly associated with DVA within the cohort of mothers involved with the family courts, once all other risk factors were adjusted for, and substance use was not significantly associated with DVA. Although the relationship between poor mental health and DVA is likely bidirectional, this finding emphasizes that mothers involved with the public law family courts who have experienced DVA are likely to have an additional need for mental health services and ongoing mental health support.</p><p>Maternal age is commonly reported as having negative associations with DVA, with younger age relating to increased risk [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, being aged &lt;25 years was associated with DVA in the general population group but not in the cohort of mothers involved in public law family court proceedings, which may be explained by the much higher proportion of mothers aged &lt;25 years in the cohort. Of the additional variables included in this study, perhaps the finding that DVA was associated with living in a sparsely populated area is the most interesting. Previous research links rurality with increased prevalence, severity, and duration of DVA. Possible reasons for this are that perpetrators may commit more chronic and severe DVA, mothers may have less access to social support networks in rural settings, there may be a lack of access to services such as hostels to potentially escape abusive behavior, and differential policing and health care may also have an impact [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The issue is complex, and there are evidently many plausible reasons to explain such an association. Additional data would be required to allow further investigation into these areas. Interestingly, deprivation, so often associated with risk of poor health, was not found to have a significant association with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA. Understanding this result would require further research but could indicate that using area-level measures of deprivation, which lack granularity, is not a suitable approach to examining the relationship between DVA and deprivation and that individual-level deprivation measures may be more robust for identifying risks associated with primary care&#8211;recorded DVA. Given underreporting of DVA within primary care settings, it may also be that those who actively engage with their GP and report DVA are not the most deprived.</p><p>At the time of writing, reliable ethnicity data were not available in the Cafcass Cymru data; therefore, this aspect was not explored in these analyses. Work is underway to improve the quality of ethnicity recording. However, recent research has highlighted the heterogeneity of the relationship between DVA and mental or physical health based on ethnicity [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], finding that non-Hispanic Black women and non-Hispanic White women who experienced DVA were more likely to experience poor mental health over time, whereas there was no association between DVA and mental health outcomes for Hispanic mothers. In addition, only Black mothers who experienced DVA were more likely to report more physical health problems over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><sec><title>Strengths</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first population-scale study using primary care records to identify DVA and examine risk factors for DVA among mothers in Wales. The study combined Cafcass Cymru data with health and demographic data to provide novel evidence on a group of mothers considered vulnerable and involved in family law court proceedings in Wales. Estimates of primary care&#8211;reported DVA prevalence are provided for a cohort of family court mothers as well as the matched cohort from the general population and validated against previous studies, which confirms underreporting of DVA in GP administrative data. Previously identified risk factors were recreated using linked administrative data based on previous research, thus facilitating national-scale analyses where research has previously been limited to smaller numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The study recreated NICE risk factors, which necessitated creation of proxy measures; for example, <italic toggle="yes">long-term illness</italic> was replaced in this study with <italic toggle="yes">intellectual disability</italic>, which prevents direct comparison with results reported for some risk factors. Such decisions were made based on pragmatism with regard to the availability of data and algorithms to recreate conditions. Future work could seek to develop a more robust version of the <italic toggle="yes">long-term illness</italic> measure as described by NICE.</p><p>As the study is cross-sectional, temporality cannot be determined; therefore, it is unclear whether the risk factors precede, and thus increase, the risk of DVA in GP records or vice versa. Longitudinal studies are recommended for future research, although such studies would also face underreporting issues, and it would be difficult to determine when DVA first occurred using GP administrative data. The 2-year prevalence of primary care&#8211;reported DVA of 5.73% (269/4695) reported in this study is likely a conservative figure. Estimating the prevalence of DVA is problematic owing to issues such as variation in screening and recording practices and definitions of DVA, as well as underreporting [<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>-<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Underreporting of DVA is widely acknowledged owing to the numerous sensitive and complex reasons that can prevent those experiencing DVA from disclosing it to the police or in health care settings, some of which include fear that they will not be believed; fear of retaliation and further violence; economic dependence; fear of social services involvement, child protection proceedings, or loss of child custody; fear of a negative response from the police or health care professional; and lack of options to escape victimization [<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>-<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The magnitude of underreporting is indicated by the CSEW, which estimated that only 18.4% of the women and 14.7% of the men who had experienced DVA between April 2017 and March 2018 reported it to the police [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Data linkage studies demonstrate substantial underrecording of DVA in GP data compared with CSEW data [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, documentation of DVA by GP&#8217;s is inconsistent across the United Kingdom [<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. One early UK study on DVA in primary care found that DVA was documented in the medical records of only 17% of the women with self-reported DVA [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Barriers to recording DVA in primary care include attitudes of clinicians and those with exposure to DVA to recording and reporting DVA [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]; for example, GP&#8217;s have expressed concerns around preserving confidentiality and the time needed to inquire about DVA, and they have demonstrated a lack of awareness of national and local guidance on documenting DVA [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], whereas in 1 study, 20% of the women objected to screening for DVA [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Implications for Research, Practice, and Policy</title><p>This research provides new evidence in terms of DVA prevalence and understanding of risk factors for a group of mothers traditionally hard to reach and considered vulnerable, some of whom may not be represented in official DVA statistics. The findings indicate that risk factors for DVA for mothers involved in public law family court proceedings differ from risk factors for DVA for the general population of women, as noted in the national NICE guidelines. With additional risk factors highlighted, there may be value in creating bespoke guidelines specifically relating to groups considered vulnerable, such as mothers involved in the family courts who were found to be much more likely to experience DVA than mothers in the general population.</p><p>The additional information may be useful in providing further information for those working with such individuals considered vulnerable in terms of policy setting or providing frontline assistance; for example, the increased risk of DVA for mothers living in sparsely populated areas could be used as evidence to improve support services in such areas. Increased risks associated with ED assault may be an obvious link but could be used to emphasize or provide additional services or signposting within EDs.</p><p>The findings corroborate underreporting of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA, an obvious limiting factor to this research. Purposefully improving such data collection would allow more robust analyses to corroborate or improve the evidence base to provide to stakeholders to allow more informed changes to be made to help those in need. Programs aimed at improved identification and reporting of DVA have been developed and run within GP practices [<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and research projects have reviewed and recommended improvements to DVA recording across health settings [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Programs such as these will improve the quality of data collection and subsequent use of the data for research.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides information on risk factors associated with DVA for a cohort of mothers involved in public family law proceedings who self-report to a GP compared with a general population comparison group and highlights the increased risk for this cohort of mothers considered vulnerable. Further evidence of the association between having a mental health condition and experiencing DVA should help to corroborate the necessity for continued and further resources targeted at specialist mental health and DVA support services. The additional evidence that this study adds in highlighting risk in sparsely populated areas should further inform service design.</p><p>An initial model including the general population of Wales shows common risk factors (NICE) can be reproduced with these data and analytical approach and highlights the increased association of primary care&#8211;recorded DVA for mothers involved with the family courts. Analysis of the same risk factors solely within the cohort of family court mothers emphasized key differences in associations with DVA. A final model that included additional risk factors helped to further explain some of the variability for the cohort, which adds more information and understanding of this population.</p><p>The results support the case for the use of administrative data to improve understanding of DVA risk factors, especially for groups considered vulnerable, to improve the evidence base and inform policy guidelines. Such groups that are hard to reach and considered vulnerable are more likely to be excluded from more traditionally gathered statistics, whereas, in this situation, their interaction with health services is recorded as standard; the inclusion of such individuals lessens implications of external validity and generalizability [<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>However, caution is urged in the interpretation of the results because the variability in individual situations and the complexity of lived experiences of DVA cannot be fully explained using the available data and modeling approaches used in this study. Improved reporting of DVA in GP administrative data would improve validity in future work. Nonetheless, accepting such limitations, the information provided is valuable and highlights risk factors that may be useful for policy makers and those services working with such mothers considered vulnerable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study uses anonymized data held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank, which is part of the national population data research infrastructure for Wales.
