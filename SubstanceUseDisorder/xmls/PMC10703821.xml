In the UK, lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Computerised Tomography (CT) for lung cancer screening has been shown to reduce the risk of lung cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; notably 20% reduction in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and 24% reduction in the Dutch&#8211;Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Lung cancer screening trials using CT scans have mainly used two risk factors, age and smoking history, in their inclusion criteria for the identification of high-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

High-risk participants are identified by a two-step process and those eligible on assessment are offered low-dose CT screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The first step involves identifying participants who have ever-smoked, those registered with a GP practice and those aged between 55 and 75 years, using the general practice EMR. The second step involves a comprehensive assessment, which includes a spirometry test and a discussion to assess participants&#8217; individual lung cancer risk. The Lung Health Check programme uses two of the existing lung cancer risk prediction models for step two: Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO)<sub>M2012</sub> and Liverpool Lung Project version 2 (LLPv2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

SAIL databank has data from primary care EMRs from Wales and covers ~70% of the population of Wales, representative of the wider population in terms of age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We identified all participants that were currently registered with a participating practice on January 1, 2011 and who had been registered for a full year prior to this date, as electronically coded data was most complete from this point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These data were regarded as the start of the follow-up period for SAIL analysis. The validation cohort was UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study which includes 502,640 participants enrolled from 22 different centres across England, Scotland, and Wales between 2006 and 2010 (5% response rate). At present, linked primary care data are only available for a subset of participants. The availability of primary care data depended on the electronic medical record system used by the practice (data only currently available from certain systems) rather than any participant-level factors. This subset is representative of the UK Biobank cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The date of recruitment for a participant to UK Biobank was regarded as the start of the follow-up period. The age range for SAIL was 55 to 75 years while in UK Biobank it was 55&#8211;73 years as that was the maximum age of participants recruited to UK Biobank. Participants with a previous history of lung cancer (based on lung cancer registry records) were excluded in both cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Predictor and outcome variables</title><p id="Par10">Age at baseline was used as a continuous variable in both datasets. Sex was used as a categorical variable. The Welsh Index for Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] in SAIL and Townsend score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in UK Biobank, respectively, were used to measure socioeconomic status and the scores were divided into quintiles. WIMD is the Welsh Government&#8217;s official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in Wales. It identifies areas with the highest concentrations of several different types of deprivation. WIMD ranks all small areas in Wales from most deprived to least deprived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Townsend Deprivation Index is a measure of material deprivation first introduced by Peter Townsend in 1987. A Townsend score can be calculated using a combination of four census variables for any geographical area (provided census data is available for that area): households without a car, overcrowded households, households not owner-occupied, persons unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A previous study has found association between Townsend score and lung cancer risk among symptomatic patients attending GP practices in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In both datasets, smoking status was defined using general practice Read codes and divided into three categories: non-smokers, previous smokers, and current smokers, using Read codes from previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (please see Supplementary File Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for read codes used). There was a considerable heterogeneity in the duration between recording of the smoking status and the start of the follow-up period across the two cohorts. Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> shows the median duration (with interquartile range) across different smoking categories in the two cohorts.</p><p id="Par11">We used a previously published list of 40 long-term conditions (LTCs), defined using Read codes in SAIL as predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (please see Supplementary File Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> for Read2 and CTV3 codes). In addition, we also considered previously identified risk factors for lung cancer by PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> and LLPv2 as candidate predictor variables. Painful conditions as a LTC included a broad group of conditions which included back pain, joint pain, headaches (not migraine), sciatica, plantar fasciitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, shingles, disc problem, prolapsed disc/slipped disc, spine arthritis/spondylitis, ankylosing spondylitis, back problem, osteoarthritis, gout, cervical spondylosis, trigeminal neuralgia, and disc degeneration, using previously validated definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In UK Biobank, participants also self-reported/underwent an examination for information on family history of lung cancer, detailed history on smoking status and body mass index, while in SAIL all candidate predictor variables were extracted from general practice records. The outcome of interest was lung cancer incidence at 6 years of follow-up, which was derived by searching for the presence and date of ICD-10 code &#8220;C34&#8221; within linked cancer registry records in both cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par13">All statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.0.3 in R studio.

Age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and presence/absence of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;40 LTCs were entered as predictor variables. In addition, we also considered previously identified risk factors for lung cancer by PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> and LLPv2 as candidate predictor variables. The association of selected variables (by backward selection) with 6-year lung cancer risk was examined using logistic regression models in both development (SAIL) and validation cohorts (UK Biobank). Interaction between selected variables and smoking status was tested and if a significant statistical interaction was found, this was added to the final risk score. The discriminating ability of the newly developed EMR-based lung cancer risk score in the prediction of lung cancer was compared to ever-smoked criteria from the TLHC programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in the SAIL and the UK Biobank cohorts using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under curve (AUC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The calibration performance of the new EMR-based lung cancer risk score was evaluated using cut-off values at each 10% increment and compared against the ever-smoked criteria. This was done in both development and validation cohorts. The number of false positive, true positive, true negative and false negative cases were reported for each threshold. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and balanced accuracy (formula= sensitivity + specificity/2) were also reported for each threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The number of ever-smokers excluded, the number needed to detect one lung cancer and the number correctly excluded for every lung cancer missed were also reported for each 10% increments in both cohorts. The number needed to screen to detect one lung cancer was calculated using the formula: (false positive + true positive)/true positive cases. The number correctly excluded for every lung cancer case missed using the formula: (true negative+ false negative)/false negative.

In both datasets, the ALIGNED score had high positive predictive values but low negative predictive values. The number of patients needed to be screened to detect one patient with lung cancer was comparatively smaller for SAIL across all the decile cut-off scores, which is expected as SAIL is the more

The new score outperformed the ever-smoking status from TLHC in discrimination and calibration, however underperformed against the questionnaire-derived PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> and LLPv2 risk scores. The new ALIGNED score may have a potential role in implementation of lung cancer screening at population level, crucially without requiring patient contact, while the other commonly used scores like PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> and LLPv2 rely on information which require participant response.</p><p id="Par25">A proactive approach based on individual risk prediction is being described as the future of early cancer detection, across all cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A risk prediction model-based approach in lung cancer screening has been found to be associated with greater reduction in lung cancer mortality in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

A personalised lung cancer risk score generated from the EMR could potentially help with reducing perceived cancer risk&#8212;a recognised barrier in lung cancer screening participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]&#8212;and enable those at higher risk to be provided with a personalised risk estimation. Identifying high-risk individuals at an early stage via EMR can pave the way for more personalised targeting of high-risk individuals for the next stage of risk assessment (including comprehensive smoking and family history, spirometry, +/&#8722; biomarkers/imaging) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Importantly, EMR-based lung cancer risk score can be calculated without any patient contact which means that everyone can be assessed, not just those who attend for a complete assessment, which has the potential to reduce health inequalities.</p><p id="Par26">We compared cumulative lung cancer incidence and AUC values in our cohorts with those from previous studies. The observed 6-year lung cancer cumulative incidence among ever-smokers was 5257 (2%) in SAIL (age 55&#8211;75 years) and 375 (0.8%) in UK Biobank (age 55&#8211;73 years), respectively. In comparison, cumulative lung cancer incidence was 0.85% (46/4380) at 5.5 years in the NELSON trial cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], 0.80% (599/75,958) at 5 years in UKLS trial cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], 1.84% (1463/79,209) in PLCO trial cohort and 3.73% (1925/51,527) in NLST trial cohort respectively at 6 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, the new EMR-based lung cancer risk score had an AUC value of 80% (SAIL) and 74% (UK Biobank). Previous studies have reported AUC values of 67%, 73%, 73%, 74 and 81% for LLP V2 risk score in different cohorts, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The ALIGNED score includes LTCs which have not been previously included in any previous lung cancer risk scoring system, however, previous research has found similar associations. A higher risk of lung cancer has been observed with heavy alcohol consumption: in particular, beer drinking was associated with higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 16,849 patients found a higher prevalence of lung cancer among those with peripheral vascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A cohort study in Germany involving 18,668 found a higher risk of intrathoracic cancers among stroke survivors, in both men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Using a large primary care representative cohort for development (SAIL) and another large community cohort (UK Biobank) for validation is one of the key strengths of this study. However, we acknowledge some limitations, particularly relating to the UK Biobank cohort. UK Biobank participants have been found to be less socioeconomically deprived, have fewer lifestyle risk factors and lower prevalence of LTCs than the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, despite lower absolute risk of lung cancer and other diseases, hazard ratios derived from UK Biobank should still be applicable to the wider UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. There was significant heterogeneity in the duration between recording of smoking status in GP EMR and the start of the study follow-up across different smoking categories in the two cohorts which would have likely influenced the accuracy of smoking status considered in both cohorts. In this study, we could not use free text data available in GP EMR for extracting more detailed information on predictor variables, including smoking behaviour as free text data was not available for research purposes in both these cohorts. Use of free text data and natural language processing methods have the potential to improve the prediction power and accuracy of lung cancer risk. The correlation between GP EMR-based classification and self-reported classification of smoking status had moderate correlation so there is a possibility of misclassification and measurement error when using GP records for capturing smoking status.</p><p id="Par28">A GP EMR-based lung cancer risk score-LUCGPEHR was validated using two large UK community cohorts and comprised of demographic information (age and socioeconomic status), smoking status, body mass index, family history of lung cancer, and presence/absence of ten LTCs. The crucial benefit of the ALIGNED score is not requiring patient contact for score calculation. The ALIGNED score outperformed the ever-smoked criteria used in the TLHC programme. The ALIGNED score may have a potential role as a &#8220;first step&#8221; in the implementation of lung cancer screening by facilitating more informed decision-making with personalised information available for participants. It can also be potentially used for improving screening precision by more focused targeting of high-risk individuals for lung cancer screening, however further research is urgently needed in this area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
