Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by impaired ability of producing or responding to insulin and has been reported to act as a risk factor of the progression of rotator cuff tendinopathy and tear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the development of various diseases, but little is known about their potential roles involved in RCT of diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used in this study to profile differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in RCT samples between 3 diabetic and 3 nondiabetic patients. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed to annotate the function of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network were constructed to elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms of DM affecting RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In total, 505 lncRNAs and 388 mRNAs were detected to be differentially expressed in RCT samples between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. GO functional analysis indicated that related lncRNAs and mRNAs were involved in metabolic process, immune system process and others. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that related mRNAs were involved in ferroptosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway and others. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed, and ceRNA network showed the interaction of differentially expressed RNAs, comprising 5 lncRNAs, 2 mRNAs, and 142 miRNAs. TF regulation analysis revealed that STAT affected the progression of RCT by regulating the apoptosis pathway in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We preliminarily dissected the differential expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in torn rotator cuff tendon between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. And the bioinformatic analysis suggested some important RNAs and signaling pathways regarding inflammation and apoptosis were involved in diabetic RCT. Our findings offer a new perspective on the association between DM and progression of RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12891-023-07149-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rotator cuff tear</kwd><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Long non-coding RNA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Beijing Tongzhou Talent Development Support Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>YHLD2017009</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Xicheng District Science and Technology Special Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>XCSTS-SD2022-08</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82002285</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Beijing Hospitals Authority Youth Programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>QML20230119</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Beijing Tongzhou Health Development Special Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>KJ2023CX008</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7222035</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Rotator cuff tears (RCT), usually caused by trauma and degeneration of the tendon tissue, is the leading cause of pain and functional disability of the shoulder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of RCT reaches to at least 10% among people over 60 years, which will leave a serious clinical problem in modern society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There was a suggestion that surgical rotator cuff repair (RCR) had long-term improvement in shoulder functions for RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but not all patients&#8217; outcomes of RCR are satisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and re-rupture of rotator cuff after operation is not infrequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which requires deep investigation of potential factors that may contribute to RCT. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disease with an estimated prevalence of 9.3% worldwide in 2019, rising to 10.2% by 2030 and 10.9% by 2045 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. DM has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with increased risk of rotator cuff tendinopathy and RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Noticeably, biological research has introduced the possible role of glucose as a risk factor for RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and recent evidence showed that the risk of rotator cuff diseases in the diabetic population is 2.11 times more than the non-diabetic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, patients with DM were 48% more likely to undergo RCR surgery compared to those without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and DM also impede rotator cuff healing with inferior outcome after rotator cuff repair. Notably, diabetic patients can achieve higher rate of healing after RCR with effective glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, it is critical important to understand the influence of DM on rotator cuff disease, which may provide deeper insight into the mechanism of RCT and its healing process.</p><p id="Par6">It has been reported more than 3000 genes were differentially expressed between torn and RC tendon tissue by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. RNA-seq analysis is a powerful tool to analyze the expression levels of all transcriptomes generated in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After total mRNA is sequenced and quantified, RNA-seq can describe the molecular mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200&#160;bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and have been reported to involved in biological process of tendon. For instance, Lu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] discovered that constant overexpression of lncRNA H19 promoted tenogenic differentiation in human tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs), and also enhanced tendon repair in a mouse model. In addition, Ge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] profiled lncRNAs involved in rotator cuff tendinopathy in comparison with the normal tendon through RNA-Seq, and the results showed that 419 lncRNAs were statistically differentially expressed between 2 groups, which underlined the huge potential of lncRNAs in regulating the process of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p id="Par7">The purpose of this study is to profile the differently expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in torn rotator cuff tendon between diabetic and nondiabetic patients and elucidate the potential roles of DM affecting RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient enrollment, selection and clinical data</title><p id="Par8">All the experiments and patients enrollment protocol were approved by Ethics Committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">Rotator cuff, consisted of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis muscles, is recognized as pivotal role in providing dynamic stabilization of the glenohumeral joint as well as contributing to shoulder movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. And RCT, especially degenerative tears are far more frequent and multifactorial in etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A series of factors have been evaluated to be risk for progression of RCT, including smoking, location and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Correspondingly, it has been reported that RCT is most prevalent in the middle-aged and older adults and becomes the primary reason for shoulder surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recently, there is a growing awareness that rotator cuff tendinopathy is highly prevalent in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the absence of DM was found to be associated with better successful recovery after arthroscopic repair of RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Bedi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed that diabetic rats had significantly less fibrocartilage after repair of RCT in contrast with nondiabetic animals. Besides, less organized collagen at the tendon-bone interface, as well as greater advanced glycosylation end products, was obviously observed in the diabetic group, which demonstrated sustained hyperglycemia impaired tendon-bone healing postoperatively. Similarly, Chung believed that inferior outcome of rotator cuff healing in patients with DM might be explained by impaired collagen production and collagen matrix formation, accumulation of advanced glycation end products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Besides, the hyperglycemic condition potentially promoted poor healing of rotator cuff because of inadequate production of several important cytokines or growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As for the gene expression profiling of patients with RCT, Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] identified the differentially expressed lncRNAs in inflammatory long head of biceps tendon (LHBT), which may cause chronic RCT. Based on their results, they found that lncRNA&#8209;COL6A4P2, A2MP1 and LOC100996671 may act as a regulator in the process of the inflammation of LHBT in RCT patients through NFKB2/NF&#8209;kappa B signaling pathway. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] comprehensively dissected the dysregulated transcriptome of RCT, including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. They constructed the lncRNA/circRNA-associated dysregulated ceRNA networks and identified several important ncRNAs among it (hsa_circ_0000722, hsa-miR-129-5p and hsa-miR-30c-5p). However, there haven&#8217;t been such a study to explore the role of DM in RCT by using RNA-Seq.&#160;To our knowledge, this is the first study to present a systematic dissection of the differential expression profile of mRNAs and lncRNAs in RCT between diabetic and non-patients and revealed some important functional enrichment pathways which may contribute to the development of diabetic RCT.</p><p id="Par36">In the current study, we successfully obtained the transcripts that were dysregulated in diabetic patients with RCT through identifying differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, compared with nondiabetic patients. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated that several pathways were potentially associated with DM in RCT. GO analysis was applied to annotate the biological processes of DEGs, the results showed that they were related to metabolic process and immune system process. It is unsurprising that enrichment analysis of these dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs was associated with metabolic process in diabetic patients. Correspondingly, PI3K/AKT pathway has been reported to be identified as therapeutic targets of obesity and T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Collagen is the main components in the native tendon matrix. Our results demonstrated that the mRNA expression of collagen V and collagen X were downregulated in the diabetic RC tendon tissue. Collagen V is expressed in native tendon tissue and plays a critical regulatory role in maintaining normal tendon structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It was reported that collagen V knockdown impacted collagen fibril size and shape during tendon healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, the expression of collagen X is found in the fibrocartilage of tendon-to-bone interface and persists through maturity and plays a role in the tissue mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Taken together, the down regulation of collagen V and collagen X in the diabetic RC tendon supports the in vivo histological results of significantly less fibrocartilage and organized collagen at the tendon-bone interface within the healing enthesis of diabetic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Early growth response 1 and 2 (Egr1/2) are important transcription factors act as molecular sensors for guiding the final steps of tendon maturation and production of collagens and proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has been proved that Egr1 and2 play a critical role in directing tenogenic differentiation and promoting tendon repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Tao ta al. reported that Egr-1 induced tenogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells and enhanced rotator cuff repair after injury in a rabbit model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the current study, both Egr1 and Egr2 were down-regulated in the diabetic RCT samples. This finding is consistent with the results reported by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In their study, results indicated that high glucose alters tendon homeostasis through downregulation of the AMPK/Egr1 pathway.</p><p id="Par39">The role of immune inflammatory response in RCT should also be paid attention. Based on Chung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] study, increased glucose level could lead to induce inflammatory cytokines in torn rotator cuff tendon tissue of diabetic patients, especially MMP9 and IL-6. However, Lewandowsk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]reported that the concentrations of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were lower in subjects with type 2 DM than in non-diabetic controls. In the current study, MMP-2 and MMP-11 were found to be down-regulated in the diabetic RC tendon. Based on the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network analysis, MMP11, which highly correlated with LINC01561-201, has been reported to strikingly protect against T2DM, while MMP11 deficient mice presented hallmarks of metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It was relevant to our data since MMP11 was apparently downregulated in diabetic patients. Viewed from above, regulation of MMPs appears to be complex in diabetic conditions, further deeper researches need to be carried out to decipher the role of MMPs in the pathological process of diabetic rotator cuff tear. In addition, our results indicated an up-regulation of IL-16, which is a pro-inflammatory pleiotropic cytokine in the diabetic group. Refer to literature, IL-16 gene polymorphism was correlated with type 2 DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were highly enriched IL-17 signaling pathway. In fact, IL-17&#160;A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and has been shown to be upregulated in early human tendinopathy. Mimpen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] demonstrated that IL-17&#160;A and its receptors were present in torn supraspinatus tendon tissue. Besides, they treated tendon-derived fibroblasts with IL-17 cytokines and confirmed that they induced a direct response and activated diverse pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, which indicated the IL-17 acted as amplifiers of tendon inflammation and should be target as potential therapeutic role in tendinopathy. Millar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] found that the expression of IL-17&#160;A was increased in early tendinopathy. Tenocytes treated with IL-17&#160;A presented a series of changes including increased type III collagen. It has been reported that the proportion of type III collagen would be increased in RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and the increasing expression ratio of type-III to type-I collagen can affect the biomechanical properties of rotator cuff tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. These findings indicate that IL-17 signaling pathway may be a feature in diabetic RCT and can be conducive to the occurrence of RCT. Furthermore, the role of ferroptosis, which was enriched in this study, in tendon injury has been investigated, since Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] used its inducer RSL3 to inhibit the tenogenesis in vitro and in vivo. As for Wnt signaling pathway, Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] found that enhanced expression of Wnt5a in aged TSPCs caused canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling shift, and they demonstrated that Wnt5a regulated TSPCs senescence via JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which was also involved in KEGG analysis. Conversely, genetic knockdown of JAK2 or STAT3 strongly alleviated TSPCs senescence of aged TSPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, we screened these, enriched pathways that were involved in complicated process related to tendon disorders or inferior properties of tendon. Taken together, these bioinformatically predicted signal pathways interfered by these lncRNAs could serve as a reference for future studies of diabetic RCT and should be validated in further experiments.</p><p id="Par41">TSPOAP1 was strongly linked with HAGLR-207 and was also the most-linked mRNA in ceRNA network. In fact, it mediates the inflammatory feedback through TNFR1 and downstream NF-&#954;B, a transcription factor that promotes inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and has been reported to involve in tendinopathic and ruptured Achilles tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, it plays a central role in inflammation by modulating the response of NLRP3 inflammasome, which is induced by TLR ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide via NF-&#954;B signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Since it was upregulated in diabetic RCT patients, investigating the role of TSPOAP1 mediated inflammation could provide new directions for in-depth studies of DM affecting RCT.</p><p id="Par42">Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has reported that several miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-129-5p and hsa-miR-30c-5p which were dysregulated in inflammation-related diseases, may involve in inflammatory response in RCT. In our study, hsa-miR-5787 was one of the miRNAs identified in ceRNA network. And it was reported to involve in the process of glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Meanwhile, it can attenuate LPS/TLR4-mediated inflammatory response via NF-&#954;B in ischemic cerebral infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We also found that one of its target mRNAs, HS3ST1, was reported to regulate Glucose-induced insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and HS3ST1-/- mice presented a strong proinflammatory phenotype that was unresponsive to anti-inflammatory activity of plasma antithrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which indicated that hsa-miR-5787 play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses in diabetic RCT patients.</p><p id="Par43">We also predicted cis- and trans- targets of Top 5 differentially expressed lncRNAs and found that the function of lncRNAs was complicated, since one lncRNA (such as MSTRG.204593.24) can target many mRNAs, and some mRNAs (such as KLHL29) can be regulated by various lncRNAs. In fact, different regions of human rotator cuff tendon specimens have variable balance between apoptotic and inflammatory processes, which is controlled by pro-and anti-apoptotic mechanisms and signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. As for TFs, we found that the STAT protein family members may play important roles in RCT development, trans-regulated by differentially expressed lncRNA in diabetic patients. Importantly, STAT proteins can mediate apoptosis through a variety of pathways, mainly due to transcriptional activation of genes that mediate or trigger the cell death process (such as Bcl-xL, caspases, Fas and TRAIL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Significantly, high glucose has been demonstrated to induce cell apoptosis and suppress the tendon-related markers expression of tendon-derived stem cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. And the high level of apoptosis in diabetic patients might impede tendon repair after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Furthermore, the impact of apoptosis in rotator cuff disease has also been investigated. Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] found that the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, which are mainly fibroblast-like cells, in the torn edges of rotator cuff tendons is twice more than that of normal tendons. Interestingly, the formation of advanced glycation end products, caused by DM, may promote cellular apoptosis in tendons via the expression of pro-apoptotic cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In conclusion, differentially expressed lncRNAs trans-regulate STAT in diabetic patients, thereby mediating apoptosis pathway and affecting the progression of RCT. Crucially, each member of STAT protein family has a unique role in apoptosis, since STAT1 activation is pro-apoptotic, but conversely, STAT 5 promotes cell survival, whereas STAT3 activation can have positively or negatively regulates cell survival, which depends on the stimulus and cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Hence, the specific role of STAT proteins in regulating the apoptosis pathway and thus affecting the progression of RCT needs further investigation.</p><p id="Par44">Albeit we first systematically profile the differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA in RCT between diabetic and nondiabetic patients and identified some signaling pathways as well as the potential mechanism, this study still has several limitations. First, this study is based on a relatively small sample size of three pairs of torn supraspinatus tendon samples from patients with/without DM, which may have limited generalizability and cause the possibility of presenting false negative results in some genes. Addition to this, the precise mechanism of how DM affecting RCT is not deciphered. Future trials with larger sample size and in-depth molecular experiments are needed to be carried out to reveal the precise molecular association between DM and RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">In summary, we first constructed and analyzed the differential expression patterns of lncRNAs and mRNAs in diabetic and nondiabetic RCT patients.
