Over the last decade, alcohol admissions to non-specialist hospitals in England have continued to rise (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">PHE 2023</xref>), current estimates suggest that 1 in 10 adults admitted are experiencing alcohol dependence (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#160;al. 2019</xref>).</p><p>Internationally, the clinical and financial impacts of alcohol disorders on non-specialist settings have led to the development of hospital-based alcohol services to improve the identification, treatment and through care of patients with the aim of enhancing outcomes and reducing the demand on hospital services (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">NHS England 2019</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Medicare Learning Network 2024</xref>). Those admitted with alcohol withdrawal (AW) (ICD-10 code F10.3) often experience suboptimal care within non-specialist services. AW is triggered by the sudden cessation or reduction of alcohol use in those with physical dependence, and if not adequately treated may progress to severe complications (i.e. seizures or delirium tremens) or even death. Abstinence from alcohol is the predominant treatment goal following the management of AW requiring the support of specialist treatment interventions and a network of support. Previous studies have identified those admitted to non-specialist services with AW commonly have a <italic toggle="yes">cluster of clinical complexity</italic> (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et&#160;al. 2019</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Blackwood et&#160;al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#160;al. 2021</xref>), receive negative treatment experiences (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Simon et&#160;al. 2020</xref>), and a lack of follow-up care (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Neighbors et&#160;al. 2005</xref>). These factors appear to contribute to a lack of engagement in community interventions following discharge and subsequent repeated hospital admissions; however, few studies in the UK have specifically examined the direct relationship between AW and readmission rates in non-specialist hospitals. No similar study has been previously conducted using a national representative dataset in England. Understanding the characteristics and predictors of 30-day readmission following an AW admission is essential to ensure hospital-based alcohol care teams develop appropriate clinical strategies that target those most likely to be readmitted. This study therefore aims to explore the characteristics and predictors of AW readmissions using Hospital Episode Statistics&#8212;Admitted Patient Care (HES-APC) records, which are routinely collected by the NHS in England.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective analysis using 2017&#8211;18 HES-APC records for England, which provides a national representative sample of clinical activity in non-specialist hospitals. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull (Ref: FHS180). An extract including all adult (18&#160;years or more) admissions from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 was purchased from the data custodians NHS Digital for the purpose of the study (DARS-NIC-226185-B6C2J) and included over 9.3 million Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) experienced by 5.3 million adults. These data included demographic information, activity data, and diagnostic codes using ICD-10 (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">WHO 1992</xref>). A FCE is the period admitted under the care of a single consultant. Each hospital stay contains one or more FCE to create a hospital spell of care (i.e. admission). A unique HES-ID allows the number of admissions to be assigned to an individual, calculation of the length of stay (LOS) for each admission and where appropriate the time in days between admissions. Each FCE provides up to 20 ICD-10 diagnostic codes, which were searched using the <italic toggle="yes">regexm</italic> command in STATA 15SE (Stata Corp.) to identify cases admitted including AW, additional ICD-10 diagnoses to calculate the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">NHS Digital 2019</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Charlson et&#160;al. 2022</xref>).</p><sec id="sec5"><title>Selection of cases</title><p>A conservative approach was adopted where cases were selected based on the presence of the ICD-10 F10.3 code as a primary or secondary diagnosis in any FCE of an admission in the first eleven months of the year. A 30-day readmission (i.e. &#8804;30&#160;days) for any reason was calculated for an individual to identify whether a hospital admission resulted in a subsequent readmission &#8804;30&#160;days from date of discharge. We excluded from analysis admissions related to a patient who died in hospital, or where the consultant episode remained open after the 1 March 2018.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Characteristics and predictors of AW readmission</title><p>Demographic variables including age, sex, and ethnicity were considered for inclusion. Whilst age and sex were fully coded, ethnicity codes were poorly completed. Missing at random analysis was conducted on the completeness of ethnicity codes, which identified that these cases were missing not at random (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001). Multiple imputation was subsequently attempted to reduce the number of missing cases in the model and compared with removing ethnicity from the model altogether. We determined that there was little difference in imputing ethnicity data and removing it when considering predictors of readmission. Therefore, the results of this paper focus on the model with ethnicity data removed.</p><p>Indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) scores were available in the dataset; however, this was not included in the model as those who were coded as having no fixed abode (NFA) did not have an IMD value recorded due to a lack of a postcode. NFA was therefore used as a dichotomous variable to indicate deprivation in the population and within the model.</p><p>Other variables in the dataset considered for inclusion in the model were emergency versus planned admission (including planned, booked, or elective), day of admission, and discharge and LOS. LOS was considered as a continuous variable calculated from admission and discharge dates with those admitted for &lt;24&#160;hours coded as LOS 1&#160;day. LOS of 11&#160;days or more was recoded as 11+ to avoid the influence of additional days unrelated to AW management as guidelines suggest initial medical treatment for AW rarely exceeds 10&#160;days (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">NICE 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analysis was conducted for all AW admissions in the dataset, with comparisons between those where a readmission in 30&#160;days occurred, and those where there was no subsequent readmission in 30&#160;days.</p><p>Once the dataset had been prepared, and cases selected, associations between characteristics were examined to determine the relationship between factors and those readmitted within 30&#160;days, and those which were not. This exploration incorporated demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, living circumstances), features of admissions (admission method, day of the week of admission), comorbidity (number of ICD-10 diagnoses on admission, ICD-10 diagnosis codes by chapter and CCI score), LOS (total days admitted), and features of discharge (day of the week of discharge, discharge against medical advice [DAMA]).</p><p>Two-way tables and Chi-squared tests were used to examine differences between groups for dichotomous variables, with non-parametric tests employed to examine differences between means for continuous variables. Where necessary categorical variables were transformed into dichotomous variables to allow for exploration of differences and associations using Chi-squared tests. Where the association between the variable and readmission in 30&#160;days had a statistical significance level of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;&#8804;.15, the variable was included in the logistic regression model to explore predictors of readmission.</p><p>Logistic regression was used to generate crude odds ratios for individual variables, and adjusted odds ratios within the logistic regression model. The HES data extract included AW admissions from 195 hospital providers. We controlled for hospital provider by incorporating the provider variable into our regression model, to reduce the potential impact of medical coding bias from each provider.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">vif</italic> command in STATA 15 SE was used to explore multi-collinearity within the model, where a value of 1 indicates no correlation between a given variable and any other variables in the model, a value of 1&#8211;5 indicates a moderate correlation, and a value &gt;5 indicates a potentially severe correlation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Results</title><p>The HES-APC dataset contained 21&#160;493 individuals who had a combined total of 27&#160;444 AW admissions within 2017&#8211;18.

Our results identify 20% of those identified as experiencing AW are readmitted within 30&#160;days of discharge from hospital, with the three main predictors of readmission being individuals of NFA, self-discharge, or DAMA from hospital and those experiencing greater clinical comorbidity as measured by CCI scores. Previous analysis of hospital admissions in England from 2004 to 2010 reports that the readmission rate for the wider hospital population (experiencing all diagnoses) is 7% (<xref rid="ref2a" ref-type="bibr">Blunt et&#160;al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>The largest previous study examining the impact of AW readmissions within non-specialist hospitals was conducted in the USA and identified similar outcomes. <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Yedlapati and Stewart (2018)</xref> conducted a cross-sectional retrospective evaluation of AW readmission rates and predictors of 30-day AW readmissions using a 2013 national representative sample in acute care and identified <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;393&#160;118 AW discharges. The authors identified a 30-day readmission rate of 19.7% (95%CI 19.0&#8211;20.4) and found DAMA and comorbid psychotic disorder as the strongest predictors of 30-day readmissions. Similar findings were identified in a study examining 30-day readmissions using the 2014 US Readmissions Database for all alcohol-related disorders (ARDs), which identified a readmission rate of 18.9% with those with ARD and comorbid conditions at greater risk of early readmission (<xref rid="ref21a" ref-type="bibr">Wani et&#160;al. 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis identified the strongest predictor of 30-day readmission to be NFA which is a key determinant of health linked to increasing healthcare use due to complex and untreated clinical comorbidities including mental health, substance use disorders, and excessive alcohol use (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Fountain et&#160;al. 2003</xref>). Arguably, admissions of those with NFA are potentially preventable if housing issues are addressed; however, individuals legitimately admitted due to clinical concerns involving AW are likely to lack the support required to establish abstinence on discharge. Given the short length of admission (mean of 4.6&#160;days) appropriate accommodation is unlikely to be secured placing the individual at a high risk of returning to dependent drinking that exacerbates preexisting conditions resulting in early readmission.</p><p>DAMA has previously been linked to increased mortality (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Southern et&#160;al. 2012</xref>) and higher 30-day readmission rates than planned discharges (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Spooner et&#160;al. 2020</xref>). Our previous analysis (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et&#160;al. 2023</xref>) examined DAMA against those experiencing planned discharges for those treated for AW and identified emergency admissions, shorter LOS (2.7 vs. 4.7&#160;days, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.001) and weekend discharges as characteristics significantly associated with DAMA.</p><p>All individuals experienced a complex cluster of clinical conditions with an average of eight diagnosed conditions, with digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and endocrine disorders among the most recorded comorbid conditions. Whilst we have observed greater comorbidity is predictive of 30-day readmission, we are unable to ascertain if these readmissions are preventable if effective alcohol treatment is provided on discharge or anticipated due the unpredictable nature and severity of these comorbid conditions. Previous analysis of routine hospital data in England (<xref rid="ref2a" ref-type="bibr">Blunt et&#160;al. 2014</xref>), which examined all 30-day readmissions, estimated that only 30% are potentially preventable as the majority experienced legitimate deteriorating medical presentations and were identified as unavoidable or &#8216;anticipated&#8217; 30-day readmissions.</p><p>Although policy intentions focus on the need to reduce alcohol-related admissions as a measure of effectiveness of services, it remains to be established to what extent AW readmissions can be preventable due to the high levels of comorbidity experienced by those admitted. Our analysis points toward the care of AW and transition initial recovery from alcohol dependence is likely to be suboptimal given the median LOS of 3 days means that many individuals may experience discharge at the peak of AW with limited time to facilitate meaningful transitions to specialist community services, outpatient services, or housing where needed.</p><sec id="sec11"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The use of routine administrative data provides a comprehensive national understanding as to how AW readmissions impact non-specialist hospitals, the scale of which is not possible to obtain from prospective observational studies. Additionally, the use of routine administrative data allows for the inclusion of cases who are often excluded from surveys due to poor health or inability to provide informed consent. The methods employed by medical coders, who analyse patient&#8217;s records, to endorse specific discharge clinical diagnoses means the attribution of AW is highly reliable as only emergent clinical sequalae of AW will be recorded by clinicians.</p><p>The findings from this study should be interpreted considering the following limitations. Routine administrative data are used for commissioning purposes in England and Wales, and therefore not collected in accordance with research principles, although the quality of these datasets has improved over time (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aylin et&#160;al. 2007</xref>). <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et&#160;al. (2019)</xref> identified those with any alcohol diagnosis as accounting for 9.2% of hospital admissions using previous HES-APC data, whereas <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#160;al. (2019)</xref> systematic review and meta-analysis identified a prevalence of 19.76% for harmful drinking and 10.25% for alcohol dependence in admitted adults in England, indicating that HES data provide a conservative estimate of need when compared to routine alcohol screening. Whilst HES data may under report alcohol-specific admissions, AW presentations are more likely than other forms of alcohol-related presentations to be classified correctly as the coding is based on observable clinical symptoms of withdrawal. The introduction of the NHS long-term plan has resulted in greater investment in hospital-based alcohol care teams since 2019 (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">NHS England 2019</xref>) with the aim of introducing hospital-wide routine alcohol screening. It is therefore possible that the introduction of routine and systematic screening of AUD and AW will increase the detection of cases and influence the recorded rate of those readmitted 30 days; however, it is unclear whether the assessments of hospital-based alcohol services will increase accuracy and frequency of coding within the HES-APC dataset. Missing data related to ethnicity are a concern as this inhibits our understanding of health inequalities and health outcomes for different ethnic groups. The work addressing consistency of ethnicity data recorded in health-related administrative datasets including HES-APC being undertaken by the Office of National Statistics (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">ONS 2024</xref>) should increase our understanding of alcohol interventions across all groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>Future research should build on the findings of this study to reduce 30-day readmission rates in patients experiencing AW. Community-based (e.g. general practice, district nursing) datasets could be linked to HES data to explore patient journeys and variables preceding or associated with 30-day readmission to strengthen the model developed here. Introduction of universal routine screening in acute hospitals will identify higher numbers of individuals at risk of AW which may indicate an initial increase in cost to the NHS; however, prospective studies should be designed to assess this and explore overall reduction in alcohol-related admissions, DAMA, and 30-day readmissions. Observational and prospective research should consider quality of treatment including level of prescribing of medication to treat AW symptoms. Qualitative work should be undertaken to explore staff and patient perspectives and data on reasons for DAMA and 30-day readmissions to acute hospitals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this analysis identifies implications for the alcohol treatment system in England, which during the same financial year identified 4720 individuals admitted to specialist alcohol inpatient care for AW (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">NDTMS 2025</xref>). Greater treatment capacity and access to specialist inpatient care and collaborative relationships between non-specialist and specialist provision is required to address the impact of emergency admissions requiring treatment for AW and subsequent readmission to hospital within 30&#160;days. Hospital-based alcohol liaison teams should aim to maximize the effectiveness of medically managed AW, consider active collaboration with specialist community service prior to discharge, but importantly support those subspecialist services such as community diabetic services, outpatient cardiology, and liver services and strong collaborations with community mental health teams, assertive outreach, and homeless services are essential to tailor care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary_Table_agaf022</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="supplementary_table_agaf022.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sup2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplementary_Table_2_26-04-25_agaf022</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="supplementary_table_2_26-04-25_agaf022.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="agaf022-ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This is independent research funded by the University of Hull and supported by the Hull Health Trials Unit Data Safe Haven.
