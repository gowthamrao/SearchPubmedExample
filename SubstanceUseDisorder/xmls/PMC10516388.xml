It is not uncommon for hand surgery patients to be overprescribed opioid medication for postoperative pain management. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in opioid prescription practices of hand surgeons treating Medicare Part D patients from 2013 to 2019.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A retrospective analysis of Medicare Part D prescriber data from 2013 to 2019 was conducted. This database provides information on drugs paid for under the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. For each prescriber and medication, the dataset includes the total number of prescriptions dispensed (original prescriptions and number of refills), and total medication cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 2013, the 10 most common medications prescribed totaled 114,409 prescriptions, with 89,701 (78.4%) opioid prescriptions. In 2019, the 10 most common medications prescribed totaled 164,955 prescriptions, with 109,665 (66.5%) opioid prescriptions. Although total opioid prescriptions dropped, there was a 22% increase in the total number of prescriptions written. The two most common medications prescribed, hydrocodone-acetaminophen and oxycodone-acetaminophen, totaled 75,796 in 2013, compared with 76,518 in 2019. The overall number of prescriptions for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increased by 157%, and the percentage of total opioids prescribed declined by 7.9%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The increase in total opioid prescriptions from 2013 to 2019 by hand surgeons in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program lags behind the recommended shift to nonopioid pain management.

With the majority of elective upper extremity surgical cases being performed as outpatient procedures, mainly on the soft tissues, excess opioid analgesics could potentially become a source for diversion, or illegal distribution. The number of opioid pills prescribed after a carpal tunnel release is two to five times more than the average number of pills consumed by the patient.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Acknowledging this alarming trend, guidelines for opioid prescriptions after hand surgery have led to a decrease in overprescribing while still attempting to adequately control postoperative pain.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, the effectiveness of these guidelines remains unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize the changes and trends in opioid prescription practices of hand surgeons treating Medicare Part D enrollees from 2013 to 2019.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Data</title><p>A retrospective analysis was performed using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D prescriber data from all years between 2013 and 2019.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This dataset provides information on the medications prescribed by healthcare providers and paid for via the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program.

In 2018 and 2019, despite the total number of claims holding steady, a decreased percentage of the top 10 analgesic prescriptions were opioids. Nonopioid analgesic prescriptions increased slightly in the years, leading up to the White House announcement but rose more sharply after the announcement. The drop in opioid prescriptions also follows the opioid prescribing guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March 2016. The guidelines encourage the prescriber to determine the overall need for opioids; consider their selection, dosage, follow-up, and completion; and assess and address the risks and harm of opioid use with the patient.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>This study shows that there is a promising decline in the opioids most commonly prescribed to Medicare patients after hand surgery; however, to maintain this trajectory, it is important to establish concrete plans to continue to address the opioid crisis. One method is to ensure that patients receive adequate education regarding expectations of postoperative pain and its management. A randomized control trial conducted in 2021 found that hand surgery patients used no opioids after minor soft tissue hand surgery if they received adequate education. This education program discussed the expected pain after surgery with emphasis on a tiered system of pain management with focus on nonpharmaceutical modalities of pain relief (rest, ice, elevate), followed by nonopioid pain medication with opioids used for breakthrough pain. Furthermore, the study found that pain and the number of pills prescribed were the only statistically significant variables associated with increased opioid use.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Likewise, prescriber education and adherence to prescription guidelines significantly decreased the number of pills prescribed per procedure, with one study showing a 52% decrease in prescriptions after a 1-hour opioid education program.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> A study by Stepan et al showed that preeducation to posteducation number of opioid prescriptions fell to almost half. These studies, however, do not detail who the prescribers are.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The aforementioned study also shows that the average and range for carpal tunnel and trigger finger release surgeries were 20 (5&#8211;45) and 20 (4&#8211;40) opioid pills prescribed, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> These numbers of pills prescribed for minor soft tissue surgery are exceedingly high for a surgeon to prescribe. However, with the trend of most orthopedic or plastic surgery hand offices having physician assistants or nurse practitioners perform medication and discharge paperwork reconciliation, it may be enlightening to analyze the effects of operating room exposure and opioid prescription education on prescribing practices of nurse practitioners and physician assistants and compare those with the prescribing practices of the leading surgeons.</p><p>With the development of new surgical approaches to limit general anesthesia, there is even greater potential for a reduction in opioid prescriptions. A study conducted in 2021 found that the use of wide-awake, local anesthesia, no-tourniquet (WALANT) hand surgery did not require opioid pain management, and most patients could comfortably manage their pain using NSAIDs alone.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> WALANT surgery provides for multiple advantages over conventional surgery. This improves the comfort of the patient before surgery eliminating the requirement for <italic toggle="yes">nil per os</italic> and, thus, many preoperative time restrictions. Local anesthetic in combinations with epinephrine is administered by the surgeon in preoperative holding area to allow for epinephrine to take full vasoconstrictive effect, thus negating the need for a tourniquet. Additionally, the patient may participate in a hand examination during surgery, for example to make a fist after A1 pulley release in trigger finger and ensure its full release. Lastly, the use of WALANT negates the need for general anesthesia, thus eliminating its side effects and allowing the patients to recover faster.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Another metric this study analyzed was the change in cost per claim from 2013 to 2019 for each drug. Cost per claim is a measure of the average cost incurred by the hospital to handle the unit cost of a given drug or claim.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Of the seven drugs that were compared from 2013 to 2019, six saw a decline in cost per claim but one, oxycodone-acetaminophen, saw an increase. When categorizing individual medications into NSAIDs or opioids, NSAIDs saw a larger average percentage decrease in cost per claim (&#8722;39%) compared with opioids (&#8722;26%). A decline in cost per claim can be interpreted in various ways, but ultimately suggests fewer costs are being incurred for the hospital organization. Cost may be reduced by a variety of factors, including economies of scale, improved access to claims, cheaper raw resources, and more, but it is unclear what may be driving the trends seen in this study based on the provided data alone.</p><p>It is promising to see that there are larger declines in the cost per claim for NSAIDs, as there is an innate incentive to prescribe in a manner that would minimize costs for the organization. When looking closer at the dollar amounts for the cost per unit of individual medications, diclofenac-sodium has a significantly higher cost compared with all the other selected drugs, at $76.30 per unit in 2013 and $42.91 per unit in 2019. Even though it saw a 44% decline in cost per unit, there is more room for improvement in its overall cost per claim. By continuing to reduce the costs of prescribing NSAIDs compared with opioids, there is the potential of creating another avenue of incentive for prescribers to utilize NSAIDs over opioids.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this study. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database only includes information from those enrolled in Medicare Part D, most of whom are age 65 and older. This excludes patients who have private insurance or self-pay, limiting the generalizability of this study. Additionally, this database does not provide details about the specific procedures performed, or the entirety of patients&#8217; treatment regimens. It is unclear how many prescriptions were provided to each patient, as well as the dosages of these prescriptions. The term hand surgeon is also not clarified in this database, and it is unclear if these surgeons were fellowship trained. The database also only includes data from 2013 through 2019, excluding any year before 2013 and the last three most recent years of drug prescriptions under Medicare Part D. It is important to note that when analyzing cost trends, it is difficult to determine to what degree these trends were impacted by inflation.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Directions</title><p>To continue the trend of decreased opioid distribution after hand surgery, more work is necessary. For example, it would be beneficial to know how costs can affect patient choices regarding pain control, and why the costs of certain prescription drugs have declined or increased. It may also be useful to know how else patients typically choose to treat their pain, as the data from this database do not provide the whole story in terms of their medication regimens. In addition, continued advancements in the world of WALANT surgery may contribute to further decline in the need for pain control via opioids.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Although the total number of opioid prescriptions by hand surgeons in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program increased from 2013 to 2019, the percentage of opioids in the top 10 total analgesic prescriptions declined. Additionally, NSAID prescriptions increased, both in total number and as a percentage of total prescriptions. This is a promising trend; however, further analysis of these trends is necessary to work toward a stable, continued decline of opioid prescriptions after hand surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>DISCLOSURE</title><p>The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
