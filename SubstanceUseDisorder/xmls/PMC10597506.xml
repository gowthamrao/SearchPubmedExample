We accessed and linked coronial data on all opioid toxicity deaths in Ontario with correctional data for people aged 18 years and older who were incarcerated in a provincial correctional facility. We used data from the Statistics Canada Census to calculate whole population rates. We used an interrupted time series design and segmented regression to assess for change in the level or rate of increase in deaths due to opioid toxicity coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the impact of COVID-19 on the opioid toxicity death rates for people exposed and not exposed to incarceration.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Rates of opioid toxicity death increased with a linear positive slope in both persons exposed to incarceration and those not exposed over the study period. The start of COVID-19 measures coincided with a marked upward shift in the trend lines with modification of the effect of COVID-19 by both sex and exposure to incarceration. For persons exposed to incarceration, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.50 (95%CI 1.35&#8211;1.69) for males and 1.21 (95%CI 1.06&#8211;1.42) for females, and for persons not exposed to incarceration, the RR was 1.25 (95%CI 1.13&#8211;1.38) for males and not significant for females.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>COVID-19 substantially exacerbated the risk of opioid toxicity death, impacting males and females who experienced incarceration more than those who had not, with an immediate stepwise increase in risk but no change in the rate of increase of risk over time.

The days and weeks immediately after release from prison are particularly hazardous, with very high rates of death from drug toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. People transitioning from prison to community face significant challenges including a lack of continuity of health care, criminal record-related impediments to employment, a lack of affordable housing and transportation, and difficulty navigating a complex system of government and community-based services [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Coupled with decreased drug tolerance that commonly occurs during incarceration [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in the context of a toxic illicit drug supply, these challenges likely contribute to the increased risk of fatal drug poisoning among people leaving prison.</p><p>The drug toxicity crisis has worsened over the past two decades and has disproportionately impacted people who experience incarceration [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since 2016, the crisis has been largely fuelled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogues and an unregulated drug supply which is unpredictable in composition [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The emergence of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has been associated with further exacerbation of substance use and drug-related deaths in North America and Europe [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] through several mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While there is a lack of primary data supporting causal linkages between COVID-19 and increases in deaths by drug toxicity, theoretical mechanisms have been proposed based on available evidence [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, pandemic-related restrictions including physical distancing measures and reduced capacity and hours of service posed challenges to direct service provision for people who use drugs [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other pandemic-related factors that may have contributed to drug-related deaths include stress, social isolation, worsening mental illness and feelings of despair, reductions in staff resources due to reallocation to the pandemic response, and border restrictions that contributed to a more volatile unregulated drug supply [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater likelihood of adulteration, falsification, and substitution of synthetic opioids, which may increase the risk of unintentional overdose [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Within correctional facilities, measures to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 included increased time in cells, restrictions on programming and care access, and limited visits and social interactions [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], all of which may worsen mental health and negatively impact transitions to the community.</p><p>While increased drug toxicity deaths coinciding with the pandemic have been observed across North America, we lack data on the impact of the pandemic on people who experience incarceration. We identified only one relevant observational study, which compared overdose rates three months after release from jail among people with opioid use disorder in Massachusetts before and during the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. That study found that people released in the first six months of the pandemic experienced three times higher odds of overdose mortality than people released in the six months preceding (odds ratio = 3.06, 95%CI 1.49&#8211;6.26) [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The current study aims to expand on these findings by estimating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on opioid toxicity mortality in custody and post-release for people who experienced incarceration using a whole population cohort over a 6-year period, and to compare with people who did not experience incarceration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General operates all provincial correctional institutions in Ontario (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., facilities for adults who are on remand awaiting trial or sentencing, or who have been sentenced to less than two years in custody) and oversees and delivers health care in these facilities. Persons sentenced to two years or more in custody are transferred from provincial facilities to federal penitentiaries.</p><p>We accessed data from the Ministry of the Solicitor General (&#8220;correctional data&#8221;) for all persons aged 18 and older who were detained or incarcerated in an Ontario provincial correctional facility between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020, including name, date of birth, sex, Indigenous identity, marital status, race, periods of admission to and release from custody, and reasons for release. In this paper, we use &#8220;incarcerated&#8221; to describe persons who were detained or incarcerated in provincial correctional facilities.</p><p>We accessed data from the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario (&#8220;coronial data&#8221;) for all deaths from opioid toxicity between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020, including name, date of birth, sex, and date of death. In Ontario, there is a legal obligation to report any death from opioid toxicity to a coroner. Opioid toxicity deaths include all sudden and unexpected deaths where an opioid was identified in post-mortem toxicology and was determined to have directly contributed to the cause of death, either alone or in combination with other substances.</p><p>We linked coronial data for people who died from opioid toxicity between 2015 and 2020 to correctional data for people who experienced incarceration over this same period, using name, date of birth and sex, using Link Plus version 2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Link Plus produces all possible matches and assigns a score, with higher scores indicating a more likely match. The scores are based on how well each of the elements (first, middle and last name, date of birth and sex) match. The study team reviewed specific matches and came to consensus regarding whether to consider them valid. After we completed data linkage, we used deidentified data for all subsequent analyses.</p><p>Data for the whole population were based on Ontario data from the Canadian census, conducted in 2016 and 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with annual population estimates determined using linear interpolation by age and sex.</p><p>Our <italic toggle="yes">exposed</italic> group was adults who were incarcerated for any period in an Ontario provincial correctional facility between 2015 and 2020, and our <italic toggle="yes">unexposed</italic> group was all other adults in the general population in Ontario. Persons entered the exposed group from the date of their first incarceration during the study period and contributed person time to the exposed group up to the end of the study or death, whether they remained in custody or were released to the community. We use the term &#8220;people exposed to incarceration&#8221; to describe the exposed group. Our <italic toggle="yes">unexposed</italic> group was everyone in the general population after removing people who had been exposed to provincial incarceration during the study period.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Analyses</title><p>For those exposed to incarceration, we calculated descriptive statistics for age, marital status, cumulative time in custody, length of most recent incarceration and number of total corrections admissions during the period under study, stratified by sex.</p><p>To determine whether COVID-19 impacted people exposed to incarceration differently from the unexposed group, we used an interrupted time series (ITS) design, a quasi-experimental approach for evaluating effects of interventions that occurs at a specific point in time [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In an ITS study, data collected at multiple time points before and after an intervention or event are used to estimate the effects of the intervention or event [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In segmented regression, the change in intercept and/or slope pre- to post-intervention is used to test a causal hypothesis about the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For the current study, segmented regression was used to determine whether there was a change in level and/or slope in the rate of opioid-related deaths pre-post COVID-19, and to compare rates of death and the COVID-19-related changes in rates of death among people exposed to incarceration to the rates and changes in rates among people not exposed to incarceration.</p><p>The number of opioid-related deaths and time at risk were calculated by month. Rate of death was calculated as the number of deaths per 10,000 person years at risk. For the ITS analyses, COVID-19 was treated as an event which occurred on April 1, 2020. Pandemic measures such as the closure of nonessential businesses began on March 23, 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and so April is the first complete month in which restrictions were in place. Opioid-related deaths were allocated to age groups based on the deceased person&#8217;s age at time of death using the date of birth in the coronial data.</p><p>We conducted a multivariable negative binomial regression with a robust estimate of the error variance to model the number of opioid toxicity deaths over the study period. The explanatory variables were age group (18&#8211;24, 25&#8211;39, 40&#8211;49 and 50+), sex (male, female), population (exposed to incarceration, not exposed), and month (from January 2015 to December 2020). Two additional variables were included in the regression: COVID-19 (a binary variable which is 0 until March 2020 and 1 starting in April 2020, allowing the <italic toggle="yes">level</italic> of the rate to change), and a variable, equal to 0 up to March 2020 and equal to the number of months since COVID-19 restrictions, starting with April 2020 = 1, which allowed the <italic toggle="yes">slope</italic> to change over time following the imposition of pandemic-related restrictions. Interactions allowed for the possibility that trends in death rate would vary by age, sex, and population, and that the impact of COVID-19 would differ by age, sex, and population. There is one observation for each combination of age, sex, population and month. The outcome variable was the number of deaths for each observation. The natural log (ln) of time at risk for incarceration was the offset variable. The rates were checked for autocorrelation, checking separately by sex and exposure to incarceration, up to a lag of 12, which would allow for a seasonality effect.</p><p>We also performed a segmented Cox proportional hazards survival analysis using the counting style approach to look at whether death rates within the exposed group (those who experience incarceration) changed based on period post-release, whether that association changed over time, and whether the association changed with COVID-19. Each person&#8217;s history was divided into short time segments. A new time segment was started each time the person transitioned in or out of custody. While the person was either incarcerated or in the community, a new time segment was started every 30 days. Each time segment for a given person was characterized by their sex, age at the start of the time segment, incarceration/community status at the start of the time segment, and by the month in which the time segment starts, from January 2015 to December 2020. Incarceration/community status was first categorized as either &#8216;in custody&#8217; or &#8216;in community,&#8217; with the &#8216;in community&#8217; group being further categorized into four groups by the number of days since their last incarceration: days 1&#8211;30; days 31&#8211;200; days 201&#8211;365; and more than 1 year in community. An interaction between the effect of COVID-19 and incarceration/community status (considering all five groups defined above) allowed the impact of COVID-19 to differ depending on whether the person was in custody or in one of the periods after release from custody.</p><p>Analyses were performed in SAS version 10.0 [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

In this model (<xref rid="pone.0293251.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), age was independently associated with risk of death from opioid toxicity, with those aged 25&#8211;39 and 40&#8211;49 years at increased risk compared to those aged 18&#8211;24. The interaction between sex and exposure was such that both males and females who were exposed to incarceration were at greater risk of opioid toxicity death than males and females not exposed to incarceration before COVID-19 (rate ratio (RR) for exposed males was 24.73 (95%CI 22.84&#8211;26.77)), and RR for exposed females was 66.79, (95%CI 59.26&#8211;75.29). Further, among those exposed to incarceration, females were at higher risk of opioid toxicity death than males (RR 1.32, 95%CI 1.09&#8211;1.59); however, among those not exposed to incarceration, the inverse was true (RR 0.49, 95%CI 0.42&#8211;0.58). There was a significant increase in risk per month following January 2015, but no interaction between the period of COVID-19 and month (p = 0.60), indicating no change in the slope associated with COVID-19 restrictions. However, the level changed significantly, and furthermore the change in level depended on sex (p-value for the interaction &lt; .0001) and exposure to incarceration (p-value for the interaction &lt; .0001). COVID-19 affected the exposed more than the unexposed and males more than females, so that the pre-COVID-19 trends were accentuated. Specifically, the regression found no significant impact of COVID-19 for females not exposed to incarceration but an RR of 1.25 for males not exposed to incarceration (95%CI = 1.13&#8211;1.37). Among individuals exposed to incarceration, the RR was 1.21 (95%CI 1.05&#8211;1.40) for females and 1.50 (95%CI = 1.34&#8211;1.69) for males.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0293251.t002" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0293251.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Risk ratios from multivariable negative binomial regression for the effect of COVID-19 on the risk of opioid toxicity death, by age, sex and exposure to incarceration for people exposed to incarceration in Ontario provincial correctional facilities between January 2015 and December 2020.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0293251.t002g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0293251.t002.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Risk ratio</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95% confidence interval</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value<xref rid="t002fn002" ref-type="table-fn"><sup>a</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

We found significant differences in the increase in risk during the COVID-19 period between people exposed and not exposed to incarceration, as well as by sex. Consistent with pre-pandemic studies [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], females exposed to incarceration continued to be at greater risk of death by opioid toxicity compared to females who were not exposed to incarceration. However, males exposed to incarceration were most significantly impacted by COVID-19 in terms of the increased risk of death. The highest risk period for death by opioid toxicity was in the first 30 days after release from custody. We did not identify a differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic based on whether people exposed to incarceration were in custody or in the community post-release.</p><p>After the pandemic was declared, governments across Canada implemented a range of public health measures to limit the spread of the virus. By the end of March 2020, all Canadian provinces mandated closing universities, schools, public playgrounds and non-essential businesses [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other measures included physical distancing, work-from-home requirements, limitations on the size of gatherings, canceling non-essential surgeries to increase hospital capacity, travel restrictions, testing, and contact tracing. The pandemic and response measures impacted trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while increases in drug prices, decreases in drug availability, and more drug adulteration were all documented since the start of the pandemic in Canada and in other jurisdictions [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The pandemic, through mechanisms other than COVID-19 infection, substantially increased the risk of death by opioid toxicity across North America [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This study contributes to emerging evidence that the pandemic further increased the already substantially elevated risk of death by opioid toxicity specifically for people who experience incarceration. The complex interplay between COVID-19 and opioid use has important implications for efforts to prepare for future public health emergencies, as well as ongoing responses to the lasting population and public health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Our study has several strengths and limitations. We used whole population data, and given legally mandated reporting of deaths to coroners, we expect that the study has a high level of outcome ascertainment. Our outcome of interest is opioid toxicity deaths but for many of these deaths, other substances may have contributed to death (i.e., synergistic effects of different substances). We defined our exposure based on incarceration in provincial correctional facilities between the specific period of 2015 to 2020, and the ITS analyses included people who had an incarceration at <italic toggle="yes">any point</italic> in this six-year period. The mechanisms associated with incarceration history and risk of death from opioid toxicity are complex, as the population of people who experience incarceration faces substantial health and social inequities that elevate their risk of death, including childhood adversity and trauma, poverty, racism, low levels of education, under/unemployment, homelessness and precarious housing [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Concurrent use of multiple drugs has also been identified as a key risk factor for drug-related deaths in the general population and limited research has found more common and more extensive polysubstance use patterns among people with criminal justice system involvement [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>We did not describe available data on race and Indigenous identity, as we did not have necessary partnerships in place to do so [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our study includes only the first year of the pandemic and future research is required to determine the longer-term impacts of pandemic measures, which evolved and fluctuated over time. Finally, qualitative research is required to understand the experiences of people exposed to incarceration and the specific mechanisms of increased risk of adverse outcomes related to the pandemic and prison.</p><p>People who experience incarceration are at substantially greater risk of death by opioid toxicity compared with others in the general population. Increased deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic may be attributable to pandemic-related restrictions in services for people who use drugs [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293251.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as changes in conditions in custody such as greater isolation and less discharge planning, and in the community such as worse housing access and an increasingly toxic drug supply [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additional research is needed to look all substances contributing to overdose deaths, which may be differential for those exposed to incarceration compared to those who are not exposed. There is an urgent need to monitor and test the drug supply and drug exposures through drug checking, testing of seized drugs, and toxicology for people on relevant treatments [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and to inform individual and population-level strategies (e.g., education and resources for people who use drugs, toxic drug alerts, increasing availability of supervised drug use settings, and strategies to address the toxic drug supply including pharmaceutical alternatives). As part of a broader public health agenda to address the health harms of incarceration, future emergency preparedness efforts should explicitly consider the prison setting and people who experience incarceration [<xref rid="pone.0293251.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge the Ontario Office of the Chief Coroner and Ministry of the Solicitor General for providing data for this study and for supporting data linkage.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0293251.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Zlodre</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Fazel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>All-cause and external mortality in released prisoners: systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title>. <source>American journal of public health</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>102</volume>(<issue>12</issue>):<fpage>e67</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>e75</lpage>.

The article has an element of novelty that makes it a relevant and valuable contribution to toxicological research. In addition, the manuscript is well assembled and competently structured. The well explicated methodology is also a plus.</p><p>It would be advisable to lay out a higher degree of contextualization as to the COVID-19 pandemic and substance use, since such highly complex dynamics and trends are not comprehensively outlined in the article. Furthermore, how synthetic opioids and NPS use was impacted by the pandemic may also be worthy of analysis in the discussion. The following sources should be drawn upon and cited:</p><p>doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00563.</p><p>doi: 10.1016/j.bja.2020.07.004.</p><p>doi: 10.1002/hup.2727.</p><p>doi: 10.1016/<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://j.euroneuro.2021.09.002" ext-link-type="uri">j.euroneuro.2021.09.002</ext-link>.</p><p>doi: 10.3390/biology12020273.</p><p>The artcle is well-written and offers an insightful perspective and analysis.</p><p>Best regards.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;I was called upon the review the submission by the title The impact of COVID-19 on opioid toxicity deaths for people who experience incarceration compared to the general population in Ontario: A whole population data linkage study.</p><p>The chief quality of the article I feel like pointing out is originality: the analysis comparing inmates to the general population is insightful; in addition, the methodological soundness the authors managed to achieve is noteworthy. The figures and tables have been well-crafted and are effective and straightforward in conveying key data and findings.</p><p>Certainly, I feel it would be advisable to provide a broader analytical perspective in the Discussion section, by briefly expounding upon opioids use and how screening and detection play a key role in tackling trafficking and abuse trends, also in reference to polydrug use, in prison vs general polulations.</p><p>The following sources can be looked at and added to the references:</p><p>doi: 10.3390/biology11050645.</p><p>doi: 10.1002/anie.202101262.</p><p>doi: 10.1093/jat/bks063.</p><p>The article is well written praiseworthy, especially as it relates to its stated goal.</p><p>I look forward to an improved revised version soon.</p><p>**********</p><p>6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>).

Our responses are provided below.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Dear Authors,</p><p>- I have been tasked with reviewing the manuscript titled The impact of COVID-19 on opioid toxicity deaths for people who experience incarceration compared to the general population in Ontario: A whole population data linkage study.</p><p>I have certainly appreciated the depth and thoroughness the authors managed to achieve in terms of the stated objective. The article has an element of novelty that makes it a relevant and valuable contribution to toxicological research. In addition, the manuscript is well assembled and competently structured. The well explicated methodology is also a plus.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your positive feedback. </p><p>- It would be advisable to lay out a higher degree of contextualization as to the COVID-19 pandemic and substance use, since such highly complex dynamics and trends are not comprehensively outlined in the article. Furthermore, how synthetic opioids and NPS use was impacted by the pandemic may also be worthy of analysis in the discussion. The following sources should be drawn upon and cited:</p><p>doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00563.</p><p>doi: 10.1016/j.bja.2020.07.004.</p><p>doi: 10.1002/hup.2727.</p><p>doi: 10.1016/<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://j.euroneuro.2021.09.002" ext-link-type="uri">j.euroneuro.2021.09.002</ext-link>.</p><p>doi: 10.3390/biology12020273.</p><p>Response:</p><p>In the introduction, we discuss the complex dynamics associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and substance use. For reference, we provide the following content: </p><p>&#8220;While there is a lack of primary data supporting causal linkages between COVID-19 and increases in deaths by drug toxicity, theoretical mechanisms have been proposed based on available evidence (19). For example, pandemic-related restrictions including physical distancing measures and reduced capacity and hours of service posed challenges to direct service provision for people who use drugs (20, 21). Other pandemic-related factors that may have contributed to drug-related deaths include stress, social isolation, worsening mental illness and feelings of despair, reductions in staff resources due to reallocation to the pandemic response, and border restrictions that contributed to a more volatile unregulated drug supply (15, 19). Within correctional facilities, measures to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 included increased time in cells, restrictions on programming and care access, and limited visits and social interactions (22), all of which may worsen mental health and negatively impact transitions to the community.&#8221;</p><p>We appreciate that recommendation to include papers about novel psychoactive substances (NPS). In the introduction we acknowledge that fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have dominated the illicit drug supply. We added Rinaldi et al. (2020) to the following sentence:</p><p>"The pandemic and response measures impacted trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs (19), while increases in drug prices, decreases in drug availability, and more drug adulteration were all documented since the start of the pandemic in Canada and other jurisdictions (20, 31)."</p><p>We added Pichini et al. (2020) to the following sentence: &#8220;The emergence of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has been associated with further exacerbation of substance use and drug-related deaths in North America and Europe (14-18) through several mechanisms (19)." </p><p>We added the following sentence and cited Torrens and Fonseca (2022): &#8220;As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater likelihood of adulteration, falsification, and substitution of synthetic opioids, which may increase the risk of unintentional overdose (23).&#8221; </p><p>For this paper, we are focusing specifically on opioid-related deaths (not the increased risk of death by COVID or other illnesses among people who use substances). As such, Lambert 2020 is not relevant.</p><p>- The article is well-written and offers an insightful perspective and analysis.</p><p>Response: Thank you. </p><p>Best regards.</p><p>Reviewer #2: I was called upon the review the submission by the title The impact of COVID-19 on opioid toxicity deaths for people who experience incarceration compared to the general population in Ontario: A whole population data linkage study.</p><p>The chief quality of the article I feel like pointing out is originality: the analysis comparing inmates to the general population is insightful; in addition, the methodological soundness the authors managed to achieve is noteworthy. The figures and tables have been well-crafted and are effective and straightforward in conveying key data and findings.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your positive feedback. </p><p>- Certainly, I feel it would be advisable to provide a broader analytical perspective in the Discussion section, by briefly expounding upon opioids use and how screening and detection play a key role in tackling trafficking and abuse trends, also in reference to polydrug use, in prison vs general populations.</p><p>The following sources can be looked at and added to the references:</p><p>doi: 10.3390/biology11050645.</p><p>doi: 10.1002/anie.202101262.</p><p>doi: 10.1093/jat/bks063.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We appreciate this feedback. Although we did not examine polysubstance use, we agree that this is an important risk factor for drug related deaths, particularly among incarcerated populations. We added the following to the discussion:</p><p>&#8220;Concurrent use of multiple drugs has also been identified as a key risk factor for drug-related deaths in the general population and limited research has found more extensive polysubstance use patterns among people with criminal justice system involvement (37, 38).&#8221;</p><p>The following has been added to the limitation section:</p><p> &#8220;Our outcome of interest is opioid toxicity deaths but for many of these deaths, other substances may have contributed to death (i.e., synergistic effects of different substances).&#8221;</p><p>The following was added to the discussion section and we cited Kroning and Wang (2021):</p><p>&#8220;Additional research is needed to look all substances contributing to overdose deaths, which may be differential for those exposed to incarceration compared to those who are not exposed. There is an urgent need to monitor and test the drug supply and drug exposures through drug checking, testing of seized drugs, and toxicology for people on relevant treatments (41), and to inform individual and population-level strategies (e.g., education and resources for people who use drugs, toxic drug alerts, increasing availability of supervised drug use settings, and strategies to address the toxic drug supply including pharmaceutical alternatives).&#8221;</p><p>- The article is well written praiseworthy, especially as it relates to its stated goal.</p><p>I look forward to an improved revised version soon.</p><p>Response: Thank you.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0293251.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PLOS One_Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0293251.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0293251.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0293251.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Zaami</surname><given-names initials="S">Simona</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Simona Zaami</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Simona Zaami</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0293251"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
