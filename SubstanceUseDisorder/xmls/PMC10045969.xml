Some patients with ILD do not clearly fall into either of these categories yet have features of autoimmunity. In 2015, European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society issued a joint statement for the classification of such patients and coined the term interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF).<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Similar to RD-ILD, IPAF affects women more frequently than men and the age of onset tends to be younger than some other ILD subtypes such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>In 2020, the American College of Rheumatology issued Guidelines on the Management of Reproductive Health in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The guidelines emphasized the need for family planning discussions in RD patients. Although these guidelines help practitioners navigate family planning in women with established RDs, they do not explicitly extend to women with ILD without a defined RD. Thus, there is little guidance on reproductive health counseling in IPAF patients despite the finding that family planning discussions improve pregnancy outcomes in patients with ILD.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Pregnancy outcomes among ILD patients are variable.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Some ILD patients have healthy pregnancies with minimal complications under close observation.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, pregnancy in women with uncontrolled pulmonary disease is high risk and has been associated with intrauterine growth restriction and maternal respiratory failure during labor and delivery.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Few studies have focused on outcomes for pregnancies of RD-ILD patients, and there are no studies that have focused on pregnancy outcomes for IPAF patients specifically.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Moreover, IPAF is frequently complicated by pulmonary vascular disease, including pulmonary hypertension (PH).<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Pulmonary hypertension is associated with high rates of maternal mortality,<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and current guidelines recommend against pregnancy in this patient population.<sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, SSA and SSB antibodies are frequently encountered in IPAF patients<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and are associated with neonatal lupus and congenital complete heart block.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The mainstay of therapy for IPAF consists of potentially teratogenic immunomodulating medications.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Thus, reproductive-aged female patients with IPAF need to be counseled about the importance of highly effective contraception while taking these medications. Pregnancy planning not only protects against inadvertent exposure to teratogenic medications but also ensures that patients have well-controlled disease on pregnancy compatible medications before conception.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of reproductive counseling documentation including family planning discussions and documentation of contraceptive use by rheumatology and pulmonary providers with female reproductive-aged IPAF patients seen at an academic medical center.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cohort Assembly</title><p>This single-center medical record review study was conducted at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Consecutive patients seen in the UTSW ILD Clinic between January 2005 and April 2019 who met the ERS/ATS classification criteria for IPAF<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> were identified, using a preexisting database established by coauthor (T.N.A.). For patients seen before 2015, IPAF classification criteria were retrospectively applied. Pulmonologist (T.N.A.) initially assigned patients to IPAF classification with rheumatologist (E.K.J.) subsequently and independently verifying the classification. Female patients aged 18 to 50 years at the time of initial ILD clinic visit were included. The UTSW Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the study before initiation of data extraction (IRB #STU-2019-0913).

Data extraction tools for consistent data collection and data recording in the worksheet were generated by rheumatologists E.K.J. and B.M. for this study. If data were missing (ie, SSA antibody), it was considered that the patient was not positive for the presence of that data variable.</p><p>We collected data from pulmonary and rheumatology clinic visits, medical, and surgical history as documented in EMR, medication lists, and procedure records. We extracted data on demographics, pulmonary function tests, PH data, medication use, SSA and SSB positivity, and documentation of family planning counseling and/or contraceptive use by pulmonary and rheumatology providers, during any visit, over the duration of the follow-up at ILD clinic. We also extracted data on whether the patient was seen by obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) providers during their follow-up at ILD clinic. Both pulmonology and rheumatology notes were generated by faculty, advanced practice providers, and trainees (clinical fellows). The UTSW uses the Epic EMR system, which is shared among all divisions at UTSW. All but one of the patients seen at the rheumatology clinic were also seen at the ILD clinic concurrently.

Factors</title><p>Differences in the rates of counseling by pulmonary and rheumatology providers based on baseline characteristics of women are described in Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. None of the demographic characteristics were significantly predictive of reproductive counseling documentation (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>Similar proportions of Black and White women had reproductive counseling documented during both pulmonary and rheumatology notes, although numerically fewer of the Hispanic women (1 of 7 who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino) had either contraceptive use or family planning discussion documented during any of their visits with either specialty. No other baseline characteristics contributed to documentation rates of reproductive counseling by rheumatology providers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussions"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In our study, family planning discussions and/or contraceptive counseling documentation among reproductive-aged women with IPAF was found in 33% of pulmonary encounters and 57% of rheumatology encounters. Although rheumatology providers were more likely to document discussions of family planning with their patients or ongoing contraception use than their pulmonary colleagues, this trend was not statistically significant. Use of teratogenic medications in these patients did not impact the rates of documentation. There was a nonsignificant trend for Hispanic patients to have lower percentage of reproductive counseling documentation. Patient's status of being seen by OB/GYN provider did not affect the odds of documentation of family planning discussion and contraception use by pulmonary and rheumatology providers.</p><p>Other studies have corroborated our findings of low rates of reproductive counseling between providers and high-risk patients. In a study of PH providers, only 9% of physicians reported discussing reproductive issues with patients at every visit.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Black and Hispanic/Latina women had lower odds of receiving contraceptive counseling,<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which was consistent with our study, with fewer Hispanic women having a documentation of reproductive counseling or contraceptive use. Similarly, the rheumatology literature also reports inconsistent family planning discussions with patients who would have high-risk pregnancies. Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on teratogenic medications were no more likely to receive contraceptive counseling than women on nonteratogenic medications.<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Several barriers could explain the inconsistent reproductive counseling documentation among the providers in our study. Insufficient encounter time, lack of ownership of this health care issue, lack of provider knowledge regarding family planning, and provider discomfort and/or patient resistance in discussing sensitive topics such as contraception and family planning could all contribute.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In addition, IPAF patients are complicated, and numerous topics may need to be discussed each visit, limiting the time for addressing health care maintenance such as reproductive health.</p><p>Strategies to improve both the presence and documentation of reproductive counseling among these at-risk patients include previsit questionnaires and nurse-led protocols. Education of both pulmonary and rheumatology providers on the importance of this topic could potentially increase these discussions. Other studies have shown that among rheumatology providers, simple interventions such as open-ended questions by providers regarding plans for pregnancy in the next year increase the family planning counseling in the clinic.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a recent study, women with RDs strongly wished for their rheumatology providers to initiate the discussion of pregnancy planning, highlighting the need for providers to initiate patient-provider communication on this topic.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Our study has several limitations including having a small sample size and being medical record review study, which may have led to missing data. It is possible that we did not capture all women with IPAF of childbearing age because we limited our cohort to patients seen in UTSW ILD clinic. Because all but 1 patient seen by rheumatology providers were also concurrently seen in pulmonary clinic, it is possible that, based on timing of visits and documentation, counseling was influenced by reviewing the other clinics' notes. Furthermore, we only evaluated documentation of counseling and birth control use based on the visit notes, which excludes nondocumented reproductive counseling.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the only study evaluating reproductive counseling documentation in IPAF patients specifically, and our findings highlight the need to address this health care gap in this particular population. We have access to both pulmonary and rheumatology clinic notes within the same medical center, which improves internal validity of the study and eliminates intercenter and interregional variability in the approach to family planning counseling.</p><p>In summary, this study highlights a critical health maintenance gap in the care of female patients with IPAF. Future studies will focus on elucidating reasons for the lack of counseling and counseling documentation, with the ultimate goal of improving awareness to counsel, strategies to communicate the risks, and mitigation measures to optimize pregnancy outcomes in this high-risk patient population.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>KEY POINTS</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Women with IPAF have risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Women with IPAF have a health care gap.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providers do not document reproductive counseling consistently.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No baseline characteristic was associated with counseling documentation in women with IPAF.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Dr Elena K.
