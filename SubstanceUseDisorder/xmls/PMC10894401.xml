A previous epidemiological survey conducted in China between June 22, 2012, and May 25, 2015, found that the overall prevalence of asthma was 4.2%, representing 45.7 million Chinese adults (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The incidence of childhood asthma in China is also increasing year by year (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), which has a huge impact on the spirit and economy of the affected children&#8217;s families. A systematic review estimated that by 2020 the highest incidence of childhood asthma in China would be in 4-year-old urban boys (10.27%), while the lowest would be in 14-year-old rural girls (1.11%) (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Indoor and outdoor pollutants affect respiratory health, increasing the prevalence and triggering the symptoms of asthma, and this effect is more pronounced in all age groups in women. Among children with allergic predisposition, positive associations between air pollutants and respiratory symptoms and diseases have been detected in females (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Among girls, but not boys, lifetime exposures to black carbon [a constituent of traffic-related particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5)] and PM2.5 are associated with greater odds of early and mid-childhood asthma (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Adult women living in households that use biomass and solid fuels have a significantly higher risk of asthma than those living in households that use cleaner fuels, even after controlling for a number of potentially confounding factors, but this effect has not been found among men (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of developing asthma, and PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) increase the risk of developing wheezing, the cardinal symptom of asthma, in adult women (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Mishra (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) examined the effect of cooking smoke on the reported prevalence of asthma among elderly men and women, and found that the adjusted effect of cooking smoke on asthma was greater among women than among men.</p><p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and its incidence, prevalence, and severity vary by sex and age. In the pediatric population, boys have a higher prevalence of asthma than girls due to different sex hormone production and relatively delayed lung development, but the prevalence and severity of asthma are higher in women than in men in adulthood (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><italic toggle="yes">Figure 1</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The incidence, prevalence, and severity of asthma in men and women are not only influenced by important factors such as sex hormones, genetics, society, and environment, but are also associated with patients&#8217; response to asthma treatment. In female patients, the fluctuation in hormone levels in infancy, adolescence, menstrual cycle, pregnancy and lactation, climacterium, menopause, and postmenopausal period; and the transition of various social roles such as from marriage to child rearing, family burden, and responsibility lead to the onset of asthma, making the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma in women quite challenging. In addition, gene expression, epigenetic modification, and different patients&#8217; responses to environmental stimuli such as SARS-CoV-2 infection are also associated with the differences in the incidence, prevalence, and symptoms of asthma in men and women.</p><fig position="float" id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Global prevalence of asthma among males and female.

These experts have extensive experience in the fields of female growth and development, endocrine and sex hormone changes and their effects on the female immune system, as well as the diagnosis, treatment, and management of female asthma.

Estrogen stimulates lung maturation, and estrogen receptors &#945; and &#946; (ER&#945; and ER&#946;) are expressed in the lungs. Estrogen, ER&#945;, and ER&#946; are important for alveolar surfactant production and alveolar development, and androgens partially regulate the morphology of pulmonary branches and inhibit the production of surfactant (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). During the fetal period, female individuals produce alveolar surfactant earlier than males, which promotes the opening of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli, thereby speeding up air flow and reducing airway resistance. Therefore, the morbidity and mortality of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome are higher in males (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Early postnatal lung development and maturation are mainly achieved by increasing the alveolar number and volume growth. Women have smaller lung volumes than men, and their airways grow proportionally to their lungs, resulting in higher forced expiratory flow. Airway growth lags behind the lung growth in men, and the total number and surface area of alveoli are greater in men throughout childhood. Therefore, boys have smaller airway diameters relative to their lung volume and present more pronounced lung dysplasia associated with airway flow velocity (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>During adolescence, men produce greater respiratory pressure than women due to androgens and changes in the shape of the chest and respiratory muscles. Forced vital capacity increases more rapidly in women, however, it is higher in men, which results in a larger alveolar surface area and greater carbon monoxide diffusion capacity in men (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). When growth and development stop, men have greater vital capacity, total lung capacity, and peak flow compared with women of the same height.

In late childhood (after eight years of age), the inhibitory state of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is relieved, and follicles in the ovaries develop to some extent and secrete sex hormones, but they are still immature. In girls, adolescence begins at the age of 8&#8211;10 years. GnRH is released in pulses; follicles develop and secrete estrogen, and estrogen reaches adult levels by the age of 12 years. In boys, testosterone rises markedly at the age of 10&#8211;11 years. During this time estradiol begins to decline, adolescence begins, and androgen reaches adult levels after the age of 14 years. Since adolescence, the prevalence and severity of asthma in women are higher than those in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Menstrual period</title><p>On the seventh day of menstruation, estrogen secreted by follicles increases rapidly and reaches the peak before ovulation. The release of estrogen in the follicular fluid after ovulation results in the decrease of circulating estrogen. One-to-two days after ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes estrogen, which leads to the increase of circulating estrogen, and secretes a small amount of progesterone at the same time. By the time the corpus luteum matures seven-to-eight days after ovulation, the secretion of estrogen and progesterone reaches the peak. Afterwards, the corpus luteum atrophies, and the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall to their lowest level during menstruation (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig"><italic toggle="yes">Figure 2</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

Chorionic gonadotropin is secreted by the placenta. It can be detected from maternal serum on the first day after the implantation of the fertilized egg, peaks at 8&#8211;10 weeks of pregnancy, rapidly decreases later, and disappears within two weeks after delivery. Estrogen is mainly produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary in the first trimester and is synthesized mainly by the placenta after 10 weeks of pregnancy. The level of estrogen in pregnancy gradually increases, reaching a peak in the third trimester, and then drops rapidly to a lower level in a short period after delivery. Progesterone mainly comes from the corpus luteum of the ovary within six weeks of pregnancy and is mainly secreted by the placenta in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The level of progesterone in pregnancy gradually increases, reaching the highest value before delivery, and then falls to normal level within a few days after delivery. Asthma is a common complication during pregnancy. It can worsen, improve, or remain stable during pregnancy, and sex hormones play an important role. However, the exact mechanism of how hormones affect asthma is unknown. Oxytocin and prolactin are often elevated in lactating women, which may cause the fluctuation of asthma, but the exacerbation of postpartum asthma is rare.</p></sec><sec><title>Menopause</title><p>In the early stage of menopause, the estrogen level fluctuates greatly and is occasionally higher than that in the normal follicular phase. With the gradual exhaustion of ovarian function, follicles completely stop developing, the estrogen level rapidly decreases, and progesterone decreases earlier than estrogen.

ICS and oral LTRA are the most commonly used medications; inhaled LABA can be used for concomitant medication in older children. Inhaled SABA can rapidly relax airway smooth muscle and relieve acute asthma symptoms, so it is the preferred drug for the treatment of acute onset of asthma in children. Common SABAs include albuterol and terbutaline. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that can be combined with SABA by atomizing inhalation for the treatment of moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation in children. Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory effects and can effectively reduce respiratory edema and secretion during acute asthma exacerbation. Systemic corticosteroids have a slow onset of action, with oral formulations taking effect after at least two hours; they are indicated in children with moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation and also in children with mild asthma exacerbation refractory to inhaled beta agonists alone. Montelukast, a LTRA, can effectively reduce or prevent asthma symptoms in children with intermittent asthma and viral infection-related wheezing.

Patients with moderate persistent asthma are treated with daily control regimen to prevent exacerbation, combined with rescue medication to control symptoms. Low-dose ICS is recommended as the main control drug, and low-dose ICS + LABA compound inhaler can be used. Severe persistent asthma refers to asthma requiring high-dose ICS, or requiring continuous oral corticosteroids (OCS) for control, or never achieving control despite the treatment. Initial control drugs for such patients include OCS or ICS and LABA, and LTRA can be selected for patients who cannot be adequately controlled with high-dose ICS combined with LABA. Patients whose symptoms are not controlled by high-dose ICS and one or more non-GC control drugs should have their diagnosis reviewed. Biologics may be considered appropriate in children who meet age and other conditions. Potential options and investigational therapies include immunomodulatory therapy and macrolide antibiotics (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, a thorough evaluation by an experienced specialist is required.</p><p>Patients with active asthma should undergo routine follow-up every 1 to 6 months based on the severity of asthma. Asthma control, lung function, episodes, inhaler usage, compliance, adverse drug reactions, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with treatment should be assessed at the follow-up. Each follow-up visit requires an assessment of symptoms past 4 weeks, including daytime symptoms, nighttime awakening due to asthma symptoms, frequency of symptom relief with SABA, and difficulty with normal activities and movements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of PMA and therapeutic management</title><sec><title>Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment</title><list list-type="roman-upper" id="L3"><list-item><p>Standardized recording of respiratory symptoms and peak flow levels during the menstrual cycle is an effective tool for diagnosing the disease.

If premenstrual asthma is identified, prophylactic drugs, such as montelukast or ketotifen, may be administered orally several days before the day of menstruation (1C); progesterone should be injected promptly before menstruation to prevent a sudden decrease in progesterone levels; and danazol should be used as appropriate for patients with premenstrual anxiety (2C).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Some female patients with asthma experience exacerbation of asthma symptoms or decreased lung function before or during menstruation, which gradually improves after menstruation. This phenomenon is called PMA (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The incidence of PMA is approximately 19&#8211;40% (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Fluctuations in estrogen levels during ovulation and premenstrual period as well as changes in progesterone secreted during the luteal phase and its subsequent rapid decline may be involved in the pathogenesis of PMA (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics and difficulties of PMA</title><p>PMA is divided into premenstrual asthma and menstrual asthma. The former refers to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms during the luteal phase, which are relieved spontaneously after menstruation; the latter refers to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms on the first day of menstruation. The clinical manifestations are periodic exacerbations of cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea during the perimenstrual period (<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), which require the addition of bronchodilators and are accompanied with a decline in PEFR. The severity of PMA increases with age, and its duration prolongs until around menopause (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). PMA is a specific phenotype of asthma. Older patients and those with a higher body mass index are more likely to experience more severe and longer asthma with PMA and develop aspirin-sensitive asthma. Asthma medications are used more frequently in PMA patients, and such patients often experience dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, short menstrual cycle, and long bleeding time.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment, monitoring, and management of PMA</title><p>PMA patients need more active antiasthma treatment during menstrual cycle. The 2022 GINA suggests that PMA patients may potentially benefit from adding oral contraceptives and/or LTRAs to their conventional asthma therapy (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Several studies (<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>-<xref rid="r72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) have suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (including different combinations of estrogen and/or progesterone) has a therapeutic effect on PMA, which can improve lung function and reduce the number of acute exacerbations. For example, exogenous estradiol may relieve asthma symptoms (<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). It has been reported that intramuscular injection of high-dose progesterone in PMA patients&#8217; refractory to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy helps to relieve symptoms (<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). LTRAs can improve symptoms and PEFR variation rate by inhibiting inflammation (<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). However, the sample size of the above-mentioned studies is too small, and further verifications are required. In addition, the degree of PMA varies from person to person and is generally mild to moderate; however, some patients have very severe disease, even near-fatal asthma (NFA). Caution should be taken to prevent NFA in PMA patients who have experienced aggravated menstrual symptoms. The symptoms of asthma and the lung function during menstrual period should be recorded in the self-management plan of such patients (<xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).

The treatment and management of asthma exacerbation are approximately the same as those for the ordinary patients and should be started as early as possible (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="r90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). The arterial blood gas analysis of pregnant women indicates the presence of compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Acute exacerbation of asthma can lead to increased alkalosis, which can cause fetal hypoxia (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In contrast, acute respiratory acidosis may occur when PaCO<sub>2</sub> exceeds the normal level of 28&#8211;32 mmHg. Maternal acidosis can cause a loss of CO<sub>2</sub> pressure difference between maternal venous blood and fetal umbilical artery blood, resulting in decreased fetal excretion of CO<sub>2</sub>. During physical examination of patients with asthma in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the hemodynamic effects of an enlarged uterus in the supine position should be evaluated. Patients with moderate to severe asthma exacerbation should be monitored for vital signs, and obstetricians should also participate in the monitoring of fetal vital signs. Patients who frequently visit the emergency room, have been hospitalized, and that have required intubation or been admitted to ICU for severe asthma exacerbations should be considered the patients with high-risk or fatal asthma exacerbation. Prevention of maternal and fetal hypoxia and relaxation of the airway are most important in the management of severe asthma exacerbation during pregnancy. Pregnant women can be treated with oxygen inhalation, and the blood oxygen saturation level must be maintained above 95%. Nebulized salbutamol is recommended every 20 minutes during the first hour, and 500 &#181;g ipratropium bromide can be added to each nebulization. If this treatment fails to relieve the symptoms or the patients have moderate to severe acute exacerbation at the beginning, intravenous or OCS should be given. Intravenous theophylline does not further induce bronchodilation. If the patient has already taken oral theophylline, plasma theophylline concentration should be measured before intravenous administration of theophylline. Patients must be monitored and evaluated every hour in the emergency room for their response to treatment, and the decision on hospitalization or discharge home should be based on their response to treatment for the first four hours. In general, patients requiring further hospitalization are those who have little or no response to initial treatment in the emergency department, or those with life-threatening asthma exacerbations. Patients who require urgent intubation, whose condition worsens after therapy, and whose PaCO<sub>2 </sub>continues to increase are suggested to be admitted to the ICU for further management.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Treatment and management of asthma during delivery</title><p>Asthma exacerbation during delivery is uncommon, but it can pose serious threats to the parturient and fetus. It is currently considered that all asthma control drugs must be continued as usual during delivery. The vital signs of the parturient and fetus should be well monitored during delivery. Patients who take long-term oral glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisolone &#8805;7.5 mg/day for more than two weeks) should consider continuing glucocorticoids at delivery. It is recommended to use at least 50 mg hydrocortisone (intravenously or intramuscularly) every six hours from the start of the first stage of labor until six hours after delivery. Intraspinal anesthesia allows patients to maintain spontaneous breathing without endotracheal intubation and significantly reduces the risk of bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Hyperventilation during delivery may lead to bronchoconstriction, and SABAs should be used. If high doses of SABAs are administered during delivery, blood glucose of the fetus should be tested in the first 24 hours after birth. At present, there is no absolute indication for a termination of pregnancy in pregnant women with asthma. Whether or not to terminate pregnancy in emergency situations should be jointly decided by doctors of respiratory department, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and even intensive care medicine after multidisciplinary consultation. If the fetus has matured, early termination of pregnancy can be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment and management of asthma during lactation</title><p>The treatment and management of asthma during lactation should not only control asthma well, but should also reduce the entry of drugs into breast milk to reduce the impact of the drugs on infants. According to both domestic and international guidelines for asthma, there is no significant difference in therapeutic medication between asthma during lactation and other asthma patients, but it is necessary to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using certain drugs because of lactation.

Patients with asthma should be treated in accordance with the prevention and control guidelines for bronchial asthma. HRT is optional depending on the actual situation of menopause (2C).</p></sec><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Most women enter menopause after the age of 45 years and have different menstrual cycle lengths once menopause begins as a result of the changes in ovarian function and depletion of the follicular pool. Previous studies have shown that women in the menopausal transition, early postmenopausal period, and late postmenopausal period are at an increased risk of new-onset asthma. However, studies in this area are inconsistent. Some studies have shown that natural menopause does not lead to an increased risk of new-onset asthma in the overall population and in women with normal body mass index; natural menopause has an increased risk of new-onset asthma in overweight and obese women; and surgical menopause has an increased risk of new-onset asthma compared with premenopausal and natural menopause women (<xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics and difficulties of menopausal asthma</title><p>The unstable hormone levels of menopausal women lead to more obvious asthma symptoms. Restrictive pulmonary dysfunction caused by decreased lung function and osteoporosis increase the perception of asthma symptoms in menopausal patients (<xref rid="r92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). The incidence of nonallergic asthma may increase in menopausal women. Studies have shown that, compared with women who have asthma before menopause and healthy menopausal women, in women who have menopausal asthma, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are decreased, the proportion of neutrophils in sputum is increased, exhaled IL-6 levels are increased, and urinary leukotriene E-4 (LTE-4) levels are decreased (<xref rid="r93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment, monitoring and management of menopausal asthma</title><p>There is some controversy over the use of HRT for menopause (<xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Early studies have shown that HRT increases the risk of asthma, with the highest risk in women who use conjugated estrogens (<xref rid="r95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Such women also have a lower body mass index and do not smoke (<xref rid="r96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="r97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Subsequently, HRT after menopause has been linked to an increased probability of new-onset asthma (<xref rid="r94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Estrogen therapy alone and combined estrogen and progestin therapy increase the risk of new-onset asthma, while progestin therapy alone decreases the risk of new-onset asthma. In patients who stop HRT, the possibility of asthma disappearance is increased (<xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Another recent retrospective study on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 45 to 70 years who have had no asthma for five years or more has shown a decreased risk of new-onset asthma in women who have received either form of HRT compared with women who have not received HRT, with a further reduction in the risk of new-onset asthma in those who have used HRT for a longer period of time (<xref rid="r99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). The inconsistency of the above results is also related to the different efficacy of the compound medroxyprogesterone acetate used in the United States and other preparations used in Europe (<xref rid="r100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Thus, it is clear that estrogen, progesterone, and androgen interact in a complex manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of postmenopausal asthma and therapeutic management</title><sec><title>Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment</title><p>In clinical practice, for menopausal women with new-onset asthma or aggravated symptoms of preexisting asthma after menopause, it is important to note whether HRT has been performed, and discontinuation of HRT may be considered if necessary (2C). For elderly patients with asthma, final treatment recommendations should be carefully assessed and weighed against the risks and benefits when formulating treatment regimens, taking into account comorbidities that may exacerbate asthma or affect treatment outcome, as well as drug interactions, or potential adverse events (1C).</p></sec><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Epidemiological studies on menopause and asthma are scarce, and existing studies have yielded conflicting results. Most studies suggest that women are at an increased risk of developing asthma after menopause, which may be associated with the decrease of estrogen levels in the body (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,<xref rid="r101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). A survey that included nationwide databases in Korea indicated the highest prevalence of asthma among elderly women (<xref rid="r102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Airway inflammation in patients with postmenopausal asthma appears to differ from that in patients with early-onset asthma and is characterized by the poor response to anti-inflammatory therapy and more frequent acute asthma exacerbations (<xref rid="r103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). After menopause, women gradually enter the old age. Due to organ degeneration, physiological function and immune function decline, and many other diseases, asthma management is more complicated in old age.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics and difficulties of postmenopausal asthma</title><p>Compared with premenopausal asthma, new-onset asthma occurring during menopause and postmenopausal period has more severe clinical symptoms, relatively poor treatment response, fewer allergic symptoms, higher coincidence of chronic sinusitis, higher eosinophil levels, and more common acute exacerbations (<xref rid="r103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). Acute exacerbations tend to cause respiratory failure (<xref rid="r104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). Compared with asthma patients in other age groups, elderly patients with postmenopausal asthma have more comorbidities, often including cardiovascular diseases, endocrine diseases, neuropsychiatric diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Comorbidities may change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs for asthma, and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment, monitoring, and management of postmenopausal asthma</title><p>At present, the role of HRT in postmenopausal asthma remains controversial, with mixed results (<xref rid="r95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,<xref rid="r98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="r99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Therefore, in clinical practice, discontinuation of HRT should be considered if respiratory symptoms aggravate when HRT is prescribed.</p><p>The prescription of asthma medication and management of elderly patients with postmenopausal asthma must also be considered (<xref rid="r104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). In addition to complying with the management principles of adult asthma, special attention should be paid to the following characteristics: (I) due to many complications in the elderly patients, inhaled drugs are the optimal choice of prescription, and the potential risks of long-term use of inhaled high-dose ICS and &#946;2 receptor agonists on blood glucose and cardiovascular diseases should be paid attention to. (II) Most elderly people have problems with inspiratory flow rate and movement coordination, therefore, they may require individualized and careful guidance on the selection of inhalation devices and drug inhalation techniques.</p><p>The treatment principles of acute exacerbation of asthma in the elderly are consistent with those in adults, but elderly patients have more complications and rapid changes in their conditions, requiring careful and timely monitoring as well as assessment of response after treatment. In the treatment of acute exacerbation, special consideration should be given to the treatment of comorbidities and the impact of comorbidities on asthma.</p><p>The goals of senile asthma management are consistent with those of adult asthma, and special attention should be paid to the following points. Since elderly patients can have lower cognitive level and poorer learning ability, education needs to be strengthened in particular, and caregivers/family members should be educated together when necessary. It is also necessary to repeatedly educate and carefully guide patients to use inhaled drugs correctly and regularly. The use of multiple inhalers should be avoided to reduce inhalation errors. Patients should be educated as to use emergency relief medications in a timely manner during acute exacerbations and to enhance self-management.</p><p>The management model for postmenopausal asthma in the elderly requires comprehensive consideration of the complex comorbidities, impaired cognitive and behavioral abilities of elderly patients, and age-related psychosocial factors and drug interactions, as well as multidimensional evaluation and multidisciplinary intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of obese-asthma and therapeutic management</title><sec><title>Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment</title><p>Obese-asthma patients have poor treatment outcomes, and weight loss has many beneficial effects. Weight loss and weight control are priorities for asthma management in obese patients. Nonsurgical weight loss methods can effectively improve the outcomes of asthma. Weight loss through caloric restriction combined with exercises is the main intervention to improve the outcomes of asthma (1C).</p></sec><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Obesity is a complex chronic disease, and studies have shown that it can increase the severity of asthma (<xref rid="r104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>-<xref rid="r106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) evaluating the incidence of asthma in obese women &#8805;20 years of age in the United States have shown that the incidence of asthma is 7.9% in women with normal weight, 9.1% in overweight women, and 14.6% in obese women. The incidence of asthma is 6.1% in men with normal weight, 6.7% in overweight men, and 7.1% in obese men (<xref rid="r107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). A study of 4,619 subjects who were followed up for 25 years showed that the correlation between body mass index and female asthma events was statistically significant, and complicated metabolic syndrome could predict the occurrence of asthma events in women; however, it could not predict the occurrence of asthma events in men. Compared with complicated metabolic syndrome, body mass index can better predict the occurrence of asthma events in women (<xref rid="r108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). Dietary intake plays an important role in obesity and asthma. Tarazona-Meza found that better diet quality was associated with lower odds of asthma (<xref rid="r109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). According to Kim, the higher consumption of fish and seaweed and the high ratio of n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be associated with a lower prevalence of asthma in adult women (<xref rid="r110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). A cross-sectional study has suggested that dietary arachidonic acid is a promoter of allergic disease in women (<xref rid="r111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). In elderly women, a healthy diet is associated with fewer asthma symptoms, and, among women with asthma, healthy diet is linked to reduced uncontrolled asthma and metabolic-related multimorbidity (<xref rid="r112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). There is a complex association between asthma and obesity, especially in females. Vieira investigated the prevalence of atopy among healthy obese and nonobese women and found that the frequency of specific IgE in the obese group was almost three times higher than that in the nonobese group, confirming a direct relation between obesity and a T helper 2 cell immune response in women (<xref rid="r113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Body fat distribution affects the obesity-asthma relationship, and when stratifying by sex, the association between trunk-predominant adiposity (higher trunk/total fat and trunk/legs fat, or lower legs/total fat) and asthma has only been found in adult women (<xref rid="r114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). The root cause of sex differences in asthma risk may be related to different hormone levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics and difficulties of obese-asthma</title><p>In general, patients with obese-asthma have significant respiratory symptoms, are more severely ill, are not easily controlled, and respond poorly to ICS (<xref rid="r115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>-<xref rid="r117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). Residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) are reduced in patients with obese-asthma, manifesting as normal or restrictive pulmonary dysfunction (<xref rid="r118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Serum total IgE is normal or decreased, with no significant airway eosinophilic inflammation and low FeNO level (<xref rid="r119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>). Most patients suffer from obesity-related comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea and gastroesophageal disease (<xref rid="r120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). Some patients have history of nasal polyps. The response to glucocorticoid therapy is slow. Due to the limited effectiveness of inhaled glucocorticoids, traditional treatment methods do not work well for patients with obese-asthma, and the prognosis is worse than that of asthma patients with normal weight (<xref rid="r121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,<xref rid="r122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment, monitoring, and management of obese-asthma</title><p>Current asthma treatments are less effective in obese patients, and weight loss has many beneficial effects.

However, some studies have shown that weight loss surgery may not be effective for some patients (<xref rid="r125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). Nonsurgical weight loss can effectively improve the outcomes of asthma. Weight loss through caloric restriction combined with exercises is the main intervention to improve the outcomes of asthma. Metformin, a drug for diabetes with a weight-loss effect (<xref rid="r126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,<xref rid="r127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>), may facilitate asthma control because of its potential anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects, or because of its improvement of insulin resistance (<xref rid="r128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Obese patients with refractory asthma are hormone-insensitive and have systemic inflammation.

Common causes of bronchial asthma are exposure to allergens, various physicochemical irritants, or upper respiratory tract infections (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The incidence, severity, exacerbation, hospitalization, and mortality of asthma are generally higher in women than in men (<xref rid="r130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). In women, asthma symptoms fluctuate due to fluctuation in sex hormone levels at different stages. About 30% to 40% of women experience worsening symptoms during menstruation, and PMA is associated with emergency department visits, hospitalization, ICU admission for endotracheal intubation, and even fatal events (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Currently, there is still lack of multicenter studies on the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in women, and treatment still follows the guidelines and strategies for asthma prevention and treatment. For PMA and acute exacerbation of asthma during pregnancy, please refer to this expert consensus; for asthma during other periods, please refer to the Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Bronchial Asthma (<xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).</p><p>Severe asthma refers to asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with maximal optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. A previous study reported that almost two-thirds of patients with severe asthma were female (<xref rid="r131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). A global registry study of severe asthma showed that 59.3% of women had severe asthma (<xref rid="r132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Italian network data of severe asthma showed that the disease was characterized by late onset, more complications, and poor control (<xref rid="r133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). Therefore, the incidence of severe asthma in women is high. The pathogenesis of severe asthma in women is not sufficiently clear, and asthma that occurs after menopause is usually a non-type 2 inflammatory asthma (<xref rid="r134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>). There are not many studies on its treatment. A study of a biological agent in the treatment of patients with severe asthma has shown that sex is not a determinant of response to the biological agent therapy. However, elderly women treated with biological agents have significantly higher improvement in pulmonary function than men of the same age group. Presently, the principle of treatment for severe asthma in women continues to be individualized treatment according to the guidelines.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The prevalence, incidence, and severity of asthma vary by sex and may be related to genetic/epigenetic factors, sex hormones, socio-environmental factors, and response to treatment. In addition, the complex heterogeneity of asthma makes it difficult for medical staff to fully understand the specific impact of sex differences on the diagnosis and management of asthma. The increased incidence, severity, control level, and comorbidities of asthma are all related to the hormone levels and endocrine balance in human body. There have been many large cohorts and basic studies at the animal and cell level that have explored the pathogenesis of female asthma, and the diagnosis, treatment, and management specifications at different physiological stages. However, there is still a lack of high-quality studies on the effects of sex hormones, physiological, and endocrine characteristics at different stages of the female life cycle on the pathogenesis and progression of asthma and the response to different treatments. It remains to be studied whether there are sex differences in the efficacy of type 2 and non-type 2 inflammatory asthma according to the current inflammatory pathway, and whether there are sex differences in the susceptibility of asthma patients to SARS-CoV-2. This unmet need suggests further clinical and epidemiological research is required to clarify the pathogenesis of asthma caused by the changes in sex hormones or the use of exogenous hormone therapy, as well as the impact on asthma treatment response. In addition, as more biologics are approved for the treatment of asthma, we must further clarify their differences in the efficacy by sex and age. These studies will strengthen our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma and provide individualized treatment and management plans for different populations at all stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><p>The article&#8217;s supplementary files as</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="anchor" id="su1" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jtd-16-01-773-prf.pdf" id="d66e1737" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/jtd-23-1069</object-id></media><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jtd-16-01-773-coif.pdf" id="d66e1740" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/jtd-23-1069</object-id></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank LetPub (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.letpub.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.letpub.com</ext-link>) for linguistic assistance and pre-submission expert review.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Funding:</italic> This work was supported by <funding-source rid="sp1">National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source> (<award-id rid="sp1">Nos. 82161138020 and U1801286</award-id>), <funding-source rid="sp2">Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou</funding-source> (<award-id rid="sp2">No. 202102010011</award-id>), and <funding-source rid="sp3">Zhongnanshan Medical Foundation of Guangdong Province</funding-source> (<award-id rid="sp3">Nos.
