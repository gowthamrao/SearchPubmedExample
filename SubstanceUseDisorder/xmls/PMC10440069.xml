Data describing the patient burden of OD, as compared with SLE without OD, are limited. <bold>Objective:</bold> To develop a comprehensive conceptual model describing the burden experienced by patients living with SLE-associated OD. <bold>Methods:</bold> There were three phases to this qualitative study. First, a targeted literature review was conducted to inform a draft conceptual model. Second, key opinion leaders (KOLs) were interviewed to assess the draft conceptual model and help shape patient interview materials. Third, patients of different demographic backgrounds from across the United States were interviewed individually to gather their perspectives on living with SLE-associated OD. Data from concept elicitation interviews with KOLs and patients were coded and analyzed using NVivo software to identify the key concepts of the overall patient burden of SLE-associated OD. Findings from the KOL and patient interviews were used to finalize the conceptual model. <bold>Results:</bold> KOLs highlighted that SLE-associated OD carried a higher rate of mortality than SLE alone. Participants with SLE-associated OD (n&#8201;=&#8201;40) experienced detrimental impacts across 4 areas of their lives: physical, cognitive, psychosocial functioning, and economic and work-related well-being. Physical impacts were described by all participants, often affecting their ability to perform everyday tasks. Many also described deterioration of cognitive functioning. Almost all participants experienced emotional impacts and challenges to their relationships and social lives resulting from living with SLE-associated OD. Additionally, SLE-associated OD imposed an economic burden including increased healthcare costs. SLE-associated OD had a more severe and debilitating impact on all aspects of the patient&#8217;s quality of life than SLE prior to OD development, including further limitations in activities of daily living after the development of OD. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Study findings guided the development of a comprehensive conceptual model that fully represents the patient experience of living with SLE-associated OD, highlighting the additional burden of OD when compared with SLE alone.
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> The conceptual model will inform improvements in disease management, which may result in better patient outcomes and aid development of clinical outcome assessments of disease burden.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>concept elicitation</kwd><kwd>systemic lupus erythematosus</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>organ damage</kwd><kwd>conceptual model</kwd><kwd>burden of disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by GSK (GSK Study 209754).

All abstracts were screened and relevant articles selected for full-text review (<bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>).

Potential participants were identified from an existing list of individuals who had previously volunteered to take part in this type of research, recruiter databases, physician referrals, patient support groups, and social media (eg, Facebook) in the United States (US). Patients were eligible to take part if they were at least 18 years of age; fluent in spoken and written US English; lived in the US; had confirmed diagnoses of long-term OD associated with SLE; and had evidence of damage in at least 1 organ system (cardiovascular, dermatological, diabetes, gastrointestinal, malignancy, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, ocular, peripheral vascular, premature gonadal failure, pulmonary, and renal) as defined by the SDI.<xref rid="ref-236499" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Patients&#8217; SLE diagnosis was confirmed by (1) physicians completing the confirmation form, (2) patients providing a screenshot or printout of their diagnosis from a patient portal or medical record, or (3) patients providing a photo of their current medications for the treatment of SLE.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they were unable to independently participate in a 60- to 75-minute telephone interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Concept Elicitation Interview Procedures</title><p>Concept elicitation is a qualitative research method that allows the patient experience to be explored in depth, typically via one-on-one interviews or focus groups.

Emergent themes were discussed and reviewed by the wider research team to provide feedback on the conceptual model and insights for developing the patient interview materials.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Interviews and Analysis</title><p>Patient interviews lasted 60 to 75 minutes and explored their experiences of living with SLE-associated OD. Participants were asked questions regarding the physical, emotional, social, and economic impact of SLE-associated OD on their quality of life and their experiences of treatment of SLE. Open-ended questions were followed by probing questions to clarify and assist interpretation of emerging concepts.</p><p>Similarly to the KOL interviews, all interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim; all transcripts were quality checked by the research team for accuracy and analyzed using thematic analysis as described above.</p><p>The first 8 patient transcripts were each coded by 2 researchers to determine and refine the initial coding structure and ensure coding consistency. A third researcher participated in the review of coding (for consensus on coding and any new codes added) after the first 4 interviews were coded, and again when the next 4 had been coded. The 3 researchers split coding of the remaining 32 interviews, meeting when there were questions or clarification required. As additional patient interviews were coded and new themes or concepts arose, the coding schema was updated and refined to create a list of common themes that were eventually incorporated into the conceptual model. This process continued until no new concepts were identified. Saturation of concepts was achieved early in the data collection process, within the first 16 interviews; however, interviews continued to gain further valuable information including ensuring representation of each area of SLE-associated OD and representation of patients with a single area of OD, 2 areas of OD, and multiple areas of OD (&#8805;3).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of Data and Material</title><p>Anonymized individual participant data and study documents can be requested for further research from https://www.gsk-studyregister.com/en/</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Literature Review and Draft Conceptual Model</title><p>A total of 71 articles were retrieved for full-text review, including 2 articles describing existing conceptual models for SLE.<xref rid="ref-236507" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> Based on the literature review findings, to present a complete picture of the SLE-associated OD, the initial version of the conceptual model was compiled to: (1) include the overall impact of SLE and disease and economic impacts of SLE-associated OD; (2) show the relationships between SLE/OD and different treatments; and (3) incorporate clinical outcomes and treatment targets. Treatments and treatment targets are integrated parts of the disease model that inform better treatment decisions. This initial conceptual model was then reviewed by the KOLs.</p></sec><sec><title>KOL Interviews</title><p>Six KOLs (5 clinicians and 1 patient advocacy leader [diagnosed with SLE in 1990]) were interviewed; 3 were from Europe, 2 from North America, and 1 from South America. Among the clinicians, 3 were rheumatology specialists, 1 was a rheumatologist/nephrologist, and 1 specialized in internal medicine. Their clinical experience of treating patients with SLE ranged from 11 to 21 years or more.</p><p>The KOLs reported that the draft model broadly captured the patient experience of SLE-associated OD; however, they offered suggestions to clarify concepts captured by the model. First, they emphasized the need to highlight that the impacts of SLE are manageable and reversible, while impacts of OD are irreversible and permanent (&#8220;&#8230; the point of no return means that from this [point on] it&#8217;s irreversible and it causes more damage or it will affect more organ systems&#8221; [ID 03, rheumatologist]). Next, they indicated that the conceptual model should clearly demonstrate that patients with SLE-associated OD experience more complications and impacts of disease (eg, increased risk and impact of comorbidities, psychological/cognitive damage, infertility, permanent work disability), compared with patients without SLE-associated OD. Additional recommendations are included in the supplementary information (<bold>Table S2</bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Interviews</title><p>Forty individuals with SLE-associated OD participated in the interviews, the majority of whom were female (n = 38; 95%); the mean age was 43.4 years (<bold><xref rid="attachment-175904" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Over half of patients were white (n = 22; 55%), and a fifth of patients were of Black African ancestry (n = 8; 20%). Overall, 13 (32.5%) patients had received their SLE diagnosis at least 10 years prior. Many participants reported being diagnosed with SLE-associated OD in more than 1 area (n = 31; 77.5%). The most prevalent areas of OD were dermatological (n = 24; 60%), renal (n = 22; 55%), musculoskeletal (n = 20; 50%), and pulmonary (n = 18; 45%).

Notably, many participants (n = 31; 77.5%) shared that they were no longer working because of their SLE-associated OD. For those still working, the symptoms they experience played a role in lost productivity and absenteeism, distracting them or necessitating time off if they were not feeling well.

Consideration of data from a sample of patients with damage across various organ systems, different levels of damage, and significant variation in the time since diagnosis ensured the model reflected the experiences of a broad range of patients.</p><p>The conceptual model displays the impacts of SLE-associated OD on 4 distinct areas of patients&#8217; lives: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, and economic and work-related well-being. Other studies have also shown that increased OD negatively impacts patients&#8217; emotional, physical, and social functions, as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36.<xref rid="ref-236495" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,14</sup></xref> Physical impacts were especially devastating to patients and overlapped with impacts in all other areas of patients&#8217; lives. For example, patients shared how physical symptoms impacted their ability to work, while others commented that their social lives and relationships had been negatively affected by the physical aspects of their condition. Nearly all patients reported a loss of vitality that overlapped with more specific impacts on their everyday life, such as fatigue. About three-fourths of patients described problems with cognitive functioning, which were closely tied to emotional and work-related impacts. All patients reported concerns about the economic consequences of SLE-associated OD, including impacts on employment and ability to work, and increased medical costs.</p><p>A key finding of this study was that the impacts and patient burden of OD are far greater than those associated with SLE prior to OD development. Many patients experienced more severe symptoms and impacts including physical impairment, significant changes in their relationships, employment status, and feelings of anxiety and depression. As one patient commented, &#8220;&#8230; it just changes everything in your life&#8230;&#8221; This notable increase in burden, which is also supported by previous studies,<xref rid="ref-236500" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14,28</sup></xref> highlights the permanent and irreversible nature of SLE-associated OD and emphasizes the importance of slowing OD progression. This is consistent with the recent inclusion of prevention of OD as a treatment goal in clinical guidelines and further emphasizes the value of this treatment goal for patients living with SLE-associated OD.<xref rid="ref-236516" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Key treatment goals identified by the patients in this study were to reduce disease activity, manage symptoms, reduce medication use, and improve HRQoL.</p><p>Understanding the patient experience of a disease is essential for improving clinical practice and research. By focusing on the patient experience of SLE-associated OD, this study built upon existing conceptual models depicting the burden of SLE where OD was not the focus<xref rid="ref-236507" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> and expanded our understanding of how different the experience and impacts of OD are (including risk factors for OD, treatment management, and experiences). Although the themes may not be unique to OD compared with patients with SLE, KOLs highlighted that patients with SLE-associated OD had a higher rate of mortality, and patients reported experiencing further limitations in ADLs and lower HRQoL after the development of OD.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the lack of a control group with SLE and no OD. Participants retrospectively compared their experiences before and after the onset of SLE-associated OD and reported more severe impacts across more areas of functioning and well-being since incurring OD. However, given the impacts on functioning and well-being are similar to those reported by patients with SLE and no OD, a control group would allow for further distinction in the severity of impacts. In addition, SLE is known to disproportionately affect non-white individuals who experience a more rapid accumulation of damage,<xref rid="ref-236517" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> so the extent to which these findings can be generalized to all SLE patients might be limited as more than half of patients were white. Furthermore, most patients were from the Southeast region of the US, and the results may reflect more of their experience than the experience of those from other regions of the US. In future studies, it would also be interesting to compare the experiences of patients with SLE and newly diagnosed OD and those with longer-term OD (ie, &gt;10 years), and to understand the experiences of patients with SLE and OD with and without health insurance.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This comprehensive conceptual model represents the patient experience of living with SLE-associated OD, highlighting the additional burden of OD when compared with SLE alone. The model will aid in the development of clinical outcome assessments (eg, patient-reported outcome instruments) of disease burden and will inform future improvement in disease management and therefore outcomes of these patients.</p><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="contrib"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the conception and design of the study and data analysis or interpretation.
