Health disparities occur when plausibly avoidable health differences are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations. Highlighting health disparities, their sources, and consequences in chronic liver disease is fundamental to improving liver health outcomes. There have been large increases in alcohol use disorder in women, racial and ethnic minorities, and those experiencing poverty in the context of poor access to alcohol treatment, leading to increasing rates of alcohol&#8208;associated liver diseases. Rising rates of NAFLD and associated fibrosis have been observed in Hispanic persons, women aged &gt;&#8201;50, and individuals experiencing food insecurity. Access to viral hepatitis screening and linkage to treatment are suboptimal for racial and ethnic minorities and individuals who are uninsured or underinsured, resulting in greater liver&#8208;related mortality and later&#8208;stage diagnoses of HCC. Data from more diverse cohorts on autoimmune and cholestatic liver diseases are lacking, supporting the need to study the contemporary epidemiology of these disorders in greater detail. Herein, we review the existing literature on racial and ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in chronic liver diseases using a social determinants of health framework to better understand how social and structural factors cause health disparities and affect chronic liver disease outcomes. We also propose potential solutions to eliminate disparities, outlining health&#8208;policy, health&#8208;system, community, and individual solutions to promote equity and improve health outcomes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Health disparities occur when plausibly avoidable health differences are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These disparities occur in the context of structural and social determinants of health (SSDOH) or the social policies, laws, and structures that govern access to education, employment, housing, and health care.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These macrolevel system and social forces can together create and reinforce inequity in living conditions and unmet social needs, contributing to disease risk factors and ultimately poor outcomes in marginalized groups (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Specifically, structural racism, or the legacy of systematic discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the legal system, has led to profound differences in health care access and health outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities and is at the root of many observed health inequities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Categories of race and ethnicity are socially constructed and have changed over time and place.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, this categorization has consequences on health outcomes.

In a population&#8208;based study of 457,677 adults, people who did not graduate from high school or who had incomes &lt; $25,000 a year had the lowest prevalence of binge drinking, with rates of 13.7% and 16.2%, respectively.

In a recent analysis of Explorys Inc. data which aggregates electronic health records from multiple US health systems, among 8,445,720 patients, Black patients (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.46&#8211;2.81) and women (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08&#8211;1&#8208;20) were found to be more likely than White patients and men, respectively, to be diagnosed with alcohol&#8208;associated hepatitis.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> While this study provided a snapshot of a large population, the analysis did not adjust for other demographic, clinical, or socioeconomic variables; and other racial and ethnic groups were not included.</p><p>The adverse effects of alcohol consumption uniquely burden minority communities. Explanations for higher ALD in Hispanic and Black populations compared to White populations include SSDOH. Specifically, denser alcohol outlet densities and closer proximity to alcohol outlets as a result of the multigenerational effects of zoning and redlining, neighborhood disinvestment, and reduced access to health care contribute to higher disease burden.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition, the patatin&#8208;like phospholipase domain&#8208;containing&#8208;3 (PNPLA3) gene has been determined by genome&#8208;wide association studies to be associated with hepatic fat content and hepatocyte damage<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and has been strongly associated with ALD.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This allele is more common in Hispanic persons, is thought to contribute to higher rates of NAFLD, and may in part explain the higher prevalence of ALD.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Women have been demonstrated to be more susceptible to liver disease with less alcohol consumption in the setting of a smaller volume of distribution, reduced gastric alcohol dehydrogenase compared to men, and sex differences in hepatic alcohol metabolism.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In addition, targeted alcohol advertising in television, print, and social media conflating the women's liberation movement with heavy drinking alongside male peers and the &#8220;wine mom&#8221; persona has contributed to normalizing heavy drinking among women.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This greater biological susceptibility coupled with increases in alcohol consumption as reflected in these cultural trends have likely contributed to rising rates of ALD in women. In an NHANES study from 2015 to 2016, the prevalence of ALD among those with Stage 2 or greater fibrosis more than doubled in women, from 0.5% to 1.3%.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In a study of a privately insured population the prevalence of alcohol&#8208;associated cirrhosis increased by 50% from 2009 to 2015 among women compared to only a 30% increase in men.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Finally, hospital admissions for alcohol&#8208;associated hepatitis have dramatically increased for women; among three community hospitals in California, there was a 125% increase in women hospitalized for severe acute alcohol&#8208;associated hepatitis during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Access to care</title><p>Studies have identified racial and ethnic disparities in accessing specialty alcohol and substance use disorder treatment services.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In an analysis from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2015 to 2017 of 12,070 participants, access to alcohol and substance use treatment between insured Black and White participants was similar (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65&#8211;1.16), but a disparity between insured Hispanic and White participants (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53&#8211;0.97) was seen, suggesting that insurance status may explain some of the racial and ethnic disparities in access to such care. However, in a cohort of 35,682 veterans with cirrhosis and alcohol use disorder (AUD) receiving Veterans Health Administration care, in which access to care is not dependent on insurance status, only 14% received pharmacotherapy and behavioral AUD treatment,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> highlighting that provider or system barriers may contribute to lack of access. Importantly, in socially disadvantaged populations, including those of Black race, being unsheltered and having a diagnosis of HCV, an opioid use disorder, a high AUD identification test score, substance use disorders, and a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder were all associated with receiving behavioral therapy or pharmacotherapy.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>Data suggest that there are disparities in access to alcohol and substance use treatment for women.

In addition, women are more likely to have partners, friends, and family members who support their substance use and less likely to receive mandated treatment through employers or the criminal justice system. They also may face greater financial burdens associated with seeking treatment and need for child care.

While much of our understanding of existing disparities comes from large population&#8208;based data sets (i.e., UNOS, NIS, NHANES), these cohorts are inherently limited for several reasons. For example, when evaluating transplant access and outcomes, data sources such as the UNOS lack detailed socioeconomic information about income, education, social support, and health behaviors. Also, while many data sets are beginning to include information about neighborhood quality and deprivation, these factors are not accounted for in most disparities analyses. Such data also do not reflect individual&#8208;level determinants, which may be unique from the built environment.</p><p>Additionally, the NIS and NHANES lack reliable methods for diagnosing liver disease and assessing severity; the NIS contains no laboratory data to assess liver disease severity, and the NHANES has relied on the use of noninvasive risk scores (i.e., aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio score or Fibrosis&#8208;4 index) to identify liver fibrosis (until 2017 when transient elastography data became available), which may lead to misclassification bias. As transient elastography becomes more widespread, improved measurements of steatosis and fibrosis will help to better characterize the relationship between race, gender, socioeconomic factors, and liver health outcomes in these larger cohorts. Further, increasing use of electronic health record data sets will result in the collection of more granular, high&#8208;quality data.</p><p>Another major limitation we observed was the lack of stratification by race or ethnicity in studies examining liver outcomes. In one of the largest retrospective analyses of US trends in HCC&#8208;related and cirrhosis&#8208;related mortality after DAA treatment of HCV, stratification by race and ethnicity was notably missing.<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> Other examples include the underrepresentation of Black persons in prevalence studies of autoimmune/cholestatic liver diseases and lack of inclusion of Black and Hispanic populations in NAFLD therapeutic clinical trials, despite the high disease burden of NAFLD among Hispanic populations.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref></p><p>Finally, we echo recent calls within the gastroenterology community for greater scrutiny of the use of broad racial and ethnic categories in research studies<xref rid="R154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref> because these categories do not account for the high degree of ancestral heterogeneity and differences in cultural practices within racial and ethnic groups. For example, in our review of community&#8208;based studies of HBV, we found marked ethnic differences in linkage to care, liver disease severity, and timely HCC diagnosis among Asian persons. These groups may have different disease risks and socioeconomic conditions based on their country of origin that are not captured well in the current literature.

While several state Medicaid programs have loosened their treatment restrictions for HCV as global elimination efforts have intensified, many states continue to restrict access to HCV treatment based on fibrosis stage or history of recent drug use.<xref rid="R160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref> Indeed, Medicaid expansion and leniency of HCV coverage were recently shown to improve cirrhosis mortality.<xref rid="R161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref> These data highlight the importance of removing payer restrictions and implementing more widespread health insurance at the state and federal levels to expand access to lifesaving therapies and improve liver&#8208;related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Health systems solutions</title><p>Unmet social needs are a barrier to care for racial and ethnic minorities and are being increasingly targeted by health systems for intervention.<xref rid="R162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref> Social needs screening and referral should be performed in our nontransplant populations to identify populations in need of social work referral early in their disease course so that they might be able to better prioritize their liver health. Similarly, patients who live in communities and neighborhoods that put them at risk for poor liver disease outcomes should be identified early, with closer monitoring by providers as indicated, care navigation programs, and social work referrals.</p><p>The above measures assume that patients enter into hepatology care early in their disease course. However, racial and ethnic minorities have been shown to be waitlisted with higher MELD scores and to have larger HCC tumors at presentation, suggesting later access in their disease course to the health care system.<xref rid="R149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,<xref rid="R163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref> Wide dissemination of clear clinical care pathways, such as the one designed for NAFLD, to primary care providers can help to identify patients earlier in their disease course.<xref rid="R164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref> Partnerships with the National Hispanic Medical Association and other community organizations could be developed to disseminate culturally tailored clinical care pathways to minority groups. Care pathways should include descriptions of high&#8208;risk and minority populations.</p><p>While early diagnosis of CLD is important, some patients will still need specialty liver disease care. Telehealth has been successful at improving access to care and survival for rural populations with CLD and reducing evaluation time for listing on the LT waitlist.<xref rid="R165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>,<xref rid="R166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref> However, telehealth may further exacerbate health disparities due to language barriers,<xref rid="R167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>,<xref rid="R168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref> inequities in access to internet services,<xref rid="R169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref> or challenges faced in using telemedicine platforms.<xref rid="R170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref> Strategies to mitigate digital disparities include providing telemedicine education to patients, ensuring language and interpreter access in telehealth platforms, and designing user&#8208;friendly patient portals.</p><p>To promote equitable access to LT, culturally tailored navigation programs that address literacy, distrust, and social needs, such as the African American Transplant Access Program and the Hispanic Transplant Program at Northwestern, are needed.<xref rid="R171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref> Additionally, transplant equity working groups through UNOS or the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) should be formed to develop health equity metrics that could be made publicly available to encourage program initiatives that combat liver health disparities.</p><p>Implementation of quality improvement (QI) measures in cirrhosis care is another potential strategy to help health systems mitigate existing health disparities. QI initiatives in patients with cirrhosis have been shown to reduce hospital readmissions<xref rid="R172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref> and increase HCC surveillance,<xref rid="R173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref> though the impact on reducing disparities has not been explored. The AASLD has developed a standard set of QI metrics, including both process&#8208;based measures and patient&#8208;reported outcomes, for cirrhosis and HCC,<xref rid="R174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref> which have been demonstrated to improve mortality.<xref rid="R177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref> Assessment of differences in these metrics by gender and race and ethnicity may identify groups that would benefit the most from QI interventions. Application of a QI framework offers a solutions&#8208;based approach to potentially reduce liver disease disparities by targeting modifiable aspects of care delivery and then refining the approach over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Community&#8208;level solutions</title><p>In addition to health policy&#8211;level and health systems&#8211;level solutions, interventions at the community level may be effective in mitigating disparities and improving health outcomes in minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. One example of this is implementation of community&#8208;based screening programs for viral hepatitis in high&#8208;risk groups, such as people who experience homelessness. The University of California San Francisco's DeLIVER Care Van, a mobile unit that provides HCV testing and treatment to PWID or who experience homelessness in San Francisco, is an example of a grassroots effort to deliver services to underserved communities and meet patients where they are.<xref rid="R178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref> The Cherokee Nation Hepatitis C Virus Elimination Program is another example of a community&#8208;based, multilevel intervention that has been effective at improving the cascade of care, including screening, linkage to care, treatment, and cure.<xref rid="R179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref> Expansion of treatment programs for alcohol and substance use, including non&#8208;faith&#8208;based programs, family&#8208;based AUD counseling and education, and tailored support groups for young women, are potential community&#8208;level solutions to address the rising tide of AUD in the United States.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify significant disparities in CLD burden, access to care, and outcomes in the United States, with racial and ethnic minorities, women, and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals being disproportionately impacted. Rising rates of ALD and NAFLD and suboptimal viral hepatitis screening and treatment strategies among those at greatest risk are contributing to these disparities. Given that our understanding of liver&#8208;related disparities largely comes from population&#8208;based retrospective cohorts, the development of prospectively maintained cohorts with granular neighborhood and individual social determinant and liver disease characteristics is needed to examine the root causes of liver health disparities. Ultimately, however, we must move beyond simply reporting disparities to implementing multilevel health equity solutions that acknowledge the relationship between the SSODH and health care disparities.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data</italic>: Ani Kardashian, Marina Serper, Norah Terrault, Lauren D.
