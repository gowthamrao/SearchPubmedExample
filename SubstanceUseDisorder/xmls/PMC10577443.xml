Males consistently exhibited higher rates than females, with smoking as a key risk factor. Central Asia reported the highest rates, and South Asia the lowest. The incidence rose with age, peaking in those aged 70~74. The disease burden increased in all age groups, particularly in populations aged 55 and above, representing 84.41% of total cases in 2019, up from 79.01% in 1990.

Regarding histological classifications, exocrine tumors account for 95% of pancreatic cancer, predominantly presenting as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The residual fraction primarily includes endocrine pancreatic cancer, which progress more slowly and usually with favorable prognosis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Pancreatic cancer is extremely invasive. Owing to the lack of distinct clinical symptoms and early-stage diagnostic tools, many patients are only diagnosed during the advanced stages of the disease, which leads to a bleak prognosis and increased mortality. The cumulative five-year survival rate is roughly around 10% (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although multidisciplinary care and adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the prognosis, early surgical resection remains the only chance for cure (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Studies have shown that the age-standardized mortality rates are highest in high-income areas, such as North America and Western Europe (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In Asia, the pancreatic cancer situation has unique aspects, although its burden is generally lower contrasted with affluent Western nations, the growth rate in Asia is accelerating (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Lifestyle, dietary habits, and genetic factors might be associated with the epidemiological features of pancreatic cancer. Firstly, smoking stands as one of the most consequential risk contributors to pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Secondly, a heightened body mass index (BMI) correlates with a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thirdly, elevated fasting glucose levels, especially in type 2 diabetes, is a significant risk determinant for pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, factors such as alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer, which may exacerbate its burden in Asia (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the population of Asia accounts for nearly 60% of the global population. With the aging population, the cases of pancreatic cancer is expected to increase (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Despite this, comprehensive research on the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer in Asia remains scarce. Therefore, an in-depth examination of the epidemiological landscape of pancreatic cancer across Asia, especially focusing on the middle-aged and elderly high-risk populations is necessary. This analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of pancreatic cancer, thereby providing a scientific basis for its effective prevention and control strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Method</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Data source</title><p>In our investigation, we specifically focused on the burden of pancreatic cancer across 52 Asian countries. The data was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To accurately appraise the burden of pancreatic cancer in Asia, we retrieved data specific to this region from the GBD 2019 study (accessible via <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/" ext-link-type="uri">https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/</ext-link>). The data encompassed the incidence, mortality, and DALY associated with pancreatic cancer, coupled with the death toll and DALY related to diverse risk factors spanning from 1990 to 2019. Data were divided by sex, age, and regional location and then aggregated by age across consecutive five-year intervals.</p><p>Furthermore, we garnered age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), mortality rates (ASMR), DALY rates (ASDR), and annual average rates of change in ASDR for the six principal gastrointestinal cancers from 1990 to 2019. This group of cancers encompasses pancreatic, colorectal, liver, esophageal, gastric, as well as gallbladder and biliary tract cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>Risk factors</title><p>In our study, we incorporated three recognized risk factors for pancreatic cancer - high body mass index (BMI), high fasting plasma glucose, and smoking. We employed a comparative risk evaluation framework to gauge the proportion of deaths and DALYs attributable to these identified risk factors (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><label>2.3</label><title>Estimated annual percentage change</title><p>For analyzing the trend of pancreatic cancer incidence, we applied ASIR, ASMR, AMDR, and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

This analysis facilitates the exploration of underlying physiological, social, historical, and environmental factors. Period effects epitomize the fluctuations in incidence over time, while cohort effects relate to changes within specific groups sharing the same birth year. Two pivotal parameters within APC models are the net and local drifts. The net drift highlights the annual percentage alteration in incidence with the passage of time, while local drifts illustrate the yearly percentage changes in incidence within distinct age groups over the same period (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><label>2.5</label><title>Decomposition</title><p>Decomposition analysis was employed in our study to estimate the contribution of each factor to the overall incidence of pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

Concurrently, the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer rose from 2.0 per 100,000 people (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.2) to 5.5 per 100,000 people (95% CI, 4.9 to 6.0) from 1990 to 2019. Moreover, in this span, the incidence persistently showed a higher trend in males compared to females. In 2019, male cases amounted to 138,552.4 (95% UI, 121,442.8 to 156,604.2), whereas female cases numbered 111,408.96 (95% UI, 96,616.4 to 125,983.5). The incidence rate for 2019 was 6.0 per 100,000 for males (95% CI, 5.2 to 6.8) and 5.0 per 100,000 for females (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.6).

Moreover, among the risk factors for pancreatic cancer in Asia, smoking was associated with the highest deaths, accounting for 48,434.5 deaths (95% UI, 40,472.4 to 56,857.7). This was followed by high fasting glucose, which was related to 19,476.7 deaths (95% UI, 4,434.7 to 42,833.9), and high body mass index, which was associated with 9,472.7 deaths (95% UI, 3,059.4 to 19,776.4). Significantly, the number of pancreatic cancer deaths attributable to smoking was greater in males compared to females, with 38,383.6 versus 10,050.9, respectively. In contrast, deaths associated with high body mass index were higher in females than in males, with counts of 5,125.9 and 4,346.8, respectively.

Notwithstanding, research concerning pancreatic cancer remains concentrated in a few developed Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. This research combines the data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 and provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of pancreatic cancer in 52 countries in Asia.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2019, the incidence, mortality, and DALY rates for pancreatic cancer increased significantly in Asia, irrespective of age and sex adjustments. These results signify a rising burden of pancreatic cancer in the past thirty years. Notably, the disease burden was consistently higher in males compared to females during the study period, with an earlier age of onset observed in male. On a global scale, the incidence of pancreatic cancer typically presents a slight male predominance, particularly in individuals under the age of 75 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This gender disparity may be attributed to factors such as smoking and physiological differences. Assessing various risk factors, we discovered that the burden of pancreatic cancer attributable to smoking was considerably higher in male than in female. Conversely, the burden ascribed to high BMI and high fasting blood glucose was comparable between male and female. This suggests that while smoking plays a more significant role in male, the impact of high BMI and high fasting blood glucose is consistent in both genders. Existing studies have confirmed that the risk of pancreatic cancer in smokers is twice that of non-smokers (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Individuals in the BMI range of 25 to 30 and 30 to 35 kg/m2 showed a heightened risk of pancreatic cancer by 13% and 19% respectively, when contrasted with those with normal BMIs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Upon examination of the three risk factors, smoking emerged as the predominant factor contributing to the increased burden of pancreatic cancer in Asia. We discerned a linear relationship between smoking prevalence and pancreatic cancer burden, with regions of higher smoking prevalence typically exhibiting a greater burden. In Asian, the rate of smoking in male markedly surpasses the female. Research has verified that smoking contribute to the higher risk of diabetes by 44%, as it triggers insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion, and amplifies the incidence of abdominal obesity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Nonetheless, with the passage of time, female smoking rates are gradually rising, which potentially precipitate a significant escalation in the female-specific burden of pancreatic cancer in the future. Implementing strategies to curtail smoking rates in countries with high smoking prevalence, such as Armenia and Georgia, will reduce the burden of pancreatic cancer. Due to a greater percentage of body fat in Asian population compared to Western ones, the World Health Organization advocates for a lower threshold for obesity in these populations (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). A Korean study, which defined obesity as BMI &#8805; 25 kg/m2, showed that obese individuals had a slightly increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but this risk was significantly lower than those reported in the West (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Research indicates a strong correlation between obesity and diabetes and economic advancement, with higher prevalence of both conditions in more developed regions. With the poverty alleviation in China and other Asian countries, the rates of obesity and diabetes also continue to rise, which may lead to higher prevalence of pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>The incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer have surged notably in a majority of Asian countries. Nevertheless, stark disparities in incidence rates exist in different countries and regions. The ASIR, for instance, exhibited a 6.65-fold difference at its extremes (comparing Palau at 11.43 and Papua New Guinea at 1.72). EAPC analysis revealed that the average annual growth rates of the ASIR in Asia was 1.73%. Countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam witnessed the most rapid rise of these rates. In contrast, Thailand and South Korea demonstrated relative stability in their ASIR throughout the study period, with Samoa being the only country exhibiting a declining trend. Moreover, most Asian countries continue to see an upward trajectory in ASMR and ASDR. However, countries including Singapore, Japan, and South Korea show a declining trend. An analysis of pancreatic cancer mortality in East Asia also confirmed that while Japan still has the highest ASMR for pancreatic cancer, it has witnessed a downturn in both males and females after the year 2012, and the average annual percentage change in total population from 2012 to 2019 was -0.63%. South Korea is the second-highest ASMR country for pancreatic cancer, with the mortality continue to decline since 2011. A comparable declining trend was observed exclusively in East Asia, a region marked by a high socio-demographic index (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This could potentially be ascribed to their advanced economies and superior healthcare systems.</p><p>Our findings revealed a distinct age-related increase in pancreatic cancer risk, with greater risk in middle-aged and elderly individuals compared to younger populations. Over the study period, a steady increase in incidence was observed across all age groups, but most prominently among middle-aged and older adults. An APC study in East Asia also confirmed that the risk of death from pancreatic cancer increases with age (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This increase may be attributed to the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes, which have been proliferating due to the economic advancement of Asian countries. The annual increase in smoking rates also stands as a crucial factor contributing to this trend.</p><p>At continental level, population growth served as the most substantial driver of the increase in pancreatic cancer cases. Currently, more than 4 billion people live in Asia, accounting for 60% of the world&#8217;s population. It is predicted that by 2040, the global population will increase by 2.1 billion, of which 1 billion in Asia (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Closely followed by cases attributable to population aging. South and East Asia experienced the most pronounced rise in incidence, primarily attributable to population growth. In contrast, Central Asia&#8217;s increase in cases was largely due to epidemiological transitions, potentially linked to the region&#8217;s escalating smoking prevalence. Furthermore, factors such as deficient of prevention measures, limited access to quality healthcare, lack of available treatment options, scarcity of radiotherapy, absence of national cancer strategies, lack of multidisciplinary teams, intricate therapeutic geographies, and the uneven scale of social development might contribute to the increased incidence in Central Asia (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).These findings necessitate further investigation to uncover the factors of these trends and to devise targeted interventions aimed at alleviating the disease&#8217;s impact.</p><p>In Asia, individuals aged 55 and above bear the brunt of pancreatic cancer&#8217;s disease burden. The proportion of cases within this demographic expanded from 79% in 1990 to 84%, signifying an increasingly grave and rising burden of pancreatic cancer in older individuals. This disparity may be attributed to the cumulative exposure to various risk factors for cancer, including long-term smoking, high-fat diets, chronic pancreatitis, and obesity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The prolonged accumulation of these risk factors may lead to aberrant growth and carcinogenesis of pancreatic cells (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Furthermore, age-related physiological changes, such as reduced cellular repair and replacement rates, along with declining immune system capabilities, contribute to the heightened susceptibility of elderly individuals to pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The mortality and DALY rates associated with pancreatic cancer have both exhibited a discernible upward trajectory. With the ongoing demographic aging in Asian countries, particularly in highly populous nations like China and India, the burden of pancreatic cancer is likely to become more severe, potentially leading Asia to have the world&#8217;s highest disease burden.</p><p>We further compared the pancreatic cancer burden among those aged 55 and above to that of the other five most prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, namely, gastric, esophageal, liver, colorectal, and gallbladder and biliary tract cancers. Although pancreatic cancer mortality and DALY did not reach the highest levels compared to other GI cancers, but the mortality and DALY rate of pancreatic cancer showed a most rapidly increase among the six cancers. This surge could be attributed to population aging and changes in lifestyle (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>While Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies yield valuable health insights worldwide, they still face inherent limitations. Data quality varies due to inconsistent research design and implementation in different regions, impacting accuracy. One notable limitation is the potential for ecological fallacy, where associations observed at the population level might not reflect those at individual level. Hence, caution should be exercised when making inferences about individual risks based on population-level findings. Moreover, certain regions contribute unreliable or incomplete health data, thereby limiting the comprehensiveness of the GBD. Importantly, our study relied on the GBD&#8217;s available data, which meant that we could not incorporate all known risk factors for pancreatic cancer, such as alcohol consumption, due to their absence or lack of robust data in the database. Nonetheless, the 2019 GBD data appears more reliable than of the 2017 edition, possibly due to improved data collection, analytical methods, and overall data quality. Although these advancements are promising, we must cautiously interpret GBD data, considering its inherent limitations, and strive to improve its robustness through ongoing research and refinement (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the burden of pancreatic cancer in Asia, particularly among the elderly population, has been rising over the past three decades. This increase can be attributed to a combination of factors, including population aging, changes in lifestyle behaviors, and epidemiological shifts. The findings highlight the need for tailored interventions and policies targeting these high-risk populations and addressing modifiable risk factors such as smoking and obesity. It also underscores the importance of early detection and management strategies for pancreatic cancer to mitigate its public health impact, especially.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
