We investigated the association between pre-COPD diagnosis respiratory events and the incidence of exacerbations in a cohort of newly diagnosed COPD patients in Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were retrieved from the JMDC claims database. Patients &#8805;40 years old with a first COPD diagnosis (&#8805;1 hospitalization or &#8805;2 outpatient claims for COPD) between 2010 and 2016 were included. The incidence rate (IR) of exacerbations in patients with or without any respiratory event (including lower respiratory tract infection and respiratory failure) in the year preceding diagnosis was compared. A negative binomial model explored the association between pre-diagnosis respiratory event and IR ratio (IRR) of exacerbations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20,212 patients newly diagnosed with COPD were identified: 61% male, mean age 55 years (SD 9); of these, 955 (4.7%) had experienced &#8805;1 respiratory event in the year preceding diagnosis. Median duration of follow-up was 3.3 years during which the IR of exacerbations was 0.31 per patient-year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29&#8211;0.33) in patients with respiratory event, and 0.11 (95% CI 0.10&#8211;0.13) in patients without. The IR for severe exacerbation was nearly 10 times greater in patients with respiratory event versus without. Experiencing respiratory event pre-diagnosis was independently associated with an increased IRR of future moderate-to-severe exacerbation (adjusted IRR, 2.7; 95% CI 2.3&#8211;3.1).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients experiencing respiratory events in the year preceding COPD diagnosis should be considered at-risk of worse clinical COPD outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD diagnosis</kwd><kwd>lower respiratory tract infection</kwd><kwd>exacerbation</kwd><kwd>outcome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AstraZeneca</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/100004325</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by AstraZeneca.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; AECOPD) are periods of acute worsening of COPD symptoms (eg, breathlessness, cough, increased sputum volume) that extend beyond typical daily symptom variation of COPD and require a modification of treatment.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Approximately 40% to 60% of patients with COPD experience at least one AECOPD per year.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It was recently evidenced that even a single moderate AECOPD over a 12-month period is associated with an increased risk of future AECOPD.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;5</xref> AECOPD are also associated with lung function decline and increased risk of mortality.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The presence of respiratory events, namely lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), in patients prior to COPD diagnosis is important from a clinical standpoint.

The diagnosis of COPD was approximated by the presence of (1) healthcare claims for COPD care with either &#8805;1 hospitalization claim or &#8805;2 outpatient claims with a code for COPD using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10 codes J41-J44 as primary or secondary diagnosis); the date of the first identified COPD diagnosis was the index date; and (2) age &#8805;40 years at index date. In turn, patients were considered as newly diagnosed with COPD if they had no ICD-10 diagnostic code for COPD any time prior to index date (going back in time since the start of data availability).

Severe AECOPD were broadly defined as a hospitalization due to a respiratory event (AECOPD, LRTI, or acute respiratory failure in the absence of decompensated heart failure, pneumothorax or myocardial infarction and using the codes listed above). The definition of strictly-speaking exacerbation was extended to &#8220;respiratory infection&#8221; to minimize the risk of missing severe exacerbation events that would be coded as the co-occurring respiratory infection, if any.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2004"><title>Baseline Covariates</title><p>Baseline covariates included age at index date, sex, history of hospitalizations and outpatient visit (for any reason), comorbidities and respiratory medication. The presence of each comorbidity (yes/no) namely current asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcer, lung cancer, and several cardiovascular diseases was defined as &#8805;1 inpatient or &#8805;2 outpatient claims codes during baseline.

Descriptive analyses were conducted on patients&#8217; characteristics at baseline. To address objective 1, the number of patients experiencing at least one AECOPD (of any type, or separately for moderate and severe) during follow-up was described. The incidence rates (IRs) of AECOPD per patient-years of follow-up and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. To address objective 2, IR ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for the number of AECOPD of any type during follow-up (dependent variable) in association with having &#8805;1 baseline respiratory event (vs none, independent variable) were estimated using negative binomial models considering overdispersion of count data; follow-up time was used as an offset term. Univariable models were built for baseline respiratory events with each potential confounder (age, sex, and baseline comorbidities) as the independent variable. Variables associated with the number of AECOPD during follow-up with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value &lt;0.25 were included in a multivariable model.

The most frequently observed comorbidities (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were gastritis and duodenitis (44.8%), history of asthma (34.3%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (27.8%), gastric ulcer (25.6%), lung cancer (15.1%), stroke (14.1%), congestive heart failure (14.1%), and type 2 diabetes (11.1%). Less than one-third of patients had current asthma. During the baseline period, 955 (4.7%) patients had at least one respiratory event.

We estimated the rate of AECOPD during follow-up and explored the association between a history of a respiratory event (LRTI or respiratory failure) prior to COPD diagnosis and the IRR of future AECOPD.</p><sec id="s0004-s2001"><title>Characteristics of Newly Diagnosed Patients with COPD</title><p>In our cohort, patients were young (55 years old on average) due to recruitment of patients with a new diagnosis who were identified from an employees&#8217; private health insurance database.

As a comparison, in a cohort study conducted in the UK, more than 75% of newly diagnosed COPD patients experienced 1+ exacerbation over an average follow-up duration of 5 years.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The IR of exacerbation of any severity observed in our study was low, with IR = 0.12 (95% CI 0.12&#8211;0.12) exacerbation per patient-year of follow-up. Although it is well known that exacerbation rates are lower in the Japanese population compared with Western countries&#8217; populations (eg, due to genetic, ethnicity-related, and healthcare system-related factors), this rate is lower than in previous Japanese studies, which reported rates of exacerbations between 0.24 and 0.80 events per year in COPD populations, irrespective of patients&#8217; prior history of exacerbations.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Several reasons may explain the lower incidence of exacerbations found in the present study. First, COPD diagnosis relied on IDC-10 codes and age (&#8805;40 years old), but not on spirometry, which was unavailable in the database. It is possible that non-COPD patients were included, thus leading to underestimation of the incidence of exacerbations. Second, only newly diagnosed, younger patients were included, and the incidence of exacerbations may be lower at an early stage of the disease. Finally, data for our study population were retrieved from an employees&#8217; private health insurance database, which led to inclusion of individuals benefiting from better access to healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2003"><title>Frequency of Pre-Diagnosis Respiratory Events and Future Outcomes</title><p>Among the newly diagnosed patients, fewer than 5% had a respiratory event in the year preceding the first COPD diagnosis. These patients were more likely male and were older than patients who did not have any event. The level of cardiovascular comorbidity was markedly higher than in patients without a respiratory event, namely stroke (26% vs 14%), heart failure (36% vs 13%), acute myocardial infarction (11% vs 3%), and atrial fibrillation (8% vs 3%). Altogether, the presence of a respiratory event and of a high level of cardiovascular comorbidity may indicate more severe clinical status of COPD upon diagnosis. Moreover, the older age of this subgroup suggests that the diagnosis was made at a later stage of the disease. Because severe comorbid diseases may be associated with respiratory events, including COPD exacerbations, these characteristics were included as possible confounders in multivariable regression models. The observed association between pre-diagnosis respiratory events and subsequent exacerbations is not explained by the imbalance between the two groups at baseline, owing to these variables. However, residual confounding cannot be ruled out either.</p><p>The presence of a respiratory event in the year preceding COPD diagnosis (vs none) was infrequent but was associated with an increased rate of subsequent exacerbations. More importantly, these patients were at much higher risk of severe exacerbations, and the incidence of severe exacerbations was greater than the incidence of moderate exacerbations. The presence of a pre-diagnosis respiratory event was associated with a 2.7-fold increase in future exacerbation, independent of age and comorbidities. This result is in line with recent findings using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database in the UK, where severe LRTI in the year preceding diagnosis was found to increase the risk of future exacerbations (IRR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.5&#8211;1.6).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2004"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>In claims databases, the sensitivity and precision of identifying patients diagnosed with chronic diseases may vary. Moreover, routine clinical care diagnosis may also not always align with guidelines recommended criteria for diagnosis of COPD. Regarding COPD, the database does not contain information on spirometry, GOLD stage, or smoking status. The identification of COPD patients thus relied on a combination of diagnoses made by prescribers for claims purposes. The use of a minimum age (40 years old) and of several codes in the inclusion criteria aimed to minimize the risk of including patients that do not have GOLD-defined COPD.</p><p>In addition, the duration of COPD was not collected, nor approximated. We included patients at the moment of the first diagnosis indicated by the physician, which does not necessarily correspond to the early stage of the disease. In our study, long-acting bronchodilators were used by 16% of patients with respiratory events during baseline, suggesting that respiratory symptoms were present in the absence of, and prior to, a formal diagnosis being made. However, the period of the diagnosis is important in the course of this chronic disease as it provides the opportunity for physicians to assess the severity of the disease and anticipate future risk. In this perspective, the identification of prior respiratory events that were not identified as exacerbations of COPD is useful in terms of future risk assessment. Our results suggest that respiratory events preceding the period of the diagnosis are indicative of a more severe course of the disease once diagnosed.</p><p>Finally, the present study used data on COPD patients managed between 2010 and 2017. It is possible that patterns of COPD diagnosis or management in Japan have changed since then, thus limiting the applicability of our results to a more recent period.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2005"><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>The presence of a respiratory event shortly before COPD diagnosis is indicative of a higher risk of future severe exacerbations. The association between a pre-diagnosis respiratory event and subsequent exacerbations may reflect a pattern of susceptibility to severe respiratory events that remains constant in the first 3 or 4 years after diagnosis, irrespective of baseline confounders such as age at diagnosis.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For instance, LRTIs starting early in life are associated with future subnormal lung function,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which, in turn, may be one of the several mechanisms behind COPD.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> From this perspective, respiratory events such as LRTIs may be considered as markers of COPD risk and poorer prognosis. However, it should be noted that other potential confounders such as smoking, exposure to air pollutants or eosinophil count<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> could not be accounted for in our models because data on them are not collected in the JMDC database.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, patients who experience an LRTI or acute respiratory failure in the year preceding the first COPD diagnosis should be considered at higher risk of worse clinical COPD outcomes and could benefit from closer medical monitoring.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Masato Ishida and Ai Hayashi, former employees of AstraZeneca, for their contributions to the study.</p></ack><sec id="s0006"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AECOPD, acute exacerbations of COPD; CI, confidence interval; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; IQR, interquartile range; IR, incidence rate; IRR, incidence rate ratio; LABA, long-acting &#946;2-agonist; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonists; LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; RR, risk ratio; SABA, short-acting &#946;2-agonist; SAMA, short-acting muscarinic antagonist; SD, standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>Data underlying the findings described in this manuscript may be obtained in accordance with AstraZeneca&#8217;s data sharing policy described at <underline><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://astrazenecagrouptrials.pharmacm.com/ST/Submission/Disclosure" ext-link-type="uri">https://astrazenecagrouptrials.pharmacm.com/ST/Submission/Disclosure</ext-link></underline>.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Ethics Approval and Informed Consent</title><p>Patient-level data were provided after anonymization.
