For each information type, we created a value of 1 for always/often and 0 for all others (sometimes, rarely, never, don&#8217;t know) and summed up the values for each hospital. We then created an indicator of high HIE-outside clinical information equals 1 if hospitals always/often received six or more types of clinical information from outside providers (i.e., above the 75th percentile of score 6 of the distribution of HIE-outside clinical information) and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The second key independent variable asks that when patients who were admitted to your hospital had been tested for COVID-19 outside of your health system, to what extent did the hospital receive results from each entity in an electronic format.

For each entity, we created a value of 1 for always/often and 0 for all others (sometimes, rarely, never, don&#8217;t know).

Our findings are consistent with previous research that shows associations between beneficial health care outcomes from telehealth and health information technology-related features for patients with ADRD (<xref rid="bibr30-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">N. Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Research has also shown a beneficial association between hospital Meaningful Use (MU) of electronic health records (EHRs) and process quality, suggesting a connection between technological investment and utilization, clinical information availability, and quality of care, which may be especially meaningful for patients with complex health needs such as those with ADRD (<xref rid="bibr16-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">Y. K. Lin et al., 2019</xref>). For patients with ADRD, the added challenges surrounding memory and communication heighten the need for electronic information exchange, which can be used by hospital clinicians to obtain outside clinical information and coordinate with primary care physicians to create a care plan for health services outside of the ED setting.</p><p>Specifically, the results of the study showed that obtaining test results for COVID-19 from entities outside of the hospital was associated with lower odds of having a preventable ED visit for patients with ADRD. COVID-19 testing for patients with ADRD is crucial to creating appropriate care plans during the pandemic, as a recent study showed that a sample of 14 patients with pre-existing dementia who tested positive for COVID-19 had all experienced greater fatigue and depression, worsening memory and attention, and 10 of them required hospitalization after a one-year follow-up (<xref rid="bibr7-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">Dubey et al., 2023</xref>). Testing for COVID-19 early in the pandemic was crucial for determining COVID-19 transmission rates and was performed in a variety of health care, community, and home settings (<xref rid="bibr19-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al., 2020</xref>). The pandemic spotlighted the need for health information exchange capability between hospitals and a variety of partners, and greater standardization of health data and systems compatibility.</p><p>Our results also find racial and ethnic disparities in the odds of having a preventable ED visit during COVID-19. Previous research by the CDC shows that Black and Hispanic patients had 1.4 times the rate of emergency department visits for COVID-19 during October&#8211;December 2020 compared to White patients (<xref rid="bibr23-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study shows that enhanced HIT infrastructures can improve patient engagement and care coordination and identify patients&#8217; needs that can improve racial and ethnic health disparities among patients with ADRD (<xref rid="bibr6-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">J. Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Another study on HIT quality found that the effect sizes of attaining MU of EHRs for process quality of care were larger in small and rural hospitals, which led authors to conclude that HIT may mitigate disparities in the quality of health care (<xref rid="bibr16-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">Y. K. Lin et al., 2019</xref>). It is imperative that ADRD research continue to analyze both technology&#8217;s ability to reduce health care disparities and the effects of the digital divide.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. First, this study is a cross-sectional analysis and does not infer causality about its results. Second, we acknowledge that we measured hospital-level HIE adoption and hence an intent to treat analysis. There is a lack of data on the actual use of the information being exchanged for each ED visit. Third, we used multiple indices of HIE measures to test the overall variation. Future research may focus on specific aspects of information exchange tailored to different patient characteristics, health needs, and social determinants of health. Fourth, there may be omitted variables such as disease severity and cultural preferences of data sharing and privacy that are not measured in the data. Finally, our sample consists of six states and may not be nationally representative.</p><sec id="section8-23337214241244984"><title>Policy Implications</title><p>Alternative payment models (APMs) that reward quality and require collaboration financially incentivize greater health information exchange among providers and across the health care continuum. For example, earlier work showed ACO-affiliated hospitals had 0.91 lower adjusted odds of preventable ED visits for patients with ADRD compared with hospitals not affiliated with an ACO (<xref rid="bibr29-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">N. Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Another study found APMs were associated with greater hospital health information exchange diversity, breadth, and depth than volume-based contracts, leading researchers to conclude that value-based payment models may be an effective driver of hospital health information exchange infrastructure, and able to overcome the competitive forces beneath information blocking (<xref rid="bibr15-23337214241244984" ref-type="bibr">S. C. Lin et al., 2019</xref>). While our study does not differentiate payment model type within payer entities, the finding that health information exchange of COVID-19 diagnosis results is associated with a reduction in preventable ED visit rate underscores the importance of health information exchange in reducing preventable ED visits for patients with ADRD and indicates that policymakers should continue to advocate for and incentivize payment structures that attract collaboration and health information exchange. We believe future research that analyzes contract type, health information exchange, and preventable ED visits for ADRD care is important.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section9-23337214241244984"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic prompted efficiency in health care decision-making, and electronic information exchange can make the health care delivery and planning process more efficient. The results of our study show that the availability of electronic health information exchange from multiple health care entities is associated with lower odds of having a preventable ED visit. Hospitals can promote information exchange by coordinating efforts with local outside entities and ensuring that information can be easily exchanged and processed when needed. Further research can examine other potential benefits of hospital-based information exchange, such as its use in care coordination outside of hospital settings, public health reporting, and planning for future pandemics and disasters.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging Grant [R01AG062315 and RF1AG083175].</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical Approval:</bold> This study was approved by the University of Maryland IRB (institutional review board) as a secondary data analysis of deidentified patients with minimal risk, as such patients were waived from informed consent by the University of Maryland IRB.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Nianyang Wang <inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1177_23337214241244984-img1.jpg"/>
