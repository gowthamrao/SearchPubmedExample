The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment model guided implementation activities and support through the phases of implementing CoCM. The Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-Based Interventions guided our documentation of adaptations to process-of-care elements and structural elements of CoCM.

Many PWH do not receive behavioral health (BH) care due largely to a shortage of trained practitioners and fragmentation of care services. In the United States, mental health and substance use treatment are not typically colocated or integrated with HIV medical care. A subset of PWH who have mental health and substance use disorders&#8212;particularly in the context of poverty, unstable housing, and low social support&#8212;do not engage in conventionally organized HIV medical care. Low-barrier HIV care is an evidence-based model of service delivery designed to engage and treat this population (<xref rid="bibr10-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The Max Clinic in Seattle is a flagship low-barrier HIV clinic that includes walk-in access to primary care, incentives for clinical visits and viral suppression, intensive case management support, and multisector care coordination (including jails, supportive housing, and a day support program) (<xref rid="bibr152-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Dombrowski, et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bibr153-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Dombrowski, et al., 2019</xref>). This model has successfully increased viral suppression, the goal of HIV treatment, among PWH with complex needs. However, the lack of BH care within the clinic is a critical gap in the model. Based on a review of medical records, 69% of patients enrolled in the Max Clinic have a psychiatric diagnosis at the time of enrollment and 85% use substances (stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines, or hazardous alcohol use). Prior to this project, mental health services were provided primarily through referral to specialty mental health services that were external to the clinic but located on the same medical campus. A retrospective review demonstrated that fewer than half of referred patients completed even one visit (<xref rid="bibr150-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Altwies et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In 2021, we integrated BH care for depression and opioid use disorder (OUD) into the low-barrier clinic as part of an NIH-funded implementation science pilot grant to integrate BH care in HIV clinics funded by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. We selected the evidence-based collaborative care management (CoCM) model, which integrates mental health care in nonpsychiatric settings using a task-sharing approach with a BH care manager and a remote psychiatric specialist supervisor working in collaboration with the primary medical team (<xref rid="bibr12-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Chwastiak et al., 2014</xref>). The care manager delivers brief evidence-based psychological interventions and supports pharmacologic management of mental health and substance use disorders in partnership with primary care providers and uses a registry to track patient progress toward measurement-based treatment targets. We focused on depression and OUD for this project because both conditions are common among PWH (<xref rid="bibr17-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Do et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Lemons et al., 2020</xref>) and extensive evidence supports CoCM for the treatment of depression in the context of primary care (<xref rid="bibr5-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al., 2012</xref>). Collaborative care for OUD in the context of office-based opioid treatment (<xref rid="bibr2-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Alford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">LaBelle et al., 2016</xref>) has been widely implemented in diverse settings, including low-barrier treatment settings (<xref rid="bibr3-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Alford et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We recognized that adaptation of the CoCM model was important because of the atypical service environment of a low-barrier clinic and the necessity to fit with the needs of the target patient population. The purpose of this report is to describe our process of adapting CoCM for the Max Clinic. We used Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) as the primary guiding framework for implementing the adapted intervention and the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence Based Interventions (FRAME) to document adaptations. We illustrate how the components of the adapted intervention operationalize the core elements of CoCM and detail the implementation strategies we used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-26334895231167105"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2A-26334895231167105"><title>Setting and Staffing Prior to Implementation</title><p>The Max Clinic is jointly operated by a county health department (Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County) and a large public safety net hospital operated by an academic medical center (Harborview Medical Center). The clinic is colocated with the municipal sexual health clinic. The clinic approach and patient population are described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr151-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Beima-Sofie et al., 2020</xref>; Dombrowski et al., 2018; Dombrowski et al., 2019). Briefly, the Max Clinic enrolls PWH who are virally unsuppressed and/or not taking antiretroviral therapy who have not successfully re-engaged in care and treatment after prior outreach attempts from the health department or clinic staff. Although the Max Clinic is designed specifically for people with HIV, the care model and patient population are similar to other clinics designed for people with complex medical and social needs (The National Center for Complex Health &amp; Social Needs, <xref rid="bibr30-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>People who enroll in the Max Clinic receive primary care (including HIV treatment) and case management at the clinic. The demographics of the patient population generally reflect those of all people living with HIV in King County, although proportionately more cisgender women, transgender persons, and people who inject drugs are enrolled in the Max Clinic. At the end of 2021, approximately 300 patients had ever been enrolled in the clinic and 230 patients remained actively enrolled. Almost all patients of the clinic remain enrolled for the duration of their care. Very few patients (&lt;10 from 2015 to 2021) &#8220;graduate&#8221; from the low-barrier clinic to a conventional clinic.</p><p>Prior to this project, the Max Clinic team included: (1) infectious disease physicians (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5) who provided team-based HIV care (and primary care) in which the physicians did not have individual panels of patients, (2) clinical social workers (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3) who provided medical case management, including referrals to support services and assistance with securing medical insurance, housing, food, and disability services; and (3) public health disease intervention specialists (DIS; <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4) who provided patient navigation services, psychosocial support, outreach to engage patients in the clinic, assistance with obtaining bus passes, and general coordination of clinic flow.</p></sec><sec id="section2B-26334895231167105"><title>Evidence-Based Intervention</title><p>CoCM is based on the chronic care model, a framework for improving care for people with chronic diseases by reorganizing the delivery of services using a team-based, proactive, population-oriented approach (<xref rid="bibr12-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Chwastiak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Wagner, 2000</xref>). The key elements of CoCM include (1) patient-centered team care; (2) systematic screening of patients for the target health condition; (3) evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment; (4) continual care management using an electronic registry and case review meetings with a psychiatric consultant; and (5) measurement-based care to track treatment response, identify patients who are not improving, and adjust treatment for patients who are not meeting targets (<xref rid="bibr24-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">McGinty &amp; Daumit, 2020</xref>; University of Washington AIMS Center, 2022a). This model has been extensively studied in primary care medical settings and is typically delivered as a structured, time-limited intervention involving close follow-up and monitoring of progress toward treatment targets.</p></sec><sec id="section2C-26334895231167105"><title>Implementation Model and Assessment Framework</title><p>The EPIS framework was used to guide implementation activities and support through the phases of implementing CoCM in the Max Clinic (<xref rid="bibr26-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Moullin et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, the adaptation of CoCM we describe here was located within both the preparation and implementation phases in response to inner/outer contextual factors we encountered while exploring and preparing to implement CoCM. During the planning phase, the research team had weekly meetings. Once the implementation began, the CoCM clinical team met weekly and the research team met approximately twice monthly to review progress, discuss problems and possible solutions, and make adaptations as needed.</p><p>To describe adaptations to the CoCM model, we used the FRAME (<xref rid="bibr33-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Wiltsey Stirman et al., 2019</xref>), which supports systematic tracking and documentation of the rationale for modifications made to evidence-based interventions (<xref rid="bibr1-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Ametaj et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr6-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Baratta et al., 2021</xref>).

In-depth interviews with service delivery stakeholders included all providers and staff in the Max Clinic (physicians, social workers, and DIS); clinic managers; the supervisor of the Max Clinic social workers; and the director of Psychiatry in the HIV clinic located with the associated medical center. Patient interviews included Max Clinic patients who would be eligible for CoCM based on a diagnosis of depression or documented opioid use.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Patient receipt of services at multiple agencies</italic>&#8212;Among the 30 patients enrolled during the pilot phase of the low barrier clinic CoCM program, we observed a consistent pattern in which patients were formally established with BH providers outside of the Max Clinic but were not fully or consistently engaged in those services. Although we had decided during the planning phase to exclude patients engaged in treatment elsewhere, in practice, many patients had a sporadic engagement at several different agencies or had a single encounter at another agency without follow-up. In response, the role of the nurse care manager increasingly emphasized coordination of BH services across systems with the goal of ensuring that the individual treatment plan could be advanced whether the patient was in the Max Clinic, admitted to the hospital, or in another care setting (e.g., a day program for people with HIV, a supportive housing facility, or a methadone treatment clinic). This required the BH nurse care manager and consulting psychiatrist to coordinate with other agencies to clarify and advance the individual treatment plan collaboratively, particularly regarding medication changes. While care coordination is a central role of a BH manager in the CoCM model, this activity accounted for more of the BH care manager's effort than we envisioned during the planning phase. Sharing information across organizations for this purpose was feasible since the federal law governing the privacy of health information (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) permits the disclosure of protected health information between healthcare providers for the purpose of coordinating treatment, case management, and care. Moreover, patients sign a release of information forms upon enrollment in the clinic. Most of the coordination was done by phone, through the electronic health record messaging system, or through secure e-mail.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Heterogeneity in patient engagement</italic>&#8212;In the first 6 months of the program, we observed substantial differences in the level of patient engagement with the BH care manager after accepting a referral. Some patients expressed interest in the program but repeatedly deferred meeting with the nurse care manager for the intake process. The Max Clinic care team reported perceptions that patients had time constraints or did not feel ready (or were otherwise unwilling) to engage in a formal intake process. In response, we recognized the need for additional activities related to engagement with the BH nurse care manager and developed a process for the care manager to greet patients briefly or add sessions focused on building rapport and increasing engagement prior to conducting a formal intake assessment.</p></list-item></list>In response to these two factors, the low barrier clinic CoCM program evolved to include different care pathways including (1) direct treatment (behavioral or medication), with or without care coordination, (2) care coordination only (without direct treatment), or for patients with minimal to no engagement in CoCM, (3) focus on engaging patients in BH services wherever possible. Specifically, for the third group, this meant meeting with patients in less structured interactions and shorter visits than a formal intake to generate rapport with the patient and work toward more in-depth assessment and therapeutic encounters over time.</p></sec><sec id="section3B-26334895231167105"><title>Adaptations to Process-of-Care Elements</title><p>The key contextual factors that required adaptation to process elements of collaborative care (<xref rid="table2-26334895231167105" ref-type="table">Table&#160;2</xref>) were the lack of scheduled appointments and formal screening and assessment processes at the time of check-in to the Max Clinic, the relatively small population of patients who were already well-known to the Max clinical care team, and time constraints with competing priorities for patient care.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="table2-26334895231167105" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;2</label><caption><p>Process Elements of the Collaborative Care Model as Adapted for Integrating Behavioral Health Services into a Low Barrier HIV Clinic</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10.1177_26334895231167105-table2.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Element</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Adapted or maintained</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Description</th><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Adaptation decisions<sup>a</sup></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Who decided?</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">When?</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Why?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Team-based care by general medical and specialty behavioral health providers</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#160;Maintained</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weekly systematic case review (<xref rid="bibr7-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2019</xref>) with behavioral health nurse care manager, psychiatrist consultant, and HIV physician</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Proactive and systematic patient identification and connection to treatment</td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Adapted</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step 1: Targeted screening of established patients based on social work assessment (&#8764;3 months)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Small group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preimplementation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Improve context fit and acceptability</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step 2: Broadened screening to various staff and staged attempt to reach all potential CoCM candidates</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Early implementation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Improve reach</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Information tracking and exchange among behavioral and medical providers</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#160;Maintained</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient caseload tracker used in case conferences, electronic health record documentation for sharing information with all team members</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systematic quality improvement</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adapted<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The program was piloted with an iterative process of improvement lacking the formality of plan-do-study-act cycles.

The most rigorous approach involves systematic screening with validated tools. For CoCM programs in primary care settings with large patient populations, this typically includes clinical support staff such as medical assistants screening for the target health conditions at the beginning of a visit. Prior to implementing CoCM, the Max Clinic procedures included a social worker or DIS rooming the patient and verbally inquiring about the patient's key concerns and priorities for the visit. The Max Clinic had not previously implemented standardized screening or intake forms and the team had explicitly decided to minimize these approaches to streamline the process of care and focus on patients&#8217; priorities and expressed needs. Moreover, because the clinic population is relatively small, most patients are well-known to the Max Clinic care team, and most already have either established diagnoses of depression or documented opioid use, the introduction of formal screening tools was inconsistent with the clinic culture.</p><p>Nonetheless, the CoCM program needed a process to assess patient eligibility for the clinical program. We defined eligibility as having one of the following: (1) a score of &#8805;10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), following a positive PHQ-2 screen or (2) OUD, defined as an affirmation of opioid use on a brief screen (the National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA] Quick Screen). A positive opioid use screen was followed by a BH care manager assessment for OUD using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5. The CoCM program excluded patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder because the core components of the model (evidence-based brief behavioral treatments and measurement-based care) were specific for depression and OUD. (Initially, we planned to exclude patients who were currently engaged in BH treatment elsewhere, but as described above, this was rapidly modified.)</p><p>In the preimplementation phase, the small group decided to implement a targeted assessment process in which social workers or physicians would complete the PHQ-9 and NIDA Quick Screen with patients whom they assessed could be eligible for CoCM prior to referral. The small group made this adaptation to increase the context fit and acceptability of the CoCM program to the Max Clinic team. The approach avoided some of the barriers to systematic screening, allowed for a more predictable flow of patients into the program, and allowed social workers and physicians to make a clinical judgment about whether and when screening for CoCM was appropriate. This facilitated integration of the BH nurse care manager, who was new to the team at the beginning of the program. Additionally, this process allowed the social work or physician to directly evaluate a patient who expressed suicidality, whereas a DIS would need to link such patients to a social worker for evaluation.</p><p>During the early implementation period, the CoCM clinical team and research team identified low levels of screening and linkage to the program. This was primarily due to two issues. First, roles remained unclear and some Max Clinic team members questioned the approach of depending on social workers to complete formal screening instruments and referrals. Second, the Max team reported that completing PHQ-9 assessments was time-consuming and difficult. Specifically, during the process of attempting to administer the PHQ-9, social workers reported difficulty keeping patients focused on completing the screening instrument. In response to the PHQ-9 items, patients often went into complex discussions of their experience rather than responding directly with the frequency of symptoms as the instrument requires. Additionally, some patients expressed concern about depression or opioid use, but deferred further discussion when the need to complete the PHQ-9 was broached. Finally, the team requested that patients who were specifically seeking or interested in MOUD could be referred without a PHQ-9 to screen for depression.</p><p>In response, we changed procedures so that the BH nurse care manager contributed to rooming patients and we opened the opportunity for any member of the team to conduct screening and refer patients. By this point, the BH nurse care manager was established in the clinic as part of the care team. After discussion with the larger group of the Max Clinic and research teams, the program goal changed to screening every patient who did not have a condition that would exclude them from CoCM during at least one visit by any member of the Max team. A completed PHQ-9 was not required for referral to initiate MOUD.</p><p>Systematic quality improvement&#8212;Longitudinal measurement of process and outcome metrics with systematic assessment and improvement processes is a core component of BH integration in primary care. The systematic quality improvement includes the use of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to conduct incremental tests of change. In the early implementation phase of the CoCM program, we focused on developing the program with an iterative approach, inviting feedback from all members of the Max Clinic team, the small group, the CoCM clinical team, and the research group as part of the implementation strategy described above. For example, when we identified lower-than-expected screening rates at the start of the project, we discussed the issue and potential solutions with the social workers and DIS, and subsequently the entire Max team, before changing the screening process. In response to the psychiatric complexity of patients enrolled in the program (high rates of co-occurring mental health disorders) and need to coordinate across systems, we adapted the context of weekly case reviews with the psychiatrist to address comorbid conditions in the treatment plan and largely focused on the details of care coordination across providers in different systems.</p><p>The process of iteration during program development and piloting lacked the formality and systematicity of PDSA cycles. In our assessment, the process of rapid iteration was well-suited to the early implementation phase, but a more systematic quality improvement process will be needed during the maintenance phase of the program.</p><p>Measurement-based care&#8212;Evidence-based BH treatment requires ongoing symptom monitoring and treatment adjustment. A standard target for CoCM for depression is a 50% decrease in the PHQ-9 or remission (PHQ-9&#8201;&lt;&#8201;5; <xref rid="bibr13-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Coley et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of consensus in the field about OUD treatment targets, we pre-specified the measure-based care target for the CoCM program as stabilization and retention as measured by maintenance on MOUD medications and, if prescribed buprenorphine, evidence of buprenorphine in the urine drug test result.</p><p>In the process of care after CoCM enrollment, the BH nurse care manager frequently encountered difficulties completing regular PHQ-9 assessments for reasons that were somewhat different from those reported by social workers during the screening process. As ascertained in the discussions during systematic case review meetings and research team meetings, these included: (1) patients in acute crisis or expressing a specific need that the BH nurse care manager assessed as a higher priority to address than completing the PHQ-9, (2) patients declining to complete the PHQ-9, (3) patients telling the BH nurse they manipulated the answers to the PHQ-9 items, and (4) patients willing to engage with the BH nurse for only a short time, during which she prioritized discussion and counseling rather than PHQ-9 assessment. In response, the psychiatrist offered suggestions to overcome the barriers as appropriate and ongoing support to continue efforts to obtain PHQ-9 assessments when feasible and appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="section3C-26334895231167105"><title>Workflow of Adapted Intervention</title><p><xref rid="fig1-26334895231167105" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref> summarizes the workflow of CoCM in the Max Clinic at the end of the early implementation period (6 months), reflecting the adaptations described above.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1-26334895231167105" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure&#160;1</label><caption><p>Collaborative Care Management Workflow in the Low-Barrier HIV Clinic</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10.1177_26334895231167105-fig1.jpg"/><attrib><italic toggle="yes">Note</italic>.

Although the context of the low barrier HIV clinic required adaptation to the process elements of CoCM, we were able to maintain the core structural elements. In the early implementation phase, we rapidly adapted the program to focus on care coordination across systems as necessitated by the complexity of the patient needs and the commonality of partial engagement in multiple systems of care. As such, the relative importance of care coordination versus direct service delivery was different than we envisioned in the planning phase but remained consistent with the CoCM model. The program evolved to include different care pathways based on the needs and engagement level of each patient enrolled.</p><p>From the standpoint of care processes, we primarily modified the approach to screening (proactively) and measurement-based care (reactively). Although our screening approach evolved to a universal one, our decision to begin with targeted screening was important to increase the context fit of the intervention and facilitated staff acceptability. The Max Clinic care team and BH care team reported substantial difficulties with the PHQ-9, both in screening and in measurement-based care after enrollment. Staff reported some difficulties with introducing any standardized screening instrument into a clinical encounter, including the initial screen of the PHQ-2, because many patients were coming to the clinic to address urgent needs or to pick up an incentive. Some staff reported finding it difficult to switch from a personal conversation to a standardized instrument and perceived this as off-putting to the patients, and others found that it was difficult to complete in a short period of time as intended because it opened the door to patient conversations about the content the PHQ-9 assesses. While we could surmount some of the problems at the time of screening with adjustment of the program processes, completion of the PHQ-9 in ongoing care remained a persistent challenge. This experience is substantially different from CoCM in the primary care setting, in which screening with PHQ-9 is feasible and widely used, and repeated completion of the PHQ-9 is an essential part of monitoring care outcomes during treatment for depression. The extent to which our experience reflects issues common to complex care settings and high-need patient populations versus particular factors of our site is uncertain. Future qualitative work will better quantify the extent to which and elucidate the reasons why the PHQ-9 screening and monitoring was difficult to implement in the Max Clinic.</p><p>Our report builds upon the existing literature on CoCM. While the model has been extensively studied in primary care clinics in the United States and globally, and conventional HIV care settings (<xref rid="bibr14-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Cubillos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Curran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Gilbody et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">McGinty &amp; Daumit, 2020</xref>), we are not aware of reports describing its adaptation for treatment of depression in low-barrier HIV clinics or other complex care settings. Many of the factors we encountered during the initial implementation of the CoCM model in a low barrier HIV clinic setting reinforce findings from studies of CoCM in other settings. Role clarity is an important factor in the effectiveness of collaborative care, and many programs must address lack of clarity around roles early in implementation (<xref rid="bibr25-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Moise et al., 2018</xref>). As in other settings, the need for ongoing improvements continued at the end of the early implementation period in our clinic. Improved depression outcomes at an organizational level take a substantial amount of time (up to 2 years) and maintenance of gains requires sustained work on the processes of care (<xref rid="bibr9-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Carlo et al., 2019</xref>). Longitudinal support with structured monitoring and feedback on treatment processes and clinical outcomes is one method to sustain improvements over time (<xref rid="bibr31-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Unutzer et al., 2020</xref>). We encountered challenges coordinating care across multiple systems, which is a common issue in providing care for patients with complex comorbidities that require cross-disciplinary collaboration. An ongoing study of collaborative care for patients with OUD and psychiatric comorbidity is comparing augmented usual care for MOUD (primary care provider working with consulting psychiatrist), collaborative care (addition of a mental health care manager to the team), and &#8220;collaborative care plus&#8221; (addition of a certified recovery specialist to the collaborative care model; <xref rid="bibr19-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The primary strengths of this implementation report are that we designed and described our implementation strategy consistent with best practices in the Implementation Science literature, we used EPIS as a guiding framework for implementation, and we systematically documented our adaptations in line with FRAME. The final product of our adaptation process may not be generalizable to other settings, but this is by design since the goal of this work was to adapt the CoCM model to our specific local context. However, the experience we report here is highly transferrable to other settings that serve high-need complex patient populations.</p><sec id="section4A-26334895231167105"><title>Future Directions</title><p>The low-barrier HIV care approach is expanding in multiple areas of the United States as part of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, and the emerging specialty of complex care demonstrates the ubiquity of need for medical models tailored to serve patients with complex medical and social needs. This is an early report, and the sustainability of the approach we present in <xref rid="fig1-26334895231167105" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref> is by no means static. Consistent with the Dynamic Sustainability Framework (<xref rid="bibr11-26334895231167105" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 2013</xref>), we expect that ongoing adaptations over time will be necessary to improve the model. Forthcoming and future work includes a thematic analysis of preimplementation interviews and postimplementation mixed method evaluation.</p><p>In summary, we have described an adapted model of CoCM to integrate BH care into a low-barrier care setting for people with HIV that maintained the core structural elements of the intervention while adapting the process of care to fit the context. We found that it was feasible to implement the model using a multicomponent strategy and iteratively adapt it during the early implementation phase. This work can inform efforts to integrate CoCM into other care settings for people with complex social and medical needs, including those designed to serve high-need people with HIV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section5-26334895231167105"><title>Acknolwedgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Matthew Golden, who provided conceptual input on this project during its formation, all members of the Max Clinic team during this process who were essential to implementation of the CoCM program (Nordia Shackelford, Xico Ceballos, Sarah Stewart, Aleks Martin, Allison Moore, Angela Nunez, Courtney Large, Portney Shibale, Ray Samonte, McKenna Eastment, Chase Cannon, Elaine Thomas), other people who supported the development and implementation of the CoCM program (Elizabeth Barash, Katie Hara, and Sandra Herrera), and all of the Max Clinic patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health, including the following: R34 MH124625; the University of Washington/Fred Hutch Center for AIDS Research, an NIH-funded program under award number AI 027757 which is supported by the following NIH Institutes and Centers: NIAID, NCI, NIMH, NIDA, NICHD, NHLBI, NIA, NIGMS, NIDDK; and the University of Washington Behavioral Research Center for HIV (BIRCH), an NIMH-funded program (P30 MH123248).
