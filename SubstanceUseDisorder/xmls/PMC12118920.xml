UKB is a large cohort study with over 500,000 volunteer participants aged 40&#8211;69 years when recruited in 2006&#8211;2010. It is an important resource of extensive health, genetic and biomarker data. Enhancements to UKB enrich the data available. MHQ2 is an enhancement designed to enable and facilitate research with psychosocial and mental health aspects.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Methods</title><p>UKB sent participants a link to MHQ2 by email in October-November 2022. The MHQ2 was designed by a multi-institutional consortium to build on MHQ1. It characterises lifetime depression further, adds data on panic disorder and eating disorders, repeats &#8216;current&#8217; mental health measures and updates information about social circumstances. It includes established measures, such as the PHQ-9 for current depression and CIDI-SF for lifetime panic, as well as bespoke questions. Algorithms and R code were developed to facilitate analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Results</title><p>At the time of analysis, MHQ2 results were available for 169,253 UKB participants, of whom 111,275 had also completed the earlier MHQ1. Characteristics of respondents and the whole UKB cohort are compared. The major phenotypes are lifetime: depression (18%); panic disorder (4.0%); a specific eating disorder (2.8%); and bipolar affective disorder I (0.4%). All mental disorders are found less with older age and also seem to be related to selected social factors. In those participants who answered both MHQ1 (2016) and MHQ2 (2022), current mental health measure showed that fewer respondents have harmful alcohol use than in 2016 (relative risk 0.84), but current depression (RR 1.07) and anxiety (RR 0.98) have not fallen, as might have been expected given the relationship with age. We also compare lifetime concepts for test-retest reliability.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are some drawbacks to UKB due to its lack of population representativeness, but where the research question does not depend on this, it offers exceptional resources that any researcher can apply to access. This paper has just scratched the surface of the results from MHQ2 and how this can be combined with other tranches of UKB data, but we predict it will enable many future discoveries about mental health and health in general.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>No specific funding was received for this work.

There is still a lot about mental health and disorder that we do not understand, and there is an urgent need for research to improve our ability to promote good mental health or treat disordered mental health [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Early mortality of people with severe mental disorders from physical health conditions is likely part of a reciprocal relationship between poor physical and mental health, which reinforces the importance of considering mental health in wider medical research [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study was established with the scale and depth to help researchers grapple with complex questions about conditions that are life-threatening or disabling in adults [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such conditions seldom have a single cause; instead, their onsets and prognoses are associated with many risk factors, including genetic variants at multiple loci, exposures at any time from conception onwards, and interactions between them [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many conditions also tend to cluster, causing further problems in investigating specific causal mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These features of high complexity are true for most mental disorders [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Traditional epidemiological designs of modest sample sizes and limited data capture are not well suited to these challenges [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The very large sample size and detail of data in UKB offers great potential for investigating many facets of mental disorders in adults.</p><p>UKB recruited over half a million individuals aged 40&#8211;69 between 2006 and 2010. The baseline assessment was extensive, with physical measures, biological sample collection (blood and urine in all, saliva in 100,000), a touchscreen questionnaire and an interview that gathered information on early life and current behaviour, as detailed on their website [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. An impressive list of potential biomarkers has been established, and participants&#8217; approximate addresses have been used to provide measures such as area deprivation, access to green spaces and air pollution [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A subset of participants has been characterised even further through &#8216;enhancements&#8217;, including via multimodal imaging (including neuroimaging), activity/sleep monitoring, and cognitive testing. Further data, including information on health outcomes, have been obtained through consented linkage to routinely collected information, including hospital in-patient statistics, cancer registry, COVID-19 vaccination data, death certification, and data from the primary care electronic health records for a subset of the cohort [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>To realise the potential of UKB for mental health research, and mental aspects of physical health, a mental health outcomes (MHO) consortium was created, which made recommendations for an online questionnaire about current and past mental disorders and associated features. In 2016&#8211;17 participants were invited via email and postal newsletter to complete this first web-based questionnaire (MHQ1), leading to responses from over 157,000 individuals by July 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The core of the questionnaire was an assessment of lifetime depression and generalised anxiety status, which allowed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for these disorders [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but also facilitated non-genetic studies, touching on many other aspects of mental health research, as detailed in a recent review of the use of UKB for mental health research [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Recognising the changeability of mental health and the limitations of a single questionnaire to capture complex diagnoses, the MHO consortium proposed a second mental health questionnaire (MHQ2). Alterations were made to reflect the changing priorities of research following the COVID-19 pandemic. Like its predecessor, MHQ2 was not a distinct entity, but a collection of &#8216;modules&#8217; that contained measures on a particular diagnostic or exposure topic. When choosing measures, consideration was given to comparability and complementarity with other cohort studies in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and experiences of using MHQ1 data. Scales on current depression, anxiety and alcohol use were repeated from MHQ1 to allow examination of possible fluctuation of these symptoms. MHQ2 also aimed to:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Enrich the lifetime depression phenotype including treatment response</p></list-item><list-item><p>Investigate new disorders: panic disorder and eating disorders</p></list-item><list-item><p>Update aspects of participants&#8217; social circumstances.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Aim</title><p>This paper outlines the content of the MHQ2 questionnaire, describes the cohort, and gives an overview of participant responses. We aim to report (A) who responded to the MHQ1 and MHQ2, (B) the mental health phenotypes and social factors ascertained in MHQ2, (C) changes in the current mental health of the cohort, and (D) the consistency of lifetime phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>UK Biobank</title><p>UKB invited people aged 40&#8211;69 years living close to one of 22 assessment centres in England, Scotland, and Wales between 2006&#8211;2010 to take part. 503,309 (5.5%) agreed, and 91% remain in the cohort. Three main sources of data in UKB are: baseline assessment and samples; linkages such as hospital inpatient records; and &#8216;enhancements&#8217; such as imaging and the MHQs.</p><p>Linkage and enhancements have variable coverage and have been conducted at various timepoints, so caution is needed in the analysis and interpretation of such data, as shown in a recent timeline [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Participants in UKB differ from the wider UK population by more likely being female, having higher educational attainment, and living in areas with less deprivation, though more urban than average [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ethnicity of participants is predominantly White British, with small numbers of participants from other ethnicities [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The health and health behaviours of the UKB participants are better than average, with less smoking, lower incidence of cancer and lower mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>UKB operates inside the ethical framework of the UK Health Research Authority. Participants gave consent for their data to be used and can withdraw at any time, with an option to withdraw their existing data from future analysis. Research Ethics Committee opinion has been sought for UKB and each enhancement from the North West - Haydock Research Ethics Committee, including November 2022 (21/NW/0157, amendment 07).</p><p>UKB data can be accessed by submitting a research protocol for approval [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], subject to UKB procedures including that researchers have no ability to identify participants. Over 4,000 research proposals had been approved by January 2024. Most of the data in this paper were accessed through UKB-approved research number 82087, downloaded 23/10/2023, with withdrawals downloaded 11/06/2024. The exception was for the participation numbers, which were provided by UKB&#8217;s scientific team with a censoring date of 11/06/2024.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Questionnaire administration</title><p>UKB participants who had a valid email address on record were sent an invitation email in October to November 2022, which included a hyperlink to a personalised questionnaire. If there was no response, a reminder email was sent two weeks after the initial invitation. Respondents who started, but did not complete, the questionnaire were sent a reminder two weeks after they last accessed it. Finally, a second invitation was sent to non-responders two months after their previous one (around January 2023). All participants were also able to access the online questionnaire via the UKB participant website, as explained in annual postal newsletters (sent to people with no email address). Respondents were asked to enter their date of birth as an identity check, and the data for any respondents whose entered date of birth did not match the information previously provided are not released. We define someone as having completed the MHQ2 if they completed the mental health modules shown in <xref rid="pone.0324189.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (there was also a COVID-19 module) and their MHQ2 data was available, which excludes any participants who failed the identity check or withdrew their data between answering the questionnaire and our data access.

For each module or group of modules, small groups of MHO members with expertise in those subjects produced algorithms to derive these phenotypes from questionnaire responses. These were then checked and edited to create a consistent style and circulated to the whole consortium for comments.

Lastly, an over-arching script was created that brought the code from all the modules&#8217; subgroups together, including a final few definitions that required responses from multiple modules.

However, when we use questionnaires, we are unable to take wider issues into account. The criteria we use for the &#8220;lifetime depression&#8221; phenotype, for example, are therefore referred to as quasi-diagnostic because they are informed by diagnostic criteria, but fail to fully examine a participant. When we refer to a group with &#8220;lifetime depression&#8221;, we mean only that they met the criteria for lifetime depression on our measure, not that they were fully assessed.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Analysis</title><p>We planned a descriptive summary of the questionnaire respondents and responses. We refer to the proportion of cases in the respondents.

The 2016 MHQ1 wave and the full original UKB cohort are presented for comparison. The age variable was handled differently for the three groups. Age for the MHQ2 wave was their age on completion of the MHQ2, and for the MHQ1 wave age at completion of MHQ1. For the UKB cohort as a whole, age represents the age they would have been at the median date of MHQ2 completion, including those who died before this date, excluding those with missing baseline data (n&#8201;=&#8201;2).</p></list-item><list-item><p>B: Mental Health Phenotypes and Social Factors</p></list-item><list-item><p>We present numbers with lifetime mental health disorders in MHQ2 and describe the personal characteristics in the groups responding to different mental health disorders.

Participants are defined as having current mental disorder if they meet case criteria according to PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety) and AUDIT (harmful alcohol use). These are analysed in age-group and sex-stratified blacks, and plotted as line graphs for each disorder, showing the proportion positive by age-group for each sex and each wave. Age groups in seven-year blocks, which reflects the amount of time between the two waves, such that most participants move one age block between MHQ1 and MHQ2, although not exact. Relative risk for 2022 compared to 2016 was calculated by using &#8216;proportion positive&#8217; as the risk of disorder in each cohort and then risk in 2022 by that in 2016. This is done in age-and-sex stratified groups such that those aged, for example, 73&#8211;79 years in 2016 are compared with those aged 73&#8211;79 in 2022 for the four age groups where possible and also for the cohort overall.</p></list-item><list-item><p>D: Consistency of lifetime phenotypes</p></list-item><list-item><p>We compare &#8216;lifetime status&#8217; in 2022 compared to 2016 in those who completed both waves, to give test-retest stability. Status for each participant was meeting case criteria for depression ever (CIDI-SF lifetime), bipolar ever (adapted CIDI), self-harm ever (self-report), cannabis ever (self-report) and any clinician diagnosis (self-report). Percentage agreement for each status was calculated as status agreeing in 2016 and 2022 (both positive or both negative) as a proportion of the cohort, and Cohen&#8217;s kappa for each status, with kappa being agreement corrected for agreement by chance [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Where a respondent was negative in 2016 but positive in 2022, we also took into account the date that the respondent gave for onset in MHQ2 (except for clinician diagnosis, where this was not asked). This helps separate these respondents into those whose status could have been picked up in the MHQ1 wave (date of onset from MHQ2 was before 2016), from those who might not have done (either date of onset after start of 2016 or answered &#8216;don&#8217;t know&#8217; to date of onset). We decided to include unknown with the later onsets, despite no information to suggest these are more likely to be late onset, to explain the greatest amount of test-retest variability.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Sample</title><p>Data provided by UKB&#8217;s scientific team showed that, after accounting for deaths and withdrawals, 457,653 participants were eligible to complete the MHQ2 (<xref rid="pone.0324189.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

Self-reported clinician diagnosis of panic disorder appears to be much lower (0.2%) than the symptom-based definition (4.0%), although 4.5% reported a clinician diagnosis of a panic <italic toggle="yes">attack</italic>. For context, in the MHQ1, the symptom-based definition of lifetime generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) was met by 7%.</p><p>Within the eating disorders category were four specific disorders, and respondents could fall into more than one in their lifetime. Anorexia nervosa criteria were met by 1.7% of respondents, purging disorder by 0.9%, bulimia nervosa by 0.4%, and binge-eating disorder by 0.2%. This can be compared to self-report of an eating disorder diagnosis, for example, self-report of anorexia nervosa was 0.5%.</p><p>The proportion with any lifetime disorder (symptom-based definition) may be patterned by age, ethnicity and sex. Lifetime disorder appears to be higher in younger age (45&#8211;64: 34%), higher in those of Mixed ethnicity at 30%, than White (21%) or Asian (15%); higher in female (27%) than male (14%).

The group of respondents that met the criteria for eating disorders and panic disorder appear to have similar characteristics to those respondents with depression and bipolar, although it was remarkable that over half of those with lifetime eating disorders had a degree qualification (53%).</p><p>Adverse events in childhood were reported by 42% and adverse events in their adult life by 22%.

This rating was an average of 88 for people with no lifetime criteria, 80 for those with depression and eating disorder history, 75 for those with panic disorder and 70 for those with bipolar disorder.

The criteria for positive status were the same in both questionnaires. Across these phenotypes, respondents seem more likely to meet the criteria in MHQ1 than in MHQ2, except for self-harm. Kappa values for the two symptom-based definitions are depression 0.53 and bipolar 0.30, with values being higher in the other categories (any clinician diagnosis 0.66, self-harm 0.67, cannabis 0.81). A potential cause of lack of agreement between the questionnaire waves are cases that started after completing MHQ1. Looking at depression, of those 5,947 who were positive in MHQ2 but not MHQ1, at least 4,445 (75%) had an onset before the MHQ1 wave, so could have been detected then. For self-harm 77%, bipolar 90% and cannabis 93% of those who were negative in MHQ1 could have been detected according to self-reported onset, therefore new-onset can explain only a small amount of discordant cases. <xref rid="pone.0324189.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0324189.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Tables</xref> in S1 File show the sex-stratified results, and they are similar; for example, self-harm reporting in women had a kappa of 0.68, and in men 0.65.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0324189.t004" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324189.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of lifetime phenotype status in MHQ1 and MHQ2 in those participants who completed both questionnaires (n&#8201;=&#8201;111,275).

The original MHQ was one of the largest mental health surveys ever reported. This second wave gives an even larger sample size, more detail, and coverage of broader aspects of mental health. Responses from 169,253 UK Biobank participants are available for the MHQ2, which brings to 215,252 the number who have at least one wave of the mental health questionnaire that can be analysed. We have selected a few notable features to describe, which we hope will stimulate interest in this resource. These were: (A) who responded to the MHQ2; (B) the mental health phenotypes and social factors; (C) changes in the mental health of the cohort; and (D) the consistency of lifetime phenotypes.</p><p>Respondents: There was a substantial overlap of participants who completed the previous wave, and participant characteristics of the two waves were similar. As shown in the previous paper [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the biases in completion of the mental health questionnaires resembled and amplified the biases in recruitment to UKB. The respondents to MHQ2 appeared less likely to be deprived or have a chronic illness than the overall UKB cohort, and 97% were from a White ethnic group.</p><p>Mental health and social factors: Depression was the most common lifetime disorder at 18% in the MHQ2 wave, although it was 24% in the MHQ1 wave. Next in this questionnaire was panic disorder (4.0%), eating disorder (2.8%) and bipolar type I (0.4%). The pattern of social and health characteristics appear to be different for people who met criteria for any of those four disorders, including suggestions of increased adverse child events, more difficult and deprived personal circumstances, and poorer health. This pattern seems more pronounced with rarer disorders. If those people in UK Biobank with a history of mental health disorder or disorders had worse self-rated health, this can be due to health being poorer both because of the mental disorders themselves or because they are at greater risk of developing physical illness or, conversely, due to them having a physical disorder that places them at higher risk of developing a mental disorder [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. UK Biobank is a valuable data source for studying these issues, and repeated measures to give longitudinal data will help.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Repeated measures</title><p>Current mental health: In the MHQ1 wave, both lifetime and current mental health disorders appeared to be rarer in old age. This could be an age effect (mental health gets better as people age) or a cohort effect (people born earlier have better mental health). Using repeated current mental disorder scales, the frequency of alcohol use disorder appeared to decrease between MHQ1 and MHQ2 (six years), suggesting an age effect. For depression and anxiety, the frequency appeared to be nearly unchanged as the cohort aged, suggesting a cohort effect. Another possibility is that 2022 was an era of higher anxiety and depression due to the COVID pandemic and knock-on effects, for example, prolonged health service disruption, which may make it difficult for any age-related improvement in mental health to be demonstrated at this time. The short-term deviation of mental distress from the COVID pandemic has been well-documented (for example,[<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]), but the long-term mental health outcomes of the period are still unknown [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and may merit monitoring. There are already some measures that can be examined longitudinally, for instance, selected questions from the PHQ-9 were asked at baseline and in several enhancements (sleep, cognitive testing, imaging visits, MHQ1 and MHQ2) and the EQ-5D-5L (health-related quality of life) reported here from MHQ2 was also asked in the UKB pain questionnaire in 2019, and in the pain 2 questionnaire in 2024.</p><p>Lifetime phenotypes: We investigated the test-retest consistency for phenotypes that we would expect to be similar between waves: lifetime depression, bipolar affective disorder type I, self-harm, cannabis use and self-report of any clinician diagnosis. In all cases, there was high agreement on phenotype status (from 84% for depression to 99% for bipolar), although kappa (which corrects for agreement by chance) revealed that lifetime depression and lifetime bipolar statuses were somewhat inconsistent (0.53 for depression, 0.30 for bipolar), and this was not accounted for by new-onset. To meet criteria for depression and bipolar, several criteria needed to be met, frequently hinging on a dichotomous scoring of a Likert-like scale. For instance, for the question &#8220;In your worst ever episode&#8230; How much did these problems interfere with your life or activities? &#8211; A lot/ Somewhat/ A little/ Not at all&#8221;, an answer of &#8220;A lot&#8221; or &#8220;Somewhat&#8221; would support a depression status, but &#8220;A little&#8221; would rule it out. We can speculate that a person&#8217;s appraisal could change from &#8220;Somewhat&#8221; to &#8220;A little&#8221; over time, perhaps to a more positive interpretation as they age, or that the worst episode they were thinking about in 2016 was different in this respect from the one they were thinking about in 2022. Therefore, a change in status according from criteria may occur with only modest changes in reporting. To meet the criteria for bipolar, participants had to meet criteria for both depression and mania. The definition for ever self-harm and cannabis consisted of a few yes/no questions. For yes/no questions, and when talking about behaviours rather than feelings, there would be less reappraisal. It is not clear why the recall of self-report clinician diagnosis might be inconsistent, perhaps it hinges on recall of whether a disorder was diagnosed, rather than merely discussed or mentioned. These inconsistencies may complicate the interpretation of some of these outcomes, but it is possible they reflect the underlying uncertain boundaries between health and disorder [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>UK Biobank is a valuable resource for investigating mental health, but it also presents challenges. The cohort consists of a convenience sample, and the non-representativeness observed at baseline assessments is exacerbated in the voluntary enhancements (such as the MHQs). The multiple enhancements with different samples and timings can complicate planning and interpreting analyses. We can speculate that people with poorer health, including mental health, would be less likely to start a UK Biobank questionnaire, or may have not been able to complete (6,000 people or 3% of those that started did not complete). Because of non-representativeness, researchers should not make population inferences based solely on UK Biobank data. We have not tested what effect the non-representativeness of the sample has had on our ascertainment of mental disorders and the pattern with social factors.</p><p>We have designed the UKB MHQ1 and MHQ2 with researchers familiar with large cohorts and clinical academics &#8211; leading to the use of widely accepted measures and clinically relevant outcomes. The completion of the questionnaire was also high once started, assisted by reminder emails. However, the MHQs are reliant on self-report, frequently of an episode of psychopathology that may have been many years ago. This may result in some inconsistencies, such as seen in the test-retest statistics &#8211; which we suggest is due to inconsistent recall and indistinct boundaries in mental disorders, which have no diagnostic tests.</p><p>Our approach to developing this paper and facilitating further research using MHQ2 has incorporated quality assurance processes when developing algorithms and code, which we are sharing with the wider research community. We enhance transparency by sharing resources, however, errors are still inevitable in such projects [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] so we encourage caution when using these resources, and feedback from others if they suspect any problems. This paper is just the beginning, which we hope will encourage other researchers to investigate more deeply. Further advice for people considering using UKB for mental health research is available in a recent review paper [<xref rid="pone.0324189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mental health questionnaires enhance UKB with large amounts of data on common mental disorders (particularly depression), and also on disorders that have not received much research in an older population, such as panic disorder and eating disorders, and update social factors a decade after baseline. Importantly, the UKB now has included transdiagnostic symptoms (self-harm, body weight/shape preoccupation in MHQ2, psychotic experiences in MHQ1) and psychological constructs (resilience, loneliness and neuroticism) that are infrequently or never available from clinical data. Repeated measures for items such as depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life, along with linkage to routine health data for follow-up, allow longitudinal and causal analyses. UKB offers a large sample size, extensive genetic information, biomarkers and imaging data, alongside detailed mental health data, which we hope will be used to help us understand more about mental health, and how we might prevent and treat poor mental health in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material

First, they explain the question changes from MHQ1 to MHQ2. Then they evaluate many characteristics of MHQ2, including comparisons between MHQ1 and MHQ2. This work not only provides a useful understanding of the mental health progression of the UKB participants, but it also provides a useful test-retest evaluation of the lifetime prevalence measures of the UKB.</p><p>Overall thoughts: This study is an exciting contribution to the field that will allow many researchers to expand their investigation of mental health in the UK Biobank. Their explanation of the differences in questions, participant overlap, and demographics between MHQ1 and MHQ2 are clear and valuable to the field. The figures are nice and effectively convey the information they intend to. Their analytical evaluation of MHQ2 however could be improved by further methodological explanation and potentially increased statistical rigor. Some analyses are performed with minimal explanation and some comparison results have no stated statistical analyses where the authors may wish to include them. With that said, the comparisons they provided are useful and important for researchers of the field to see. Therefore, I excitedly endorse its acceptance at PLOS ONE after minor revisions.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Methodological clarity would be improved if the sections in the Methods that explain the analyses/comparisons of results were more clearly linked. For example using 1, 2, 3/A, B, C/or identical headers to link the method and its associated result.</p><p>2. Many methods, particularly analyses, do not seem to be seem to be explained in detail anywhere in the paper or supplement. This not only often leaves the reader with confusion about what analysis was done but also how to evaluate the results. Relatedly, many tables seem to include statistical quantifications that are not explained in the paper or table legend.</p><p>a. For example, please elaborate on how relative risk for depression and anxiety, stated in line 376, were</p><p>calculated. The authors state that the relative risk for these disorders are approximately the same, was this</p><p>determined using statistical analysis?</p><p>b. For example, details of the evaluation of lifetime diagnosis between MHQ1 and MHQ2, and its associated Table</p><p>4, are unclear. Particularly, the line &#8220;after taking into account onsets after MHQ1 (including unknown onsets),</p><p>between 75% to 93% of the test-retest variation in direction &#8216;Met 2 not 1&#8217; and all in direction &#8216;Met 1 not 2&#8217;</p><p>remains unexplained&#8221; should be improved for clarity. Please explain how unknown onsets are incorporated (I assume the authors included any unknown onset into &#8216;onsets after MHQ1&#8217; which seems an odd choice because it is not clear why these unknown onsets would be more likely to occur after MHQ1 as opposed to before). Additionally, how is test-retest variation determined and what does 75%-93% variation mean for this finding? What indicates that this variation is unexplained? Table 4, which relates to this result, could also be improved by further elaboration. What does the &#8220;Agree (%)&#8221; column refer to? The column &#8220;New onset (% Met 2 not 1)&#8221; should also explicitly state in the legend that this is the percent of individuals in the Met 2 not 1 group that reported new onset since MHQ1. Please also explain how new onset was determined.</p><p>3. The results include many comparisons between quantitative measures, but do not state a statistical difference. For example, starting on line 343, &#8220;those with lifetime eating disorders are more likely to have a degree qualification (eating disorder 53%; depression 46%; no mental disorder 44%)&#8221; compares the degree qualification of these 3 groups but not does indicate if these groups are statistically different. I recognize that this work is intended more as a descriptor for the new MHQ2, but I would refrain from drawing conclusions about these comparisons without statistical analysis. I recommend either including this statistical analysis or dampening claims about such comparisons throughout the paper.</p><p>4. For the methodological explanation starting at line 256, &#8220;Age at MHQ2&#8230;&#8221;, why was age of participants who did not complete MHQ2 included in the average age calculated for MHQ2? I assume that this age calculation is used in the demographics comparison table, which seems problematic as this does not accurately reflect the age of the MHQ2 participants to my mind. Though perhaps I misunderstand the explanation of this methodology, in which case I recommend improving the clarity of writing for this section.</p><p>5. I recognized that criteria for lifetime status is unchanged from MHQ1, but it may be of value to restate these criteria in this work.</p><p>6. I assume &#8220;dx&#8221; in Table 3 is short for diagnosis. Please include this abbreviation in the table legend.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This manuscript describes the procedure and content of the UK Biobank (UKB) MHQ2 questionnaire, provides a general cohort description, and presents overall comparisons between the two mental health data collections in UKB. The authors report a significant enhancement to the UKB resource by conducting a second mental health data collection in 169,253 individuals, bringing the total number of UKB participants with mental health data from at least one time point to 215,252, and those with data from two time points to 111,275. This represents a major advancement for the UKB mental health phenotypes and is an important contribution to the research field.</p><p>The manuscript clearly outlines the rationale and procedural decisions made during the design phase. The authors describe the characteristics of participants across the two waves and the broader UKB cohort, as well as across symptom-based criteria for lifetime disorders. They also examine changes in mental health using &#8216;current&#8217; assessments and assess the consistency of measures using &#8216;lifetime&#8217; assessments.</p><p>Comments and suggestions</p><p>1. It appears that the authors defined participants based on completion of all questionnaire modules. Given the difference between the number of individuals who started (175,266) and those who completed (169,252), 6,014 individuals did not finish the questionnaire. Inability to complete the full questionnaire may be linked to more severe mental health conditions, such as difficulties with concentration, fatigue, or other relevant health issues. The responses provided by these individuals before discontinuation could still be valuable for analyzing MHQ2 data. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify their decision to exclude these individuals in this context.</p><p>2. If data on completion times are available, it would be informative to include basic descriptive statistics on the time required to complete the full questionnaire. This would help estimate the time investment expected from participants.</p><p>3. Is it possible to determine whether the worst episodes described in detail in MHQ1 and MHQ2 refers to the same episode or two different episodes? This distinction would be useful both for assessing changes in symptoms across different episodes and for evaluating recall inconsistency for symptoms of the same episode. As the questionnaire does not seem to ask about the age at which the worst episode occurred, making this distinction may be challenging. Clarification on this point would be valuable.</p><p>4. It is unclear why psychotic experiences were omitted from MHQ2. While balancing questionnaire length and topic coverage is important, multiple assessments of psychotic symptoms could be highly relevant for investigating their links to, for example, cannabis use, medication use, or changes over the second half of the lifespan. Related to this, the wording in lines 502&#8211;504 of the Conclusions section may unintentionally suggest that psychotic experiences were included in this data collection. Rewording this sentence for clarity is recommended.</p><p>5. There appears to be a minor inconsistency in the reported sample size. The abstract and Tables 2 and 3 state that the number of respondents was 169,253, while the Results section (line 276) and Figure 2 state 169,252. It would be helpful to double-check and ensure consistency across the manuscript.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Methodological clarity would be improved if the sections in the Methods that explain the analyses/comparisons of results were more clearly linked. For example using 1, 2, 3/A, B, C/or identical headers to link the method and its associated result.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We have now lettered our aims, and used these to structure the analysis section and results. We aim to report (A) who responded to the MHQ1 and MHQ2, (B) the mental health phenotypes and social factors ascertained in MHQ2, (C) changes in the current mental health of the cohort, and (D) the consistency of lifetime phenotypes.</p><p>2. Many methods, particularly analyses, do not seem to be seem to be explained in detail anywhere in the paper or supplement. This not only often leaves the reader with confusion about what analysis was done but also how to evaluate the results. Relatedly, many tables seem to include statistical quantifications that are not explained in the paper or table legend.</p><p>Response: We have rewritten the analysis section to be sure that it describes those analyses that follow.</p><p>a. For example, please elaborate on how relative risk for depression and anxiety, stated in line 376, were calculated.</p><p>Response: Thank you for highlighting this. We now state in the analysis section that:</p><p>&#8220;Changes in Current Mental Health: We describe and visualise the proportion of respondents who were positive for specified current mental disorders in 2022 and in 2016 in those participants who answered in both waves&#8230; Relative risk for 2022 compared to 2016 was calculated by using &#8216;proportion positive&#8217; as the risk of disorder in each cohort and then risk in 2022 by that in 2016. This is done in age-and-sex stratified groups such that those aged, for example, 73-79 years in 2016 are compared with those aged 73-79 in 2022 for the four age groups where possible and also for the cohort overall.&#8221;</p><p>The authors state that the relative risk for these disorders are approximately the same, was this determined using statistical analysis?</p><p>Thank you, the answer is no. We agree that this may have sounded as though we were making a formal comparison where we had not intended to do so. We have clarified in the methods: &#8220;Significance testing on large cohorts may identify many small differences between comparators that have very little effect (35), therefore we have emphasised the magnitude of difference rather than calculating p-values.&#8221;</p><p>We have also rephrased this section for greater clarity:</p><p>&#8220;Supplementary Table 4 quantifies this a little more by reporting the relative risk of each current mental disorder in 2022 versus 2016 in each sex and age-group stratification and overall. A relative risk of 1 would suggest no change of risk in the group for the current disorder in 2022 compared to 2016 wave, with values above 1 suggesting a higher risk in 2022. The relative risk for every sex and age-group stratified group was above 1, between 1.07 and 2.00, with the latter representing a doubling of the presence of current depression in women aged 73 to 79 in 2022 compared to 2016. Despite age-group stratified relative risks being above 1, the relative risk for the whole cohort are close to 1 for depression (1.07) and anxiety (0.98), suggesting little change between 2016 and 2022, or below 1 for alcohol use disorder (0.84), due to the gradient of fewer cases in older age groups.&#8221;</p><p>b. For example, details of the evaluation of lifetime diagnosis between MHQ1 and MHQ2, and its associated Table 4, are unclear. Particularly, the line &#8220;after taking into account onsets after MHQ1 (including unknown onsets), between 75% to 93% of the test-retest variation in direction &#8216;Met 2 not 1&#8217; and all in direction &#8216;Met 1 not 2&#8217; remains unexplained&#8221; should be improved for clarity.</p><p>Please explain how unknown onsets are incorporated (I assume the authors included any unknown onset into &#8216;onsets after MHQ1&#8217; which seems an odd choice because it is not clear why these unknown onsets would be more likely to occur after MHQ1 as opposed to before). Additionally, how is test-retest variation determined and what does 75%-93% variation mean for this finding? What indicates that this variation is unexplained? Table 4, which relates to this result, could also be improved by further elaboration. What does the &#8220;Agree (%)&#8221; column refer to? The column &#8220;New onset (% Met 2 not 1)&#8221; should also explicitly state in the legend that this is the percent of individuals in the Met 2 not 1 group that reported new onset since MHQ1. Please also explain how new onset was determined.</p><p>Response: We agree that our description of onset timing and discrepancy of findings was not clear. Regarding new-onset, we knew that readers would want to know how much of the discrepancy between MHQ1 and MHQ2 were due to this, so we extracted data to distinguish between those that should have been picked up by MHQ1 from those we were less sure or knew could not have been picked up. Although we cannot know the onset when respondents marked &#8217;don&#8217;t know&#8217;, we included them along with documented recent onset in order to give the proportion that definitely could have been detected at MHQ1 if a true disorder. For clarity, we now only report those figures: of those that were negative in MHQ1 and positive in MHQ2, the proportion that, from their date of onset, also had the disorder at the time of the MHQ1. This meant losing a small section in the discussion that was about the magnitude of new-onset cases that, on reflection, was speculative and not part of our aims.</p><p>We have made changes to the analysis description in the methods, results section and table, which we hope explain more of our intentions and findings.</p><p>In methods we have written:</p><p>&#8220;D: Consistency of lifetime phenotypes&#8230;. Percentage agreement for each status was calculated as status agreeing in 2016 and 2022 (both positive or both negative) as a proportion of the cohort, and Cohen&#8217;s kappa for each status, with kappa being agreement corrected for agreement by chance(38). Where a respondent was negative in 2016 but positive in 2022, we also took into account the date that the respondent gave for onset in MHQ2 (except for clinician diagnosis, where this was not asked). This helps separate these respondents into those whose status could have been picked up in the MHQ1 wave (date of onset from MHQ2 was before 2016), from those who might not have done (either date of onset after start of 2016 or answered &#8216;don&#8217;t know&#8217; to date of onset). We decided to include unknown with the later onsets, despite no information to suggest these are more likely to be late onset, to explain the greatest amount of test-retest variability.&#8221;</p><p>In results we have written:</p><p>&#8220;A potential cause of lack of agreement between the questionnaire waves are new-onset cases that started after completing MHQ1. Of those 5,947 who were positive in MHQ2 but not MHQ1 for depression, 4,445 (75%) reported an onset before the MHQ1 wave, so could have been detected then. For self-harm 77%, bipolar 90% and cannabis 93% of those who were negative in MHQ1 could have been detected according to self-reported onset, therefore new-onset explains only a small amount of discordant cases.&#8221;</p><p>For the table, we have added some additional label rows, so that rather than a column being labelled &#8220;Met 1 not 2&#8221; it is labelled as &#8216;Positive&#8217; in the MHQ1 status row, &#8216;Negative&#8217; in the MHQ2 row, and so on, as we think this will be more intuitive. We have also put the denominator into the cells for clarity. The legend has been changed to: &#8220;Comparison of lifetime phenotype status in MHQ1 and MHQ2 in those participants who completed both questionnaires (n=111,275). Percentage is proportion of those participants in each agreement category, except last column. Last column takes into account the date of onset in lack of agreement, percentage is proportion with onset prior to 2016 (approximate date of MHQ1).&#8221; And with a footnote &#8220;*date of onset (of depression, bipolar, self-harm or cannabis use) was reported in MHQ2 to be before MHQ1 wave, rather than onset that was definitely after MHQ1 wave or was unknown.&#8221;</p><p>3. The results include many comparisons between quantitative measures, but do not state a statistical difference. For example, starting on line 343, &#8220;those with lifetime eating disorders are more likely to have a degree qualification (eating disorder 53%; depression 46%; no mental disorder 44%)&#8221; compares the degree qualification of these 3 groups but not does indicate if these groups are statistically different. I recognize that this work is intended more as a descriptor for the new MHQ2, but I would refrain from drawing conclusions about these comparisons without statistical analysis. I recommend either including this statistical analysis or dampening claims about such comparisons throughout the paper.</p><p>Response: Thank you. It is true that we wish to be mainly descriptive. Another reason for being reluctant to include significance testing is that the large sample size means that many comparisons will be statistically significant. Therefore, we have stated in the analysis plan: &#8220;Significance testing on large cohorts may identify many small differences between comparators that have very little effect (35), therefore we have emphasised the magnitude of difference rather than calculating p-values.&#8221; We have made minor changes to the results sections to avoid implying we have made formal comparisons. For the result mentioned above, we have changed this to read:</p><p>&#8220;The group of respondents that met the criteria for eating disorders and panic disorder appear to have similar characteristics to those respondents with depression and bipolar, although it was remarkable that over half of those with lifetime eating disorders had a degree qualification (53%).&#8221;</p><p>4. For the methodological explanation starting at line 256, &#8220;Age at MHQ2&#8230;&#8221;, why was age of participants who did not complete MHQ2 included in the average age calculated for MHQ2? I assume that this age calculation is used in the demographics comparison table, which seems problematic as this does not accurately reflect the age of the MHQ2 participants to my mind. Though perhaps I misunderstand the explanation of this methodology, in which case I recommend improving the clarity of writing for this section.</p><p>Response: Thank you, we hope we have now provided more clarity on this. For the group that answered the MHQ2, their age is taken as when they completed the questionnaire, and this is what is presented in table 2 in the MHQ2 column. Our dilemma was that most in the full cohort did not complete the questionnaire, so we had to find an equivalent point in order to compare the MHQ2 respondents with the base cohort, which we decided was the median data of completion of the MHQ2. We then applied this to everyone (regardless of whether had completed MHQ2 or not), and that is what is presented in table 2 in the UK Biobank cohort column.</p><p>After revisions, in the methods section we say:</p><p>&#8220;The age variable was handled differently for the three groups. Age for the MHQ2 wave was their age on completion of the MHQ2, and for the MHQ1 wave age at completion of MHQ1. For the UKB cohort as a whole, age represents the age they would have been at the median date of MHQ2 completion, including those who died before this date&#8221;</p><p>In the footnote to table 2 we say:</p><p>&#8220;Age in the MHQ2 wave is at date of completion of MHQ2. Age in the MHQ1 wave is at approximate date of completion of MHQ1. Age for full cohort is the age a participant would have been on the median date of MHQ2 completion.&#8221;</p><p>5. I recognized that criteria for lifetime status is unchanged from MHQ1, but it may be of value to restate these criteria in this work.</p><p>Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have added :</p><p>&#8220;The criteria for positive status were the same in both questionnaires.&#8221;</p><p>6. I assume &#8220;dx&#8221; in Table 3 is short for diagnosis. Please include this abbreviation in the table legend.</p><p>Response: Thanks, added.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript describes the procedure and content of the UK Biobank (UKB) MHQ2 questionnaire, provides a general cohort description, and presents overall comparisons between the two mental health data collections in UKB. The authors report a significant enhancement to the UKB resource by conducting a second mental health data collection in 169,253 individuals, bringing the total number of UKB participants with mental health data from at least one time point to 215,252, and those with data from two time points to 111,275. This represents a major advancement for the UKB mental health phenotypes and is an important contribution to the research field.</p><p>The manuscript clearly outlines the rationale and procedural decisions made during the design phase. The authors describe the characteristics of participants across the two waves and the broader UKB cohort, as well as across symptom-based criteria for lifetime disorders. They also examine changes in mental health using &#8216;current&#8217; assessments and assess the consistency of measures using &#8216;lifetime&#8217; assessments.</p><p>Comments and suggestions</p><p>1. It appears that the authors defined participants based on completion of all questionnaire modules. Given the difference between the number of individuals who started (175,266) and those who completed (169,252), 6,014 individuals did not finish the questionnaire. Inability to complete the full questionnaire may be linked to more severe mental health conditions, such as difficulties with concentration, fatigue, or other relevant health issues. The responses provided by these individuals before discontinuation could still be valuable for analyzing MHQ2 data. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify their decision to exclude these individuals in this context.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We agree there is good reason to think that there may be a systematic bias against the very people who would be cases had they completed the questionnaire. However, in the absence of being able to test this, we are not able to comment on this. It may be helpful to know that the data is available on these people for all of the sections that they managed to fill out, but for the sake of simplicity in this report (different ns for different disorders etc.), we have omitted them.</p><p>In the strengths and limitations section we have written: &#8220;We can speculate that people with poorer health, including mental health, would be less likely to start a UK Biobank questionnaire, or may have not been able to complete (as around 6,000 people or 3% of those that started).&#8221;</p><p>2. If data on completion times are available, it would be informative to include basic descriptive statistics on the time required to complete the full questionnaire. This would help estimate the time investment expected from participants.</p><p>Response: We see that this would be useful. Unfortunately, we do not have this in any form that would be robust enough to quote.
