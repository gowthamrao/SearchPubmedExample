Analysis of the Drug Abuse Warning Data found that emergency room visits for alcohol-involved drug OD visits doubled between 2005 and 2011.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Nearly 60% of these cases included the use of central nervous system medications, with approximately half of these being opioid or benzodiazepine medications. Jones, Paulozzi, and Mack<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> found that nearly 20% of opioid medication ODs and nearly 30% of benzodiazepine ODs involved alcohol. Similarly, 22% of the opiate OD deaths and 21% of the benzodiazepine deaths involved alcohol. More recently, research has shown that from 2000 through 2019, deaths from alcohol poisonings doubled, and deaths from combined alcohol and opioid ODs more than quadrupled.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> By 2017, alcohol was a contributing factor in approximately 15% of all opioid OD deaths.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> While these findings pertain to acute alcohol and opioid use, they suggest a potential relationship between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD/OD).</p><p>Research has also shown that both hazardous alcohol consumption and AUD are associated with the non-medical use of prescription opioids among college students.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Similarly, Schepis and McCabe<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> found that AUD was related to opioid misuse in a sample of adults aged 50 and above. Schepis and Hake<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, using the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), reported that participants with a previous AUD were more likely to have an OUD/OD than those without an AUD. Moreover, Weitzman and Ong<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> found that the overlap between AUD and OUD/OD grew substantially between 2008 and 2015 and argued for research addressing the prospective relationship between these two disorders.</p><p>Given its predictive value, individuals with an AUD represent a potentially important population for preventing the development of OUD/OD. However, the value and nature of any intervention to reduce the likelihood of an OUD/OD may depend on the temporal aspects of the progression&#8212;that is, whether an individual identified with an AUD is likely to develop an OUD/OD rapidly or more gradually. The unfolding of the opioid epidemic has been characterized as three waves corresponding to the primary opioid involved in fatal ODs, prescription opioids (2007&#8211;2009), heroin (2010&#8211;2012), and fentanyl (2013&#8211;2016).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> From the year of our first full cohort, 2007, until 2009, the opioid overdose epidemic was largely an issue of prescription opioids. Beginning in 2010, there was a growth in heroin ODs which continued to increase until approximately 2016. However, beginning in 2013, there was a rapid increase in OD deaths due to fentanyl which continued in 2016 and increased dramatically after 2016. Unfortunately, there are few longitudinal studies of the development of OUD/OD that specifically examine the role of AUD nor examine how this relationship may have changed over the three waves of the epidemic.</p><p>One of the important changes in the development of OUD/OD over the three waves of the opioid epidemic has been the relationship between OUD/OD and the social determinants of health. For example, early in the epidemic, fatal ODs were more likely in the white non-Hispanic population and increased rapidly from 1999 through 2012 in this group.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Beginning in 2013, the fatal OD rates among the African-American population began to increase, with large increases due to heroin and fentanyl and increases due to prescription opioids in 2016.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Rapid increases were also observed among Hispanic individuals.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition to racial/ethnic disparities, there were substantial disparities with respect to education<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and gender.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Finally, although the early wave of prescription opioid ODs was more pronounced in rural areas, the subsequent heroin and fentanyl waves were stronger in urban areas.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and timing of OUD or OD among clients seeking treatment for an alcohol use problem over a ten-year period (2007&#8211;2016) and to determine whether the prevalence changed over the three waves of the opioid epidemic. In addition, we examine whether social determinants of health were related to the occurrence of an OUD/OD and whether these changed over the waves. This was accomplished by utilizing a large New York State (NYS) database of clients seeking help for the first time for an alcohol use problem and linking these data to Medicaid data for subsequent OUD/OD diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Sample</title><p>Because this study involves de-identified secondary data analyses, it was ruled exempt by the University at Buffalo Institutional Review Board and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data for this study was drawn from the Client Data System (CDS) of the NYS Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) and NYS Medicaid Data Warehouse (MDW). Clients with a first admission to an OASAS outpatient treatment program from 2007 through 2016 were included if they presented with a primary alcohol use problem (diagnoses are not recorded in the CDS) at the time of admission. Clients who reported any problem with heroin or other opioids at admission or at discharge were excluded, as were clients who were noted as receiving buprenorphine or methadone, or who were referred to an opioid treatment program after admission. OASAS staff matched and merged OASAS treatment data with the Medicaid data using a &#8220;unique client identifier&#8221; to anonymously track clients. Clients with no Medicaid records after the initial alcohol use admission were excluded as were clients with a diagnosis of OUD or OD in the Medicaid records preceding their initial alcohol admission. For this study, we only included clients who, according to the OASAS CDS, were seen in an outpatient clinic and who denied any previous treatment to provide an estimate of the risk of OUD/OD among patients seen for AUD in the earliest stages possible given these data.

Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival curves were plotted for the three opioid epidemic cohorts, and the Log rank test was performed. To analyze the associations between the diagnosis of OUD/OD and sociodemographic factors, we first employed models that included the cohort variable and each sociodemographic factor individually. Covariates that showed a statistically significant association with the diagnosis of OUD/OD were then included in a multivariable logistic regression model, from which odds ratios were derived. The main effects were examined in a multivariate model including all social determinants as well as cohort. Additionally, interaction effects were assessed in a multivariate model comprising the cohort, all the social determinant variables, and their interactions with the cohort to ascertain potential relationship changes over time. All analyses were performed using R 3.6, with a two-sided p-value of &#8804;0.05 considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Results</title><p>From the preliminary analyses, the prevalence of OD and OUD were 1.4% and 17.0% over the entire observation period. In addition, nearly everyone who experienced an OD also had a diagnosis of OUD (89.5%), although there were many clients with an OUD who did not experience an OD (92.5%). This led us to focus our analyses on the development of an OUD or an opioid OD, which we will refer to as OUD/OD.</p><p>Given the escalation in opioid ODs over the years of this study, we examined the prevalence and time to develop OUD/ODs over the time period. From the year of our first full cohort, 2007, until 2009, the opioid OD epidemic was largely an issue of prescription opioids. Our second cohort was defined as beginning in 2010 when there was a growth in heroin ODs until 2012, although deaths from heroin continued to increase after 2012. The final cohort was defined as beginning in 2013 because of the rapid increase in OD deaths due to fentanyl which began then and continued throughout 2016.</p><p>We utilized the Kaplan&#8211;Meier method to generate a cumulative hazard plot illustrating the time (in months) to an incident diagnosis of OUD/OD across different OD waves, as displayed in <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. As can be seen in this figure, patients in the most recent cohort received an OUD/OD diagnosis much more rapidly than clients in the earlier cohorts (Chi-Square for Log Rank Test = 375, df = 2, p &lt; 0.001). Of note, even though clients in the most recent cohort had been observed for a much shorter period, the overall prevalence rates were very similar with 18.2%, 17.3% and 16.1% for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Given this substantial difference and the fact that clients seen in 2016 had approximately 4 years of follow-up information, we examined the predictors of receiving an OUD/OD diagnosis within 4 years of initial admission using logistic regression. The main effects were examined in a multivariate model including all social determinants as well as cohort. Subsequently, interaction effects were assessed in a multivariate model comprising the cohort, all the social determinant variables, and their interactions with the cohort to ascertain potential relationship changes over time.</p><p>The results of the main effect analysis appear in <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Every social determinant was associated with OUD/OD in the multivariate analysis. Males were at a lower risk of developing OUD/OD than females with an odds ratio of 0.78 compared to females, indicating that the odds of developing OUD/OD are 22% lower in males than in females. Notably, individuals who were 22&#8211;25 years old when admitted were at a greater risk for OUD/OD than those who were 18&#8211;21 years old, although the magnitude of this increased risk was only about 11%. Beginning at age 36, clients who were older at their first admission were at a much reduced risk of OUD/OD, approximately 20% lower with an even lower risk for those age 55 and older (47%) when they were initially admitted. White non-Hispanic individuals had the highest risk of developing OUD/OD, significantly higher than Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic and other non-Hispanic groups who had a 27&#8211;35% lower risk. There was not a significant difference in risk between those with less than an 8th-grade education and those with more education, except for those with a bachelor&#8217;s or graduate degree. Individuals holding bachelor&#8217;s or graduate degrees exhibit odds ratios of 0.63 and 0.68, respectively, implying a significant 37% and 32% lower odds of OUD/OD compared to those with less than an

unemployment, disability, and not being in the labor force, show a substantial increase in odds of OUD/OD, ranging from 32% to 68%, compared to employed individuals. Likewise, individuals dependent on public assistance/family support or without any income source face odds ratios of 1.23 and 1.19, respectively, suggesting a higher risk of OUD/OD by 23% and 19%, respectively. Finally, individuals living independently demonstrated odds ratios ranging from 1.26 to 1.66, indicating that those living dependently, homeless or in another living arrangement were 26% to 66% more likely to have an OUD/OD diagnosis. Those who indicated they were homeless at admission had a substantially higher risk (OR = 1.66) than those who were living in a dependent living situation or any other situation.</p><p>Geographically, residents of New York City, the Western region, and the Hudson Valley exhibited odds ratios of 1.38, 1.18 and 1.17, respectively, indicating 38%, 18% and 17% higher risk OUD/OD compared to the Central NYS region.</p><p>The analyses of interactions indicated that the relationship between OUD/OD with race/ethnicity, education, income source and residence did not differ across the three cohorts. However, there were significant changes for the relationship of OUD/OD with gender, age, employment and region across the three cohorts (see <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The rate of OUD/OD for each of these variables for each level of the social factors is presented in <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. As can be seen in the table, the rate of OUD/OD among men increased slightly more than the rate among women across cohorts. The rate of OUD/OD nearly tripled among those aged 51 to 55, while the rates for other groups roughly doubled from Cohort 1 to Cohort 3. The most notable aspect of the age by cohort effect was that there were notable differences among the age groups among Cohort 1 with differences between the younger and older cohorts ranging from 2% to 4%. In contrast, the differences between the younger and older age groups in cohort 3 were about 1% to 2%.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0003" orientation="portrait"><label>Table

alcohol use problem at the time of the fentanyl wave of the opioid epidemic had a more rapid progression to an OUD/OD than clients initially seen during the prescription pain and heroin waves of the epidemic. The rapid progression is obvious within the first year after treatment admission with nearly three times as many Cohort 3 clients (9.3%) being diagnosed with an OUD/OD compared to 3.5% and 5.9% of Cohort 1 and 2 clients. The more rapid development of OUD/OD continued with the largest difference observed at four years after admission.</p><p>The more rapid development of OUD/OD in Cohort 3 may not be unexpected given the well-documented increase in OD deaths<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and hospitalizations<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> occurring during the follow-up observation period of Cohort 3, 2016 to 2020. However, it is important to note that while the development of OUD/OD was more rapid among those in Cohort 3, the data suggests that all three cohorts appeared to reach a comparable asymptote at approximately 18%. This may provide a useful estimate of the percentage of Medicaid clients with an alcohol use problem who are at risk for progression to an OUD/OD. Moreover, estimates of OUD/OD based on survey data suggest that the prevalence of OUD/OD was stable and declined from 2015 to 2019.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This suggests that the overall prevalence of OUD/OD in this sample may not be increasing, although the lethality of OD continues to increase. Further follow-up of these cohorts would be necessary to establish this. In addition, the extent to which this would generalize to other alcohol treatment samples is unknown.</p><p>The social determinants of health were strongly related to the development of OUD/OD. Most of these determinants operated similarly to findings with respect to the opioid epidemic overall. For example, white non-Hispanic clients were at a higher risk than the other racial/ethnic categories, notwithstanding the more rapid increase of mortality among Hispanics.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similarly, clients with less education were at higher risk than clients with more education. Clients who were employed at the time of admission were at lower risk than all the other employment categories and those with an independent living status were at lower risk than those in a dependent (living with family) or homeless status. However, other factors were not associated with OUD/OD in a manner similar to the OD data. For example, female clients and younger clients at admission (18&#8211;35) were at higher risk for OUD/OD than were male clients and older clients (36 and older), respectively. However, opioid mortality is higher among men than women and those aged 35 to 44.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As noted above, this may reflect the fact that the factors associated with OUD/OD and opioid mortality may be different. For example, women are more likely to use opioid analgesics, while men are more likely to use heroin, which could lead to higher prevalence of OUD/OD in women and higher mortality in men.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Although there were several significant interactions that suggested that certain subgroups (males, older) increased more rapidly than their comparators, these differences were not large. Moreover, this was usually due to a group with a lower prevalence of OUD/OD among Cohort 1 having an increased prevalence among Cohort 3, which was numerically comparable to the comparators, but proportionally higher. As a result, the effects of the social determinants did not change appreciably from Cohort 1 to Cohort 3.</p><p>There are several limitations that should be considered. The identification of OUD/OD was reliant on the presence of an OUD/OD diagnosis in the Medicaid billing. Clients may have developed an OUD/OD but were not identified medically, or they may have transitioned from Medicaid. Although both probably occurred to some extent, the overall rate of OUD/OD was quite substantial, reaching approximately 18%, so it seems likely that most cases were captured by this method. It also seems unlikely that this would have substantially altered the findings with respect to cohort differences, although it might have influenced the relationships with the social factors. Second, while we have focused specifically on the progression to OUD/OD, it is likely that some in the sample developed polysubstance use problems, including the use of benzodiazepine. Because we were interested primarily in the relationship with the unfolding opioid epidemic, the consideration of these substances was beyond the scope of this paper. Third, this sample is an important one for the purposes of secondary prevention. Although the CDS did not provide AUD diagnoses, nearly 80% were diagnosed with AUD in the Medicaid data at a subsequent point. Given that they were treatment seeking, the estimates of OUD/OD may be different for individuals with an AUD who do not present for treatment, as well as for individuals who are not on Medicaid. Finally, there is evidence that we are now in a &#8220;fourth wave&#8221; insofar as fentanyl is being combined with cocaine, leading to deaths among individuals who perhaps had not used opioids. This may lead to the development of OUD/OD among an additional and new group of individuals who had not intended to use opioids. Moreover, the continued increase of fentanyl may result in a substantial increase in both ODs and OUDs. Further follow-up of this sample may be able to address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clients presenting for treatment for alcohol use problems in the third wave of the opioid epidemic were identified with an OUD/OD much more rapidly than clients in the first and second waves. At one and four years after treatment, those in Cohort 3 had twice the prevalence of those in Cohort 1. Despite the more rapid onset of OUD/OD in Cohort 3, the overall prevalence for all three cohorts appears to converge on a prevalence of approximately 18%. Social determinants were associated with the development of OUD/OD in ways that reflected OUD/OD prevalence in other populations, but in ways that differed from opioid OD mortality. Despite minor changes in the relationships over time, the relationship between the social determinants and OUD/OD was basically comparable across cohorts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from NIH NLM [T15LM012495]; NIAAA [R21AA026954 and R33AA0226954]; NIDA [K01DA056690], and NCATS [UL1TR001412].
