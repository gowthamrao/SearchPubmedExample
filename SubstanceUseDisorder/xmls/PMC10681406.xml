However, GGT is not yet recommended for all patients diagnosed with lung cancer (LC), primarily because of a lack of evidence that supports a significant frequency of identifying pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in these patients. This study characterizes GGT results in a cohort of patients with LC.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>We reviewed deidentified data for 7,788 patients with GGT (2015-2022). PGV frequencies were compared to a control cohort of unaffected individuals. GGT results were stratified by genomic ancestry, history of cancer, and PGV clinical actionability per current guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of all patients with LC, 14.9% (1,161/7,788) had PGVs. The rate was similar when restricted to patients with no cancer family history (FH) or personal history (PH) of other cancers (14.3%). PGVs were significantly enriched in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic>, and mismatch repair genes compared with controls. Patients of European (EUR) genomic ancestry had the highest PGV rate (18%) and variants of uncertain significance were significantly higher in patients of non-EUR genomic ancestry. Of the PGVs identified, 61.3% were in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes and 95% were clinically actionable.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This retrospective study shows a LC diagnosis identifies patients with a significant likelihood of having a cancer-predisposing PGV across genomic ancestries. Enrichment of PGVs in DDR genes suggests that these PGVs may contribute to LC cancer predisposition.

Although this frequency is higher than previously reported, other studies involved different methodologies and different patient populations, making cross-study comparisons problematic. For example, in a study reported by Mukherjee et al, germline PGV in high-/moderate-penetrance genes were demonstrated in 222/5,118 patients (4.3%) with metastatic NSCLC. However, in that study, only patients with paired tumor-normal tissue were included and 30% of patients had a FH of any cancer, a PH of multiple tumors, or an early age of LC diagnosis, whereas up to 71.1% of patients on this study had a reported PH of another cancer, and advanced stage of their LCs was not required. The frequency of each of those PGVs identified was also less in the study by Mukherjee et al<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>: <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> (1.1%), <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> (0.58%), and <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic> (0.51%). Parry et al reported that among 555 patients with lung adenocarcinomas, five known PGVs were identified in 2.5% of their patients. They concluded that for a subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, at least 2.5% to 4.5% carry germline variants that have been linked to cancer risk.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> From a study of unselected patients with advanced cancers, 1.4% (41% with LC) were found to have suspected or putative germline finding on tumor testing.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> From a study of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC, 2.2% harbored inherited germline mutations, with EGFR being the most common PGV identified (1.05%).<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Taken together, it seems reasonable to conclude that PGVs are infrequently identified in patients with LC but are seen in nearly 15% of patients with LC when the basis for ordering GGT is ostensibly the diagnosis of LC, as was the inclusion criteria for this study. Irrespective of the reason for the higher frequency of PGVs identified in this study, in comparison with other studies, this real-world finding suggests that far more patients diagnosed with LC and their families might benefit from GGT than are currently offered testing.</p><p>The current most common reason that GGT is recommended in any patient with cancer is a PH and/or FH suggesting a high pretest probability of uncovering a PGV. However, the recent Cancer Moonshot 2.0 Initiative includes recommendations that all patients diagnosed with cancer be assessed to determine eligibility for genetic testing, not only those patients with strong PH/FHs, in part because of socioeconomic disparities between patients referred for testing, but also because studies suggest reported FHs are not reliable for estimating pretest probabilities.<sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Cancer Moonshot 2.0 also recommends that payers not deny visits for genetic counseling on the basis of the pretest probability of patients carrying a PGV. Although the cost of universal testing of patients with cancer would be substantial, studies have shown that universal testing for the most common PGVs is cost-effective and saves lives, in part related to measures for early diagnosis and prevention endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Currently, among patients not meeting criteria for GGT, but who still wish to undergo GGT, only those patients who can afford to pay out of pocket for GGT will be tested. Thus, almost paradoxically, it is anticipated that if the universal referral recommendation by Cancer Moonshot 2.0 is adopted, since most patients do not meet current National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines than do, the gaps between socioeconomic groups in whom is tested will likely be widened.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Here, 14.3% who reported no FH of cancer had a positive result, suggesting that restricting testing to patients with LC with a FH of cancer may limit access for a number of patients and their families to the benefits of this genetic information. Several large studies show that a cancer diagnosis alone is a biomarker that predicts PGVs, one demonstrating over half of the clinically actionable PGVs would have been missed using guideline-directed testing on the basis of FH.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>When an incidental PGV finding is returned after somatic testing or when treatment decisions are informed by identifying a PGV, GGT is also National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#8211;recommended. The only example of referral for GGT based solely on a LC diagnosis is when tumor sequencing identifies an <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> p.T790M in the absence of previous <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In our study, 0.9% had <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> p.T790M PGVs. Patients confirmed to have <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> p.T790M PGVs appear to have roughly a 23% increased risk of LC, and screening for LC might be considered in these patients and for other cancers if proven to be <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-associated.</p><p>Our results support the emerging evidence that PGVs in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> T790M are not the only LC-predisposing PGVs. There were statistically significant increased frequencies of PGVs in this study in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic>, and Lynch syndrome&#8211;associated MMR genes compared with the frequencies seen in the referenced control cohort of unaffected individuals undergoing proactive genetic screening (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>) of 6.8-, 3.6-, 8.8-, 3.6-, and 2.7-fold, respectively. These findings represent further evidence suggesting that, like <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> p. T790M, these PGVs are cancer-predisposing. However, these PGVs should not be considered causative of LC. If these PGVs are established as LC-predisposing, additional studies will be needed to more precisely estimate the penetrance of these PGVs related to LC, particularly in the settings of other LC risk factors, such as cigarette smoking or harboring polymorphisms that affect tobacco metabolism.<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p><italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> PGVs were the most common PGVs identified, representing 17.4% of patients with positive findings, and numerous reports have suggested that <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> PGVs, like <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> T790M, are LC-predisposing.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although a PGV in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> in a patient with LC is not a US Food and Drug Administration&#8211;approved indication for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor use, such use could be considered if standard therapies have been exhausted or as part of a tumor-type agnostic PARP inhibitor clinical trial (eg, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02401347" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02401347</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03344965" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03344965</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, a DDR gene also involved in the activation of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, has previously been implicated as possibly LC-predisposing,<sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and increased screening for breast, colorectal, prostate, and other cancers is indicated when a PGV in <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> is identified.<sup><xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> It has also been suggested that PGVs in <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic> may open PARP inhibitors as a potential treatment option and may predict resistance to anthracycline therapy.<sup><xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> A probable association between LC and <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic> has been previously established, with case-control studies estimating odds ratios ranging from 3.66 to 4.6.<sup><xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> In addition to these PGVs being potentially LC-predisposing, patients and their family members can benefit enormously from recommended measures to prevent and diagnose early cancers for which these PGVs confer increased risk.</p><p>The majority of uncovered PGVs were in DDR genes and these warrant special attention because these PGVs inform targeted therapies for associated cancers and clinical trial eligibility. For example, identification of PGVs in DDR genes associated with non-LC informs treatment options with PARP inhibitors, improves outcomes, and, in some cases, increases overall survival for patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.<sup><xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Investigators recently reported that patients with small-cell LC who carry PGVs in <italic toggle="yes">BRIP1</italic>, a DDR gene, appear to have more benefit from platinum-based therapy than those who lack the same <italic toggle="yes">BRIP1</italic> PGV.<sup><xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Overall, the potential treatment benefit for patients with LC with DDR PGVs remains theoretical and deserves further investigation.</p><p>PGV rate in this study varied with genomic ancestry, calculated using AIMs embedded in the clinical genetic testing panel, with the highest percentage of findings in patients with EUR genomic ancestry. Using genomic ancestry enabled more inclusive analysis, as advocated by Oni-Orisan et al,<sup><xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and is key as research suggests implications of self-reported ancestry for patients with NSCLC.<sup><xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Genomic ancestry stratification of our cohort revealed a statistically disproportionate number of VUS among patients of historically under-represented populations, compared with those of EUR ancestry. This reinforces the need for future studies on PGVs and patient outcomes, stratified by genomic ancestry, to understand their impact on LC. It also underscores the need for equitable access to genetic testing for patients across ancestries.</p><p>Aspects of this retrospective study warrant comment. First, limited or no clinical data were available for assessing which patients in this cohort would have met National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for non-LC cancer types that would have resulted in referral for GGT. In particular, it is possible that GGT for many patients in this study was ordered because of a PH of another cancer type (ie, up to 71.1% of the cohort) or because of a FH of other cancer types. Although it would seem likely that many of the patients with multiple cancers would have been eligible for referral for genetic counseling, we do not have data to suggest what proportion of this group were seen by genetics, and of those, for what proportion GGT was recommended. Notably, we found the frequency of PGVs was not different between patients with only a LC history, patients with LC and PHs of non-LC, and patients with LC and PHs of non-LC and FHs of cancer. The finding that most patients had a PH of other cancers suggests that GGT after those earlier cancers were diagnosed may have allowed for increased screening and prevented other primary cancers from developing later.<sup><xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>Although the patient population may be representative of the average LC cohorts who undergo GGT testing, our cohort does not appear to be representative of the average LC cohort. For example, 71% of the patients tested were female, which does not correlate with the sex-stratified incidence of LC and may be related to reported FH of <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic>-related cancers in this group contributing to GGT. The diagnosis of LC was required for study eligibility, but we cannot be certain that all patients had, in fact, a diagnosis of primary LC. Although it is unclear what indication beyond LC (if any), in those patients with only a PH of LC, moved clinicians to order GGT, this study was not designed to assess differences in clinical practice. It is certainly possible that providers did not report the true indication they had used for GGT testing in this cohort. As with other studies of this type, we relied on the integrity and thoroughness of the information the ordering clinician provided on the test requisition. However, it is unlikely that providers would fail to report the true reason for ordering GGT testing, particularly given the lack of coverage for GGT in patients with solely a LC diagnosis. Ultimately, we are unable to verify the primary or secondary nature of the reported diagnosis, PH, and FH, because of the real-world setting of this study.</p><p>Another limitation is that included patients were referred for testing with various panel sizes (including single gene testing), and so, the PGV rate may be an underestimate, compared with if all patients had received 84-gene panel testing. Of note, only 4,349 patients were tested for <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>, whereas the other genes with the highest PGV rates had more than 6,500 patients tested.</p><p>Finally, 5.8% of positive patients had possibly mosaic positive results on a platform optimized to identify germline variants. Such a finding could represent germline mosaicism, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, or circulating tumor cells. Additional hematologic evaluations or GGT of other tissues (eg, fibroblasts) could help to determine the clinical significance of these results.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the largest study using clinical genetic testing to characterize both oncogene and tumor suppressor gene PGVs in a population of patients with LC stratified by genomic ancestry. It is estimated that there are currently 576,924 Americans living with a diagnosis of LC, roughly 85,962 of whom could have a PGV on the basis of our findings.<sup><xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> These results indicate that certain PGVs are particularly prevalent in patients with LC, suggesting that additional studies are needed to confirm which PGVs are LC-predisposing. Also, we found the frequency of PGVs and VUS vary according to genomic ancestry. Taken together, these findings suggest that once the patient has been informed of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to testing, it may be of interest to routinely examine all patients with LC for the presence of PGVs in cancer-risk genes, benefiting patients and their relatives.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="presented-at"><title>PRIOR PRESENTATION</title><fn specific-use="presented-at" fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented in part at the ASCO Monthly Plenary Series, virtual, August 16, 2022 and at the ASCO Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL, June 2-6, 2023.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="contributed"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><bold>Conception and design:</bold> Steven Sorscher, Brandie Heald, Scott T.
