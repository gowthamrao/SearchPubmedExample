presentation. This study identified sociodemographic and health-related
characteristics associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for a
clinical encounter compared to those with an SRD who are treated for other
reasons. <bold>Methods</bold>: Electronic health record (EHR) data on patients with an SRD
(n=12,358, ages 18-90) were used to assess if an SRD was the primary reason for
a clinical encounter from January 1, 2012-January 1, 2018. Patients were matched
on key demographic characteristics at a 1:1 ratio. Adjusting for covariates,
odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. <bold>Results</bold>: In the
matched cohort of 8,630, most reported male sex (65.8%), White race (70.0%), and
single marital status (62.7%) with a mean age of 47.2 (SD=14.6). Patient
reported female sex, Black race, age 70+, married status, and low-income
(&lt;$50,000) were associated with a lower likelihood of presenting to care for
an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter. A nicotine-, alcohol-,
opioid-, or stimulant-related diagnosis was associated with a higher likelihood
of presenting to care for an SRD as the primary reason for the clinical visit.
<bold>Conclusion</bold>: This is the first study to investigate whether sociodemographic and
health-related characteristics were associated with having an SRD as the primary
reason for a clinical encounter. Using rigorous methods, we investigated a
unique clinical question adding new knowledge to predictors of patients seeking
clinical care. Understanding these predictors can help us better align service
provision with population needs and inform new approaches to tailoring care.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>substance-related diagnosis</kwd><kwd>substance use disorder</kwd><kwd>health service utilization</kwd><kwd>clinical visit</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The treatment gap between the number of people with a substance-related diagnosis
(SRD) and the number treated represents a major public health challenge [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SRDs
are a common presentation in healthcare settings [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The International
Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> edition (ICD-10) classifies SRDs into
categories that include substance intoxication, withdrawal, use, substance use
disorder (SUD), misuse, and dependence (F10.xx-F19.xx). SRDs can be the main reason
for a clinical encounter, or one of several healthcare needs. Understanding who is
receiving clinical care for an SRD as the main reason for the encounter allows
healthcare providers to plan for the specific needs of these patients. In addition,
providers can consider addressing those who are treated primarily for other
healthcare needs, but also have an SRD.</p><p>Although there are no national rates for all SRDs, the 2020 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH) found that a past year SUD (defined by meeting Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria), which is a
sub-group of SRD, was reported in 40.3 million people (14.5%) ages 12 or older in
the United States [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the same year, 41.1
million people (14.9%) aged 12 and older were in need of SUD treatment (defined by
having a SUD or if they received treatment at a specialty facility in the past
year). However, 97.5% of those who needed treatment but did not receive it in the
past year, did not feel that they needed treatment. Research has shown that
socioeconomic and health related characteristics, such as sex and race, may be
associated with substance use treatment outcomes [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, there is limited data on the specific sociodemographic and
health-related characteristics of patients with SRDs being treated primarily for an
SRD. Identifying predictors of those <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> presenting for an SRD can
help further characterize those who may be in the &#8220;treatment gap.&#8221; Interventions can
be designed to improve access to treatment for those who are less likely to be
treated for an SRD as the primary reason for their healthcare encounter.</p><p>In the present study, electronic health record (EHR) data were used to identify
factors associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter
compared to those with an SRD who are treated for a different primary reason.
Identifying these factors can help us recognize the populations who are more or less
likely to make use of the healthcare system for treatment of an SRD and predict
populations less likely to be receiving care for SRDs, specifically looking at
populations that are underserved in healthcare, including those with a higher burden
of the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. We hypothesized that
patients in underserved population groups and with known health determinants will
have a greater health disparity in being treated primarily for a SRD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample and Data Source</title><p>With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, this retrospective observational
study used deidentified EHR data on patients 18-90 years of age with any ICD-10
code for an SRD (eg, alcohol, nicotine, stimulants, opioids) from a large
tertiary healthcare system in Southern California from January 1, 2012-January
1, 2018. Patients with ages &lt;18 or &gt;90 were excluded to reduce the risk of
identification due to the small number of individuals with and without an SRD in
these age ranges. This healthcare system is a referral center with a large urban
hospital and a large suburban hospital with a county-wide network of primary
care clinics in urban and suburban areas that also serve many rural residents.
Clinical services include inpatient and outpatient visits for primary, mental
health, addiction, and other medical specialty care. As such, this healthcare
system provides a full range of primary and specialty care.</p><p>All of these data were collected from the health center&#8217;s biomedical informatics
team through their standardized data request process. Data was provided in a
secured Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) approved
Virtual Research Desktop (VRD).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measures</title><p>The sociodemographic and health-related measures used in this study were selected
based on what was available in the EHR. Data included patient self-reported
characteristics such as sex (male, female), age (18-24, 25-39, 40-54, 55-69,
70+), race (Black, White, Other or Mixed (Asian/Pacific Islander, American
Indian/Alaska Native, other or mixed race)), Latinx ethnicity, and marital
status (single, married/living as married, divorced/separated/widowed). As a
proxy for household income, median income was assessed by patient zip code
estimates data from the US Census Bureau [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. After assessing the distribution of the data, income was then
categorized into &lt; $50,000, $50,000-$75,000, $75,000-$100,000, or $100,000+.
The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to create a summary variable that
captures medical health severity (&#8805; 1 Charlson Comorbidity (yes/no); Appendix A:
Table B in the supplemental material) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A serious mental
illness (SMI) diagnosis (yes/no) included any ICD-10 code for schizophrenia,
schizotypal disorder, persistent delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder,
other psychotic disorder not due to a substance or known physiological
condition, unspecified psychosis, manic episode, bipolar disorder, or major
depressive symptom severe (Table A in the supplemental material). A non-SMI
included any ICD-10 code for brief psychotic disorders, major depressive
disorder mild or moderate, persistent mood disorder, reaction to severe stress,
and/or adjustment disorders (includes post-traumatic stress syndrome), obsessive
compulsive disorder, phobic anxiety disorder, other anxiety disorder, eating
disorder, specific personality disorder, and/or impulse disorder (Table A in the
supplemental material).</p><p>For each clinical encounter, an ICD-10 code is assigned for the primary reason
for the encounter (eg, F10.xx alcohol-related diagnosis). The primary reason for
the encounter is decided by the provider at the time of the visit, is not
dependent on the chief complaint, and is coded in this study as &#8220;primary reason
for the encounter&#8221; (yes/no). Additional ICD-10 codes may be assigned as a
second, third, etc. reason for the encounter. Because this study aimed to
capture information from individuals presenting for any substance-related reason
(eg, use, misuse, dependence), and not just those with a clinically diagnosed
SUD, any patient with an ICD-10 code for a SRD&#8212;at any point during the study
period&#8212;were included in the SRD group. Those without an SRD as the primary
reason for the clinical encounter were included in the group with an SRD who
present for another clinical reason. The ICD-10 codes used to construct the SRD
cohort (F10.xx-F19.xx) are available in the supplemental material (Table A). The
SRD type variables included any alcohol-, nicotine-, stimulant (ie, cocaine,
other stimulants)-, opioids-, cannabis-, sedatives-, hallucinogen-, inhalant-,
or other psychoactive SRD. Due to diagnostic uncertainty, those with an ICD-10
code for multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances (F19.xx;
formerly known as &#8220;polysubstance abuse&#8221;) with no other code for an SRD (eg,
alcohol, opioids) were not included in the analysis. This is because it is not
possible to confirm that the patients with an F19.xx diagnosis should not be
included in one of the other substance type categories (eg, alcohol, stimulants,
nicotine, cannabis) used in the bivariate and multivariable regression models.
Those with an ICD-10 code for F19.xx and a co-occurring SRD code for specific
substances (eg, alcohol, opioids, etc.) remained in the analysis. Routine
screening for SRD in the healthcare system was not implemented at the time of
data collection. As such, SRDs were identified by the provider or
patient-reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data in the unmatched cohort.
Propensity score matching using the SAS PSMATCH procedure [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was used to produce a 1:1 statistical model by matching
on pre-existing health conditions, defined by &#8805; 1 Charlson Comorbidity (yes/no)
and SMI (yes/no), which are two predictors known to be associated with
healthcare service utilization in this population [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This
approach measures the imbalance in health-related characteristics by creating a
matched 1:1 sample of those with an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical
encounter compared to those who were treated for another reason [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The new generated 1:1 cohort allows for equal distribution of
pre-existing health conditions and SMI in both of the SRD groups (ie, primary
reason for a clinical encounter yes/no). To determine sociodemographic factors
associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter
compared to those with an SRD who are primarily treated for other clinical
reasons, bivariate analysis in the unmatched and matched cohort using
Chi-squared (<italic toggle="yes">X</italic><sup>2</sup>) tests of significance for
categorical data were used. To determine the effect/magnitude of the
associations, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and reported. Effect
sizes such as Phi for dichotomous measures were used in addition to p-values and
ORs to identify meaningful differences. However, OR confidence intervals that
cross 1 (indicating that there was no significant difference), p-values &#8804; 0.05,
and knowledge of any key predictor variables from the literature were used to
determine whether a covariate would be included in the final multivariable
regression. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to determine the
measures that were associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for a
clinical encounter compared to those with an SRD who are primarily treated for
other clinical reasons. Standardized betas (&#946;), standard errors (SE(&#946;)),
adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and the respective confidence intervals and p-values
were reported. None of the interaction terms (eg, age*sex, sex*race) that were
tested showed a large main effect. As such, interaction terms were not included
in the multivariable regression analyses. Sensitivity analyses were also
conducted by 1) including/excluding different covariates in the regression
models, and 2) including/excluding different variables in the matching procedure
to measure the robustness of the associations observed in the unmatched and
matched regression models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>There were 13,769 patients with any ICD-10 code for an SRD associated with their
visit to the health system EHR from January 1, 2012-January 1, 2018 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 1,411 (10.2%) had an
ICD-10 code for other psychoactive substances (F19.xx) with no other code for an
SRD (eg, alcohol, opioids). Because the type and number of substances could not
be determined, these individuals were not included in the analysis resulting in
a total of 12,358 with a specified SRD. The bivariate and multivariable analysis
results from the unmatched cohort (n=12,358) can be found in the supplemental
material (Tables C-D). Briefly, an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical
encounter was documented in 4,315 (34.9%) unmatched patients. Results from the
multivariable analyses in the unmatched cohort (n=11,080), showed that all of
the variables assessed in this study were significantly associated with having
an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter except for those who

sensitivity analyses did not change our understanding or approach. These results
are available upon request.</p><p>The matched cohort (n=8,630; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was
mostly male (65.8%), identified as White (70.0%), identified as non-Latinx

and in the $50,000-$75,000 income range (60.8%; mean = $68,811.3, SD =
20,554.3). Due to matching on &#8805; 1 Charlson Comorbidity Index and SMI in those
with and without an SRD, a Charlson comorbidity condition was identified in
38.5% and SMI was identified in 21.1%. Non-SMI was identified in 44.1%. An SRD
as the primary reason for a clinical encounter was documented in 4,315 (50.0%)
patients. Of these, an SRD for alcohol (58.2%), nicotine (11.4%), stimulants
(24.5%), opioids (20.9%), cannabis (7.5%), and sedatives (3.6%) were identified

encounter compared to patients who identify as White (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI =
0.61-0.82, p-value = &lt;0.0001). Having an SRD as the primary reason for a

an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter compared to those with an SRD
who are treated for other clinical reasons. By using real-world clinical data in
which the clinician identifies the primary reason for the clinical encounter, we can
better understand real life clinical encounters.</p><p>Findings from this study suggest that among those treated for an SRD, patients who
identified as female, reported Black race, and were age 70+, married, and low-income
(&lt;$50,000) were less likely to present to care for an SRD as the primary reason
for a clinical encounter. A nicotine-, alcohol-, opioid-, or stimulant-related
diagnosis was associated with a higher likelihood of presenting to care for an SRD
as the primary reason for the clinical encounter. A cannabis- and sedative-related
diagnosis was not associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical
encounter.</p><p>Significant attention has been placed on the impact of sociodemographic
characteristics such as sex and race/ethnicity, on of substance use treatment
services [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Results from this study show that those receiving care is
consistent with national rates of substance use by sex and age. For example, studies
have shown that compared to females, males are more likely to use substances and
their use is more likely to lead to ED visits and overdose deaths [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further study to clarify if the reduced
rate of females being treated primarily for substance use is commensurate with the
reduced rates of substance-related health problems in females would be
informative.</p><p>Our data also suggests that patients who identify as Black were less likely to have
an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter compared to patients who
identify as White. Research has shown that patients who identify as Black are less
likely to receive substance use services and are more likely to delay care [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
For those who do access care, there is a disproportionate use of emergency
psychiatric services, and they are more likely to be treated for reasons other than
their substance-related diagnosis [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
Studies have shown that certain minoritized populations (eg, Black/African
Americans) are less likely to report and seek treatment for their substance use due
to fear, perceived treatment need and efficacy, differences in recovery goals, and
other barriers stemming from cultural factors [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the current study, it
is possible that patients who do not identify as White are less likely to present
for care for an SRD as a primary reason due to culturally related barriers such a
stigma. For example, a qualitative study found that individuals who identify as
Black would initially avoid or delay mental health treatment due to concerns about
stigma and once they began treatment, they faced stigmatizing reactions from friends
and family [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another study found that
compared to individuals who identify as White, individuals who identify as Black
with an opioid use disorder had lower odds of utilizing substance use treatment
[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study adds to this body of
evidence by showing that patients who identify as Black are significantly less
likely to present for an SRD as their primary reason compared to patients who
identify as White.</p><p>Those with an alcohol-related diagnosis had the highest odds of having a SRD as the
primary reason for the clinical encounter, followed by a nicotine-, opioid-, and
stimulant-related diagnoses. Alcohol-, nicotine-, opioid-, and stimulant- related
diagnoses have been shown to have adverse impacts on morbidity that lead to higher
rates of healthcare utilization [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Surprisingly, cannabis- and
sedative-related diagnoses were not associated with having an SRD as the primary
reason for a clinical encounter. Individuals with cannabis use disorder typically
have high rates of comorbid substance use and mental health illnesses [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By matching on SMI, we were able to show
that having a cannabis-related diagnosis alone is not associated with a primary SRD.
Although studies suggest that benzodiazepine use is associated with increased ED
use, our study found no association between sedative-related diagnosis and a primary
SRD diagnosis [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Future studies should
investigate how substance-specific groups are engaging with the healthcare system,
determine rates of healthcare service utilization broadly and in what healthcare
settings and contexts, and assess if there are differences by substance type among
these vulnerable populations.</p><p>Having access to a large health record dataset allows for an in-depth review of the
prevalence and correlates of having an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical
encounter. This study is strengthened by the large sample size over 6 years of EHR
data. Utilizing EHR data allows for a unique perspective on the assessment of having
an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter among a large sample, which is
focused on provider diagnoses and outcomes instead of patient self-report. Provider
diagnoses are critical, as these reflect what the provider identified and is
providing care for, which is of interest in addition to knowing the prevalence of
true underlying disorders. However, some health-related diagnoses may be missing or
not adequately assigned in the EHR. It is possible that patients may have not
disclosed their substance use or providers did not know how to appropriately
diagnose an SRD. Consequently, there are likely many more patients with SRDs who
were not included in this study.</p><p>Our approach to conduct this study in a matched sample is supported by the fact that
important variables that may be associated with having an SRD as the primary reason
for a clinical encounter (eg, race, substance type) appear to not be significant in
the unmatched multivariable regression. This is likely due to the large impact that
pre-existing health conditions and SMI have on the model. Matching on these two
strong predictors allows for equal distribution of pre-existing health conditions
and SMI in both of the SRD groups. As a result, we see that race and substance type
are in fact associated with having an SRD as the primary reason for the clinical
encounter in the matched cohort.</p><p>This study is limited by the use of ICD-10 codes, which are designed to identify
diagnoses and procedures for billing purposes. This limitation is clearly observed
in the way many SRDs are identified in the EHR as &#8220;non-specified substance-related
disorder,&#8221; which is sufficient for billing purposes, though specific identification
of the involved substance is clinically and epidemiologically important. Further
exploration of the factors (eg, unable to identify substance, multiple substances)
contributing to a clinical provider&#8217;s decision to classify a patient with an SRD in
this ambiguous category instead of a designated substance type would be helpful to
improve code classification in the EHR. It would also be advantageous to clearly
identify the severity of the SRD in the EHR, as is recommended in the DSM-5.</p><p>The group of patients who have an SRD on their record but it is not listed as the
primary reason may fall into several groups: 1) those not receiving care for their
SRD, 2) those who are receiving care for it during the clinical encounter but have a
more pressing issue at that time, so SRD is not listed first, or 3) those who are
receiving specialty treatment related to their SRD elsewhere. This data set does not
allow us to determine which category a patient falls into. However, we can
reasonably say that if an SRD was listed as the primary visit diagnosis, then the
SRD would have been discussed in the visit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that patient reported female sex, Black race, older age, married/living as
married status, and low-income (&lt;$50,000) was associated with a lower likelihood
of presenting to care for an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter. A
nicotine-, alcohol-, opioid-, or stimulant-related diagnosis was associated with a
higher likelihood of presenting to care for an SRD as the primary reason for the
clinical encounter. Cannabis- and sedative-related diagnoses were not associated
with having an SRD as the primary reason for a clinical encounter.</p><p>Results from this study helps us characterize patients who receive care for SRDs
using demographic patterns, which can be used to understand disparities in care.
From a public health standpoint, socio-demographic variables are often used to
identify particularly vulnerable populations. Similarly, policy makers utilize
sociodemographic and health-related characteristics as well as social determinants
of health to aid their decision-making when examining structural differences in care
including disparities in health care. Considering the significant gaps in treatment
for SRD care for minoritized individuals, demographically characterizing those with
SRD would guide future research on social determinants of health aimed to identify
structural barriers to accessing care and can also assist clinicians during clinical
encounters.</p><p>Future studies should investigate how those with an SRD are engaging with the
healthcare system, determine rates of healthcare service utilization across
healthcare settings, and assess if there are differences by substance type among
vulnerable populations as another step towards reducing health disparities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions to this research by the Altman
