The age of the first sexual intercourse among adolescents has gotten earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The survey showed that the median age for first heterosexual intercourse was 17&#160;years in UK teenagers, and the proportion reporting first sexual intercourse before age 16 increased in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Earlier AFS was related to an increased subsequent risk-take behaviour and a higher likelihood of developing substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A phenome-wide study indicated that lower AFS was associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was causally associated with several CAD-risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein, higher fasting insulin, and fasting glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In contrast to earlier AFS, women delay pregnancy more frequently in their reproductive years, reaching an average of 30&#160;years in many countries and even later for men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A growing body of evidence supported an association between earlier AFB, cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. A British birth cohort study, including 7600 men and women, indicated that older parents had a lower cardiovascular risk as measured by multiple physiologic characteristics and biochemical markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous studies suggested that younger maternal AFB was associated with increased BMI and a higher risk of obesity and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, recent research demonstrated that younger AFB were independently associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One retrospective study, including over 500,000 participants from UK Biobank, has identified that earlier AFB was independently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Despite considerable effort, observational studies were sensitive to confounding bias and reverse causation. For these problems, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been advocated to overcome the limitations of conventional studies. MR is a genetic epidemiological method that uses single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the potential causality of exposure upon outcomes. MR is based on Mendel&#8217;s Law of Independent Assortment, wherein alleles are assigned at meiosis, conceptually mimicking a &#8220;natural&#8221; randomized trial. Recently, several studies explored the potential causal effects of age at menarche and age at menopause on health-related traits by using the MR strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Multivariable Mendelian randomization is a recently developed methodology that enables simultaneous assessment of correlated exposures by incorporating genetic variations from each risk factor into the same model. Multivariable MR analysis can reduce the influence of confounders when genetic variants are associated with several risk factors. Given the potential confounding and limited causal inference from observational data, we used MR and multivariable MR methods to evaluate the relationships between reproductive behaviours (AFS and AFB) and several cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par8">We performed a two-sample, summary-based MR analysis to assess the causal relationship of AFS and AFB with cardiovascular diseases using publicly available data.

AFS is assessed by using questions and treated as a continuous measure. Ages less than 12 are normally excluded.

By extracting summary statistics from several large GWASs, we could consider more cases by order of magnitude for AFB, AFS, and cardiovascular outcomes compared with previous observational studies. Residual confounding is one limitation of observational studies that may bias the estimates. The genetic instrument variables for AFB and AFS used in this study provided estimates less influenced by reverse causality and confounding factors. Because alleles are assigned at meiosis, MR conceptually mimicked a "natural" randomized trial, and we were able to estimate potentially causal relationships between AFB, AFS and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p id="Par24">The present study based on a GWAS of AFS (n&#8201;=&#8201;125,667) and AFB (n&#8201;=&#8201;343,072) found that genetic liability to late AFS and AFB were associated with a lower risk of a broad range of CVDs. The strongest associations were observed for coronary artery disease, myocardial infraction, heart failure. There was suggestive association for atrial fibrillation. The evidence supported a strong association between AFS and stroke but no association between AFB and stroke. AFS and AFB had a high genetic correlation with body mass index, alcohol intake, and smoking, which were well-known cardiovascular risk factors. Further, AFS and AFB were also genetically associated with depression and education attainment, which may be a confounder in the observed association between AFB, AFS and CVDs. The pattern of most associations remained significant after adjusting for smoking, alcohol, body mass index, and depression. However, in the multivariable MR models adjusting for education, the magnitude of most associations of attenuated mildly and these association did not persist, which suggested that education attainment might partly mediate the link from AFS and AFB to these CVDs.</p><p id="Par25">A recent comprehensive phenome-wide search indicated that genetic variants to higher cognition were associated with lower risks of CVDs, and this trend is in part attributed to higher AFS. They observed that lower AFS was concordantly associated with a higher risk of CVD in both males and females; lower AFS was causally associated with several CVD-risk factors. Our MR analysis further confirmed the potentially causal association between AFS and several CVDs by using the latest available and largest GWAS summary data of AFS. Many reproductive health-related factors, such as pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, preterm birth, early menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome, ever parity, and early menopause, were associated with cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of AFS with cardiovascular diseases is scarce. Although our MR analysis strongly supports a potentially causal relationship between late AFS and lower risks of several cardiovascular diseases, further clinical evidence is needed to validate this association.</p><p id="Par26">Previous studies observed that teenage motherhood was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. When looking at specific CVD outcomes, the majority of clinical observational studies identified that AFB was inversely associated with coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; our MR results provided evidence that may be consistent with a potential causal relationship. In a previous analysis that used prospective data from 482,000 women and men in the UK Biobank, an inverse relationship between AFB and the risk of CVDs (adjusted HRs for every year increase in AFB: 0.97, 95% CI 0.96&#8211;0.98), coronary heart disease (adjusted HRs: 0.96, 0.95&#8211;0.97) and stroke (adjusted HRs: 0.98, 0.97&#8211;0.99) was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Similarly, a statistically significant inverse association of ischemic stroke incidence with later AFB (age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;25 versus age 21&#8211;24&#160;years: HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.6, 0.4&#8211;0.9) was reported in a cohort study of 45,699 middle-aged women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, our results did not support a assocaiton between AFB and storke. The clinical evidence on the associations of AFB with atrial fibrillation and heart failure was scarce. Several lines of secondary evidence may lead to support these novel findings. In detail, studies revealed that early AFB (younger than 20&#160;years) was associated with several cardiovascular factors by mid-life, including body mass index, obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, C reactive protein, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The original GWAS of AFS and AFB also examined their influence on CAD through multivariable MR that adjusted for years of education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The results indicate significant associations between AFS and AFB with CAD, which were significantly attenuated by adjusting for years of education. A recent study by Wang et al. conducted a MR analysis that focuse on explore the causal relationship between women's reproductive traits and ischemic stroke, taking into consideration the potential influence of body mass index and educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. They found consistent and significant associations between earlier AFB and AFS and an increased risk of ischemic stroke, in both female-only and sex-combined analyses. Compared to the above two studies, our study evaluated the causal relationship between AFS and AFB and a diverse range of CVDs while adjusting for several modifiable risk factors. Although some results are consistent with previous studies, our research further discovered the causal relationship between AFS and AFB with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.</p><p id="Par28">The exact pathological mechanism between later AFS, AFB and decreased risk of CVDs was presently unclear. Several plausible biological pathways supported these associations. On the one hand, women who had conceived pregnancy before the age of 20&#160;years were more likely to develop pregnancy-related complications, including hypertension, eclampsia, lasting insulin resistance and altered cholesterol profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Some findings suggested that these pregnancy-related complications might contribute significantly to CVDs developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, AFS and AFB correlate with socioeconomic position and behavioural factors, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake and diet. Later parenthood might be related to greater control for health behaviours, such as smoking and alcohol intake, which influence CVDs development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An alternative explanation for the association of AFS and AFB with later health is that early parenthood may lead to reduced educational attainment and financial resources and change career trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], resulting in stress and poorer health. Nevertheless, early life circumstances, such as pubertal health and parental separation, might potentially confound the association of AFS and AFB with later health. Therefore, relatively little is known about why AFB and AFB were associated with later health.</p><p id="Par29">One significant strength of our study over previous studies was the great sample size in outcomes GWAS provided considerable statistical precision and accuracy. Observational studies are unavoidably subjected to confounding bias that may lead to spurious associations. MR design, especially multivariable MR analysis, reduced the impact of confounders. Furthermore, the statistical power for the analyses of AFS and AFB with cardiovascular outcomes was high. Nevertheless, the present study must be interpreted within the context of some limitations. First, we primarily focused on individuals of European ancestry in exposure and outcome datasets, so the population stratification bias was minimized, but it may limit generalization to other populations. Second, MR required a critical assumption that genetic association with the outcomes was through the exposure of interest and not via other pathways. Although findings were consistent in sensitivity analysis and adjusted for several cardiovascular risk factors, we could not entirely exclude the possibility that AFS and AFB influence CVDs through other factors and pathways. Third, the present study used linear MR analyses and showed that AFS and AFB were negatively associated with CVDs. We considered that nonlinear MR analyses need to be performed using stratified datasets (early and later age at first sex and birth) to further confirmed the association of AFS and AFB with CVDs. Finally, we conducted sex-specific MR analyses using available exposure data for AFS and AFB in men and women separately, and utilizing available outcome data from both sexes. However, it is better to analyze CVD outcomes separately for men and women.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, the present study using large genetic data supported a potentially causal relationship of genetic liability to later AFS and AFB with lower risks of several CVDs. Our finding suggested that it is important to provide sex education since early sex and birth may have undesirable effects. More frequent cardiovascular screening among individuals who have early sex or birth might help to prevent onset of CVDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
