However, duration of pharmacologic treatment was longer in the outpatient weaning groups in the majority of the studies. Furthermore, adverse events were rare and compliance to follow-up treatment was high among those who received outpatient weaning.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>home weaning; neonatal abstinence syndrome; outpatient treatment; outpatient weaning; pharmacologic treatment</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a multi-system disorder observed in infants experiencing withdrawal from opioid exposure <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> (Stover and Davis, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Care of infants typically begins with non-pharmacologic comfort measures to decrease the severity of symptoms and mitigate negative neonatal outcomes (Maguire, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Edwards and Brown, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However for infants who do not respond, pharmacotherapy may be warranted to manage the symptoms of withdrawal (McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Traditionally, pharmacologic treatment for infants with NAS is completed in-hospital until infants are stable and fully weaned from medication. However, there is some evidence to suggest that some hospitals may continue an outpatient weaning regimen (Napolitano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chau <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), as many infants with NAS are otherwise healthy (Burns <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; O&#8217;Grady <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This type of combined inpatient/outpatient treatment may assist to alleviate the strain of NAS on the healthcare system and decrease separation of mothers and infants. However, there is currently no consensus or standard of care to guide outpatient weaning (Chau <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Understanding the evidence regarding outpatient weaning for NAS is an important consideration for organizations seeking to adopt this method. To date, there are no systematic reviews available on outpatient weaning for NAS. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to assess the existing literature regarding the effectiveness and safety of outpatient pharmacologic weaning on NAS outcomes for infants with NAS. The specific review question was: Among infants with NAS who require pharmacologic treatment, what is the effect of a combined inpatient/outpatient weaning (eg, home weaning) versus in-hospital weaning on NAS outcomes (eg, length of stay, duration of treatment, cost, breastfeeding) and infant safety.</p><p>NAS presents as central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and gastrointestinal disturbances (Kocherlakota, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Stover and Davis, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Defining characteristics of the syndrome include a high pitched cry, irritability, fever, tremors, excessive sucking, weight loss, loose stools, poor feeding, sleep disturbances, excoriation of the skin, respiratory distress, and seizures (Finnegan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). Clinical manifestations of the syndrome are variable and are based on the type of opioid, timing of exposure, and maternal and placental metabolism (Hudak and Tan, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Initial signs of NAS are often observed within the first 24&#8211;72 h (Hudak and Tan, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kaltenbach and Jones, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>); with most infants demonstrating signs of withdrawal within 12 h of birth (Kaltenbach and Jones, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of NAS has risen dramatically in the United States. Between the years 2000 and 2009 the incidence of NAS increased from 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04&#8211;1.37) to 3.39 (95% CI: 3.12&#8211;3.67) infants per 1000 hospital births annually (Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In 2013, a total of 4% of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions across the United States were attributed to a diagnosis of NAS (Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similar increases in the incidence of NAS have been reported in Canada (Davies <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and across Western Australia (O&#8217;Donnell <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), indicating the impact from a global perspective. The higher rates of NAS correspond to the increased incidence of maternal opioid use during pregnancy (Epstein <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Krans <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), inclusive of illicit opioid use (Cicero <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), prescribed opioids for pain (Ailes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Warren <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and the rise in opioid replacement therapies for pregnant women with addictions (Jansson <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; O&#8217;Grady <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Numerous negative outcomes have been associated with NAS including admission to a special care nursery (Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Uebel <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), a lengthy hospitalization period (Wachman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and separation of mother and infant at a critical time for bonding (Abrahams <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wiles <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Lengthy periods of hospitalization are often required due to the need for pharmacologic management of withdrawal symptoms (Jansson <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hudak and Tan, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, decreased rates of breastfeeding (Wachman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Tsai and Doan, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and involvement in the child protection system (O&#8217;Donnell <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) are additional negative outcomes associated with NAS.</p><p>Although not all substance-exposed infants require pharmacologic treatment, a substantial number (60&#8211;80%) do require treatment to manage withdrawal (Kocherlakota, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Pharmacologic treatment is diverse and is often contingent on physician practices or specific organizational protocols (Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) as no universal pharmacologic treatment has been established. Methadone or oral morphine are recommended as a first-line pharmacologic treatment for opioid withdrawal, although clonidine and buprenorphine have also been administered to manage the symptoms (McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies identify that the practice of continuing pharmacologic weaning for NAS out of the hospital setting has been implemented in some healthcare institutions (Saunders <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kaltenbach and Jones, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Kraft <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In particular, in a study evaluating quality improvement for NAS, Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) found that 34% of infants from 199 centers were discharged from the hospital on medication to be weaned in a home environment. However, there is no consensus or standard of care to guide outpatient weaning (Chau <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, this systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of outpatient weaning for infants with NAS. Effectiveness was determined by synthesizing the results of studies reporting between group comparisons (inpatient versus outpatient weaning) on NAS outcomes. In addition, safety was assessed by making between group comparisons on variables such as adverse events, child welfare involvement, compliance with follow-up, and hospital readmission rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general"><title>Search strategy</title><p>The electronic databases PubMed, Nursing and Allied Health, CINAHL, Evidence-Based Medicine, Web of Science, Medline, and PsychINFO were searched from 1996 to October, 2017.

Thus, NAS in infants exclusively from substances other than opioids (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were excluded from this review. Additional exclusion criteria included: (1) infants being treated for NAS with paregoric, tincture of opium or diazepam as they are not currently recommended for treatment of NAS and (2) infants who were readmitted to hospital with NAS after discharge. Outpatient weaning refers to infants who were initiated on pharmacologic treatment in hospital and received continued pharmacologic treatment for weaning as an outpatient.</p><p>The first author entered all studies from the search into the Zotero Reference Manager.

</p><p>The studies evaluated within this review outlined various practices in the care of infants with NAS. Most studies identified a detailed discharge plan for infants beginning a home weaning program. While all of the studies that indicated the use of a discharge plan required established medical follow-up from a neonatologist or pediatrician, the remaining elements were diverse. The hospital practices included medical stabilization (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>); social stability established by social work (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015); a physician/caregiver agreement (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) confirmed family and social support (Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015); and nursing home visits or calls post-discharge (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The primary medications used for pharmacologic treatment of NAS were morphine (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=4), methadone (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=1), or either morphine or methadone (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=1) (see <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Phenobarbitone was used as monotherapy for a very small number of infants (eg, &lt;5%), and as a second (eg, adjunctive) medication during home weaning in two studies (Abdel-Latif <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The Finnegan or modified version of the Finnegan Scoring tool was used to assess symptoms of NAS and guide treatment in all of the studies. However, it was unclear if they were the same tools as the number of items and/or modifications were not specified. This reflects the diversity of the studies included in the systematic review in terms of treatment (medication, weaning protocols) and outcome measures and participants (eg, mothers in treatment, polysubstance use, term/premature infants).

Selection bias was present among all studies as the groups were not similar at the outset. Most of the studies identified that infants receiving home weaning had to meet certain discharge criteria for eligibility, which typically included family stability. Likewise, a lack of reporting and/or controlling for confounding variables was present in the majority of studies. Many of the studies reported on baseline characteristics of infants and mothers such as gestation, birth weight, smoking that may affect NAS symptoms; however, other potential confounding factors such as maternal drug and non-pharmacologic treatment for NAS were not controlled for in the analysis. While all studies identified using the Finnegan Scoring Tool or Modified Finnegan to assess NAS and guide treatment, no studies reported on psychometric data regarding the reliability or validity of the tool. Finally, for many of the outcomes it was unclear whether there was a loss to follow-up and how many infants were included in the final analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3" sec-type="general"><title>Home weaning and NAS outcomes</title><p>Of the six studies included, all reported on one or more NAS outcomes including length of hospital stay, duration of treatment, healthcare costs and breastfeeding (see <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All studies found that there was a significantly reduced length of hospital stay associated with home weaning. Among infants who received outpatient weaning, the shortest length of stay was 7.3 days (Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and longest was 18.9 days (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For infants who received only in-hospital weaning, the length of stay was much longer, ranging from 15.7 days (Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) to 39.6 days (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). With the decreased length of stay, considerable cost savings were reported among the three studies that evaluated healthcare expenditures (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015; Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>While length of stay was reduced, the total duration of opioid treatment for infants who received the outpatient weaning was often longer. In three out of four studies, researchers found that infants who received home weaning received opioid treatment for a longer time period compared with in-hospital treatment (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015).

Despite the variations in the duration of treatment among studies, no significant differences were found between groups related to cumulative dosage of morphine (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found a lower cumulative dose of morphine (mg/kg/birth weight) for those weaned at home (10.2) compared to in-hospital (11.4), although not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.28).

Adverse events that were reported among infants on home weaning included one readmission for NAS due to two missed methadone doses (Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and one case of sudden infant death syndrome attributed to unsafe sleeping (Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). Comparatively, infants weaned in hospital were more often readmitted for withdrawal treatment after discharge than those weaned at home (4/28 versus 1/52, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.44) (Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). Further, a higher proportion of infants in the hospital group required child protection involvement (OR 0.015, 95% CI: 0.06&#8211;0.36) or foster care (OR 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03&#8211;0.58) when compared with infants weaned at home.</p><p>Positive outcomes were also identified regarding outpatient follow-up and child welfare involvement for infants who received home weaning.

In addition, there was a decreased need for child welfare involvement for the home weaning group compared with in-hospital (24% versus 68%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001) (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of outpatient pharmacologic weaning for infants with NAS. Overall, all studies consistently identified that outpatient weaning for select infants, was associated with shorter hospital stays compared with infants weaned in-hospital only. These findings were consistent regardless of the pharmacologic agent used to wean (methadone, morphine) and the healthcare provider regimen for follow-up. Furthermore, three of the six studies (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kelly, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported a reduction in healthcare expenditures for infants weaned at home; however, only one study provided cost estimates of ~$11 000 in healthcare savings for each neonate (Kelly, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This review also identified that adverse events were rare and compliance to follow-up treatment was high among those who received outpatient weaning.</p><p>Decreased length of hospital stay is an important development given that the length of hospital stay for infants with NAS has remained relatively unchanged in over a decade (Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This is substantial as Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) estimated the average costs of NAS as $53 400 per infant (95% CI: $49 000&#8211;$57 700), while Tolia reported that 4% of all NICU days across the United States are attributed to NAS. With the incidence of NAS and related healthcare expenditures on the rise (Patrick <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), a reduction in the period of hospitalization for infants with NAS will invariably lead to a reduction in acute healthcare-related expenditures.</p><p>Despite the improvements to the length of hospital stay for infants receiving outpatient weaning, concerns exist regarding the longer duration of outpatient pharmacologic treatment found in three of the studies (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). A longer duration of pharmacologic treatment requires careful consideration given that the long-term outcomes of prolonged opioid treatment are unclear (Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kraft <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, while the duration of treatment was longer, the cumulative dose of pharmacologic treatment did not differ between the inpatient and outpatient groups in two of the three studies that measured cumulative dose (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, the longer duration of treatment did not directly translate into receiving a higher dosage of the medication. The longer duration is likely reflective of a slower taper, which may be advantageous for infants receiving outpatient weaning as few infants returned to hospital for further NAS treatment (Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). These findings support the assertion by Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) that the use of evidence-based protocols for the management of NAS are needed to improve neonatal outcomes. Thus, further evaluation of weaning protocols and the length of opioid treatment is needed.</p><p>Overall, this review found that serious short-term adverse events were rare (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hall <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015; Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and there was a high rate of compliance with outpatient follow-up. Furthermore, findings revealed that infants receiving outpatient weaning more frequently remained in the care of their biological parents when compared with in-hospital only groups (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Among the majority of studies, very few child protection concerns were reported for infants weaned at home. However, one study reported a high rate of infant apprehensions in both the in-hospital and outpatient weaning group (Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). While all institutions had eligibility criteria for outpatient weaning, the criteria were diverse, and optimal conditions for infant safety have not been established. These are important considerations given that research has found infants with NAS are at a greater risk for involvement with the child welfare system at some point in their early development (O&#8217;Donnell <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>The findings from this review identified higher rates of breastfeeding for infants who were receiving outpatient weaning for NAS (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the mechanism for improved breastfeeding outcomes found in these studies is unknown. Maintaining the mother&#8211;infant dyad may have positively influenced breastfeeding outcomes and/or the engagement with diverse primary care providers involved in the care of infants receiving outpatient weaning. The differences between groups may also be reflective of selection bias with mothers in the in-hospital weaning group more often using multiple substances (Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which is considered a contraindication to breastfeeding (Reece-Stremtan and Marinelli, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Regardless, these are noteworthy findings as breastfeeding has been associated with positive impacts on NAS outcomes including delayed symptom onset (Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), reduced incidence, decreased severity of symptoms, and decreased pharmacotherapy compared with infants who are not breastfed (Pritham, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Welle-Strand <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As such, breastfeeding should be recommended as a supportive non-pharmacologic treatment for NAS among stabilized mothers (Bagley <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kaltenbach and Jones, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite the potential benefits associated with breastfeeding, rates remained low in this population (Backes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smirk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kelly <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015). This finding is consistent with previous research reporting on low rates of breastfeeding for infants with NAS (Wachman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Many infants requiring pharmacologic treatment for NAS are treated in a special care nursery in isolation from their mothers (Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Uebel <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), thus inhibiting exclusive breastfeeding (Flacking <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Additional barriers to breastfeeding for infants with NAS may include NAS symptoms (eg, irritability, tachypnea, increased tone) and lack of information or discouragement of breastfeeding by healthcare professionals (McQueen and Murphy-Oikonen, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tsai and Doan, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Infants treated in a home environment have less structural barriers to impede breastfeeding which may positively influence breastfeeding rates among infants with NAS.</p><p>Additional benefits may be associated with outpatient weaning that have not been evaluated in this systematic review. Lengthy hospitalization for infants with NAS is associated with the separation of mother and infant at a critical time for infant development and bonding (Cleary <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tolia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Uebel <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Given that the postnatal period is a crucial time for maternal-infant bonding and subsequent attachment (Crouch and Manderson, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Shannon <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), a treatment model that decreases the separation of mother and infant may positively influence the maternal-child relationship. Thus, implementing outpatient weaning for NAS has the potential to empower mothers to assume the caregiver role in a natural environment and develop a bond with their newborn, while facilitating recovery from NAS symptoms.</p><sec id="sec4-1" sec-type="limitations"><title>Limitations</title><p>All of the included studies were retrospective in nature and relied on the accuracy of medical records. Many studies had small sample sizes of infants that received home weaning and for some studies, evaluating home weaning was not the primary purpose. Furthermore, while the included studies discuss reduced healthcare expenditures related to decreased length of hospital stay, there was a lack of clarity of how costs were measured in two of the three studies that evaluated this outcome. In addition, the critical appraisal identified that the majority of included studies were at moderate of bias. Thus, the generalizability of the findings is limited to a select group of mothers and infants who may be appropriate for home weaning. As a result of the identified limitations, results of the systematic review need to be interpreted cautiously.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="general"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The benefits of outpatient weaning for length of hospital stay and related healthcare expenditures have influenced some healthcare institutions and provider groups to explore outpatient weaning as a treatment option for select infants with NAS. The presence of few adverse events and safety concerns likely reflects the well-developed protocols used to guide primary healthcare providers&#8217; decision making in many of the included studies. Given the social risk factors associated with substance use (Meyer <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Traube, <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), hospitals implementing outpatient weaning need to consider social stability and follow-up services available to infants with NAS. Social stability may require a psychosocial assessment from an in-hospital social worker before consideration for discharge. Follow-up services that are inclusive of pharmacologic management and/or monitoring, nursing, social, or familial supports may also be beneficial to both mother and infant. Given the diversity of approaches to establish safety criteria before discharge of infants to continue weaning in a home environment, there is a need for further research to establish optimal eligibility criteria to promote infant safety.</p><p>Further, primary care providers supporting families receiving home weaning need protocols in place to guide decision making regarding referral to other disciplines (eg, physicians, social work, lactation specialists, nurses, etc.). Given that infants and families undergoing home weaning for NAS require both pharmacologic treatment and social follow up, there is a role for primary healthcare providers to assume the care of infants receiving outpatient weaning for NAS. However, this role requires further development to ensure infant safety and well-being.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="general"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>Findings from this systematic review have several research implications. Larger, prospective studies are required to rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of home weaning. Further research is also required to identify whether there is an optimal protocol to guide treatment with an emphasis on evaluating duration of treatment, cumulative dose and safety (eg, adverse events). Moreover, consideration should be given to the challenges of identifying which NAS outcomes are important to measure. Improving length of stay is important from a cost perspective; however, future research is needed to conduct robust economic evaluations to ascertain healthcare savings for infants weaned at home. Furthermore, duration of treatment and cumulative dose have potential negative impacts on infants and must be considered. Further exploration of eligibility criteria for home weaning that optimizes infant safety is also necessary before recommending this treatment approach. In addition, given that home weaning is a relatively new practice, qualitative research that explores the experiences of mothers is needed to understand mother&#8217;s perception of their role in outpatient weaning, effectiveness of supports, and efficacy in providing this treatment in a home environment. Finally, further research is required on the effect of the involvement of a multi-disciplinary team on outpatient weaning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this systematic review suggest that outpatient weaning for select infants with NAS was effective in reducing the length of hospital stay with minimal adverse outcomes or need for child welfare involvement. However, the duration of pharmacologic treatment was typically longer for infants weaned at home and warrants further evaluation due to the unknown long-term effects of opioids on infants. Furthermore, given the reduction in the length of hospital stay, outpatient weaning may be effective in reducing related healthcare costs, however, large-scale trials are required to establish cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>None.</p><p><bold>Financial Support</bold></p><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p><p content-type="COI-statement"><bold>Conflicts of Interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></ack><ref-list id="refs"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Abdel-Latif</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Oei</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Lui</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <collab><bold>NSW and ACT NAS Epidemiology Group</bold></collab> (<year>2013</year>) <article-title>Profile of infants born to drug-using mothers: a state-wide audit</article-title>. <source>Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health</source><volume>49</volume>, <fpage>E80</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>E86</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22530812</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1111/j.1440-1754.2012.02471.x</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Abrahams</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>MacKay-Dunn</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Nevmerjitskaia</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>MacRae</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Hodgson</surname><given-names>ZG</given-names></name> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>An evaluation of rooming-in among substance-exposed newborns in British Columbia</article-title>. <source>Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada</source><volume>32</volume>, <fpage>866</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>871</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21050520</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1016/S1701-2163(16)34659-X</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Ailes</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Lind</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Gilboa</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Frey</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Broussard</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Honein</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><collab>, <bold>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</bold></collab> (<year>2015</year>) <article-title>Opioid prescription claims among women of reproductive age-United States, 2008-2012</article-title>. <source>MMWR.
