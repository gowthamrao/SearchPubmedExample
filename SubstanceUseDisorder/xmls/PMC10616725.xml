Participants were recruited via community partners and snowball sampling. Participants who survived an intentional firearm injury, were shot within Indianapolis, were aged 13 years or older, and were English speaking were eligible.

Survivors described family members, friends, and informal networks as their main source of emotional support.

And I wanna say, what, 3 of them died out of, what, 6 or something like that. Three of &#8216;em... Yeah, so I think like 3 of them died before 30. And it was from some kind of monetary intent.

Adult male 8 stated, &#8220;Really, I was still doing the same thing, running around these streets. So, it [the shooting] didn&#8217;t affect me none.&#8221;</p><p>The second main theme was their unwillingness to talk. Participants expressed they were unwilling to discuss their shooting with a therapist due to a lack of trust among people outside their immediate network. Youth male 7 noted, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really rely on the doctor, I relied on my mom a lot. It&#8217;s just a thing about me with other people. I don&#8217;t trust a lot of people, and with that situation, it just really boosted up my anxiety a lot, and upped the ante for me not to trust people more.&#8221; Participants were fearful of getting in trouble with the police and even viewed speaking to a practitioner as snitching or informing on someone else. Youth male 5 said, &#8220;It because back then when you&#8217;re in the street you any time might, keeping the code of the street you ain&#8217;t death no more than you ain&#8217;t trying to get no help. You ain&#8217;t trying to ask nobody for no help or nothing, or tell the police. That&#8217;s called snitching.&#8221; When the interviewer asked, &#8220;And so going to get services leads to&#8230;,&#8221; the participant replied, &#8220;Snitching.&#8221; Therefore, most participants chose to not seek care or talk to anyone outside their trusted network about their injury.</p><p>The third theme related to family members and informal healing. Nearly all participants discussed how they received their own physical and emotional healing through family members and friends. Adult female 6 stated, &#8220;Well, my mom, I&#8217;ll call her &#8216;cause I don&#8217;t really go around her. So I&#8217;ll just call her and tell her what&#8217;s on my mind. She&#8217;ll give me a positive response. My man, I talk to him, pull him to the side and tell him what&#8217;s going on. He&#8217;ll give me a real-life response, and my sister, she gives me a spiritual response.&#8221; Family members and informal networks also facilitated connections to formal mental health services through word of mouth and family encouragement. Adult male 15 said, &#8220;Yeah. I met with my sister&#8217;s doctor. Yeah, yeah. My family doctor, my family. That was&#8230; It got me on my feet.&#8221; Participants also discussed how their shooting impacted their families emotionally during the period after injury. Adult male 4 stated, &#8220;Yeah, because it impacts everybody. The more I&#8217;m impacted, it impacts... I got 3 kids, 3 baby mamas and a girlfriend. Man, all 4 of them ladies is impacted and affected by what&#8217;s affecting me. And then my kids... It trickles down. You know what I&#8217;m saying? And then my kids are affected because what&#8217;s affecting me affects them and then their mamas and then the mamas affect the kids.&#8221; Additionally, participants discussed the need to relocate residences due to fear since the offender knew where they lived, which put additional emotional and financial burdens on their families. Youth male 3 said, &#8220;Because my mom, she was scared. Me and my sisters and my girl and my mom, we all lived there. So, my mama moved because she didn&#8217;t want nobody come to our house or shoot up the house or something while her daughter&#8217;s in there. How it impacted my family &#8216;cause like we don&#8217;t have a home, you know we homeless. My mum over there, I&#8217;m over here, we mean... Everything got messed up. Everything just got torn apart split up&#8230; She didn&#8217;t wanna live where she ain&#8217;t feel safe.&#8221;</p><p>The fourth theme related to credible messengers and trusted space. Participants that attended formal mental health services following their injury were connected through a credible messenger, such as a prior mental health or primary care practitioner or a violence intervention specialist through the local HVIP. Participants expressed they had an established trusted connection with the practitioner, felt they were being heard, and that the practitioner understood their needs. Youth male 2 said, &#8220;I was connected with him before I got shot, so he was my doctor before I even got shot, but by me getting... That&#8217;s why I think he did what he did because we had rapport already, and he knew I wasn&#8217;t just BS&#8217;ing him and I think... This is just me thinking, but I think we&#8217;re humans, we made connection.&#8221; On the contrary, mental health practitioners were perceived as unable to be helpful to survivors if they were not viewed as trustworthy and relatable. Adult male 1 stated, &#8220;I told them in the group this, any my counselors and everything, they had no answer. What do I do when I&#8217;m out with my family? Because like I said, I wanna go on my trips, I wanna go to the pool, I wanna go out to eat, I wanna go to baseball. And I&#8217;ll walk, and it&#8217;s one thing if I see him [offender] from a distance. It&#8217;ll be like, &#8216;Oh, ya&#8217;ll we gotta go.&#8217; It&#8217;s another thing when I&#8217;m up and I look up, and he look up [offender] and see me. Then its like, &#8216;damn.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>When asked about their ideal mental health services, participants discussed the desire for 1-on-1 therapy, group therapy, telehealth services, and that services should be provided in the heart of the Black community, while others wanted to seek services outside the city (ie, suburbs). No matter the mechanism, participants expressed the desire for someone who understood them, who understood their life and community, who was not going to judge, and, ultimately, someone who resembled them. Youth male 2 said, &#8220;It would have to be somebody like me. Someone they will really interact with. Okay, Boom. Now I got your attention versus this guy that&#8217;s got this button-up on, man. I got your attention.&#8221;</p><p>Lastly, some participants conveyed the interview process provided an opportunity for them to share their story within a confidential space and gave them a level of emotional relief they had not experienced before. Adult male 1 said, &#8220;Yeah, this is support. Just being able to go somewhere and talk is support. Even if y&#8217;all doing research, for me it&#8217;s therapy.&#8221;</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI231173"><title>Discussion</title><p>This qualitative analysis provided novel perspectives on firearm injury survivors&#8217; experiences with healing from the emotional consequences of their shooting. In addition to key facilitators and barriers to seeking formal mental health care, major findings included the importance of informal sources of emotional support for firearm injury survivors from family, friends, and informal networks. Second, the results highlighted the emotional consequences the shooting had on survivors&#8217; families&#8212;particularly mothers, partners, and children&#8212;by inflicting emotional distress, anger, and fear for their safety. This led several families to move residences and to live with other family members. These findings highlight the ripple effects of firearm injury beyond the direct survivor to family members, adding to the growing literature in this area.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>This study identified 3 main themes and barriers to survivors accessing mental health services: perceived lack of benefit of mental health services, distrust in practitioners, and fear of stigma and punitive backlash. Most importantly, firearm injury survivors overwhelmingly expressed their desire to navigate firearm injury recovery on their own, and half believed they were adequately coping without formal mental health services. Survivors doubted the ability of practitioners to give helpful advice, as practitioners did not understand their life and community environments. Survivors expressed a general lack of trust during the period after injury, which was intensified by a history of complex trauma.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This distrust extended to service systems meant to support survivors, including mental health practitioners.</p><p>In addition to distrust, survivors in this study expressed a fear of getting in trouble or being viewed as a snitch within their communities for talking with a mental health practitioner. The antisnitching code of silence is an informal rule within the subcultural code of the streets<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> People who break the code may be susceptible to physical injury themselves.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The antisnitching code has been largely applied to speaking with the police and victim&#8217;s services offered within police departments.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Survivors often perceive blurred lines between medical professionals and police at the time of their firearm injury.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Our findings demonstrate the antisnitching code also extends to mental health practitioners and is a crucial barrier to survivors of firearm injury seeking potentially helpful mental health services.</p><p>Our findings also demonstrated 2 key facilitators to seeking mental health care: a safe space/environment for the survivor to express themselves and a credible messenger. One-third of survivors expressed that the research interview was the first time they had discussed their shooting, and they felt comfortable doing so because of the privacy and anonymity. Survivors also expressed the importance of cultural congruence and having a credible messenger among their care team. This has been noted as a criteria for violence intervention specialists and is supported in other studies on firearm injury survivors.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Similarly, our findings extended this concept to include clinicians with whom survivors had a prior connection; often a pediatrician or other primary care practitioner. Such practitioners served as key facilitators to mental health care after injury among survivors in this study. Participants described high levels of trust in these practitioners, attributed to their general understanding of the survivors&#8217; life and lack of judgement. Participants valued the ability to express their stories freely with them. These findings suggest the importance of engagement with primary care practitioners and regular health care screening for risk of firearm injury.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Our findings have several implications to improve the connection to care and for future research. Given survivors&#8217; preference for informal services, we need to explore new paradigms for delivering mental health services, such as digital health, community-based and family-led support. Digital nonemergency transportation services (eg, Uber Health) for survivors and families have demonstrated success in better connecting patients with HVIPs.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Other mobile-based applications have shown utility in implementing mental health-based interventions among patients with trauma.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> For instance, a technology-based, stepped, access-to-care model has shown high rates of acceptability and engagement among trauma survivors, including those impacted by violence.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Encouragingly, similarly high rates of engagement in recommended treatment services have been observed among participants regardless of racial or ethnic background.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Adapting such interventions for survivors of firearm injury and families is a clear future direction.</p><p>Family members were also identified as a main source of support after injury. Family involvement is often a key factor in preventing mental health concerns and promoting behavioral health recovery following trauma.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In some cases, existing support from families and peers may be sufficient in helping survivors weather the aftermath of a trauma. In other cases, formal treatment services are warranted. Future work should consider ways to raise awareness among family members regarding mental health resources and how best to connect their loved ones with effective services. Additionally, programs should expand mental health resources to family members.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>These findings also highlighted the importance of tailoring interventions to an individual&#8217;s needs and cultural values,<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> such as incorporating culturally specific coping strategies into trauma-focused treatment, which yield better outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi231173r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231173r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Steps to achieve this include training more mental health professionals from underrepresented communities, strengthening community partnerships, and public health messaging campaigns to improve connection to care.

Recruitment among this population was challenging due to mistrust and fear of getting in trouble; we mitigated this through our partnership with our community-based organization; conversely, our sample size is smaller. We met saturation after 15 interviews; however, we were only able to recruit 2 female participants and were unable to reach saturation among female survivors. We noted some differences among female survivors, and examining experiences among female survivors is a clear direction for future research. The majority (61%) of participants were interviewed within 5 years of their shooting; other participants&#8217; memories of events may have changed given the amount of time between their shooting and the interview.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI231173"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This qualitative study illustrated the fear of stigma, inadequate trusted resources within communities, and the need for awareness of and access to resources for families and communities impacted by firearm violence. It is vital to improve engagement with mental health care with credible messengers through multiple delivery mechanisms, such as digital health, community-based interventions, and family support. Healing the emotional trauma associated with firearm injury for both survivors and families can reduce health disparities, prevent future firearm violence, and improve population health.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI231173"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi231173r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Wounded: life after the shooting</article-title>. <source>Ann Am Acad Pol Soc Sci</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>642</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>244</fpage>-<lpage>257</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/0002716212438208</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231173r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Grey</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Pathways to recurrent trauma among young Black men: traumatic stress, substance use, and the &#8220;code of the street&#8221;</article-title>. <source>Am J Public Health</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>95</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>816</fpage>-<lpage>824</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2105/AJPH.2004.044560</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15855457</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC1449260</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231173r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Magee</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Aalsma</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Fortenberry</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Gharbi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wiehe</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Mental health outcomes from direct and indirect exposure to firearm violence: a cohort study of nonfatal shooting survivors and family members</article-title>. <source>J Crim Justice</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>83</volume>:<elocation-id>101961</elocation-id>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2022.101961</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231173r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Magee</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Dennis Fortenberry</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Aalsma</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Gharbi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wiehe</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Healthcare utilization and mental health outcomes among nonfatal shooting assault victims</article-title>. <source>Prev Med Rep</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>27</volume>:<elocation-id>101824</elocation-id>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101824</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">35656226</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC9152773</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231173r5"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Rosenfeld</surname><given-names>R</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Ernesto</surname><given-names>L</given-names></string-name></person-group>.
