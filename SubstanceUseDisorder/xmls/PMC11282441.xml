The Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse then extracted a single race and ethnicity for each individual using a hierarchy of which data sets most reliably used self-reported race and ethnicity. In the case of more than one race being reported, we used the following approach: take the most frequently reported race and ethnicity for that individual, and if there was a tie for the most frequently reported race and ethnicity for that individual, and one of those tied values was Hispanic, then the individual was identified as Hispanic. Otherwise, individuals were assigned as the least common race in Massachusetts that they had listed as one of their tied race categories with the following configuration: the least common were American Indian/Alaska Native/Other, non-Hispanic; second least common, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, non-Hispanic; third least common, Black, non-Hispanic, and most common, White, non-Hispanic.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-AOI240040"><title>Cohort Selection</title><p>We defined a cohort of Massachusetts residents with incident OUD using <italic toggle="yes">International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)</italic> diagnosis codes for insurance claims submitted to the Massachusetts APCD and Acute Care Hospital Case Mix files (eTables 1 and 2 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). We included adults aged 18 to 63 years to exclude children and individuals who would become eligible for Medicare during follow-up. We defined an incident diagnosis as those without a diagnosis or OUD-related claim in the previous 180 days. Because most individuals with OUD in Massachusetts are insured by either Medicaid or commercial insurers (80.1% during the study timeframe), we focused on these 2 types of insurance at the time of diagnosis. The primary cohort included individuals diagnosed between July 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, with follow-up through December 31, 2015. At the start of 2016, APCD reporting requirements were removed for self-funded employer plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. These changes resulted in an abrupt 27% decrease in commercial claims submitted to the APCD in early 2016, which stabilized after the start of the year.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> To minimize this change in reporting requirements in our estimates, we excluded individuals with incident diagnoses after 2014 and restricted our follow-up period to 2015.</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-AOI240040"><title>Exposures and Outcomes</title><p>The exposure of interest was having commercial or Medicaid insurance at the time of diagnosis. Our main outcome of interest was the incidence of insurance transitions in the 12 months after diagnosis. Incident insurance transition was defined as any transition away from baseline insurance type at time of diagnosis (either Medicaid or commercial) into a different insurance type or having no reported insurance during follow-up. We used the Massachusetts APCD to classify mutually exclusive insurance types each month. Our secondary outcome was the type of insurance transition experienced. While individuals were restricted to having commercial or Medicaid insurance at the time of diagnosis, they could transition to any insurance type, including commercial (from Medicaid), Medicaid (from commercial), Medicare Advantage, Emergency Medicaid/other (including Veterans Affairs and worker&#8217;s compensation), or uninsured/missing. The uninsured/missing category includes individuals who became uninsured, switched to an insurer that does not report to the APCD (eg, fee-for-service Medicare), moved out of state, died, or became incarcerated. We lacked data on the components of the missing category except for death and incarceration.</p><p>To characterize the study cohort, we abstracted the following information at the time of diagnosis: age category (aged 18-25, 26-34, 35-44, and 45-63 years); sex; race and ethnicity (with categories as given in the Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse as Asian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, missing); pregnancy status (yes/no); number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the 180 days prior to diagnosis (0, 1, 2, &#8805;3); incarceration in the 180 days prior to diagnosis (yes/no); whether an individual experienced an opioid overdose in the 180 days prior to diagnosis (yes/no); and whether they started MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) in the 30 days after diagnosis (yes/no).

First, because individuals may lose insurance temporarily due to lapses in paperwork, we performed additional analyses where we allowed individuals to transition from their baseline insurance to the uninsured/missing category for a month, and then return to their baseline insurance without counting it as an insurance transition. Using this 2-month definition, we recalculated the unadjusted cumulative incidence of insurance transitions and the types of insurance transitions that occurred. Second, to clarify whether individuals who transitioned to the uninsured/missing category later regain insurance, we calculated the frequency with which these individuals transitioned back to another insurance category by the end of 12-month follow-up. Third, to assess how insurance transitions may have changed over time, we expanded the cohort to use more recent data, including individuals diagnosed with OUD from July 2014 to March 2019 (with follow-up through March 2020). In this expanded cohort, we excluded individuals diagnosed with OUD in 2015 whose follow-up would have spanned the time when APCD reporting requirements changed. Fourth, to help contextualize the insurance transition patterns in patients with OUD, we compared insurance transition incidence and estimated probabilities to a propensity score&#8211;matched cohort of individuals with an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), another chronic condition requiring routine visits and consistent medication.</p><p>All analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Edition software version 3.81 (SAS Institute Inc) and took place from November 10, 2022, to May 6, 2024.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-AOI240040"><title>Results</title><sec id="H2-6-AOI240040"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>There were 20&#8201;768 individuals diagnosed with incident OUD between July 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014 (<xref rid="aoi240040t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).

In analyses tracking individuals who entered the uninsured/missing category, 74.6% of those with commercial insurance at diagnosis remained uninsured/missing throughout follow-up while 20.5% returned to a commercial plan (eTable 5 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). For those with Medicaid, 47.7% remained uninsured/missing throughout follow-up, and 49.6% reenrolled in Medicaid.</p><p>Using the expanded cohort with data from July 2014 through March 2020 resulted in lower 12-month rates of insurance transitions for patients with Medicaid (28.3%) and higher rates for patients with commercial insurance (34.0%) (eTable 6 and eTable 7 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). The estimated probabilities of insurance transitions in this expanded cohort showed patterns similar to the main analyses (eTable 8 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the propensity score&#8211;matched cohorts of patients with OUD or T2D, rates of insurance transitions were higher for patients with OUD than T2D, particularly for those with commercial insurance (eTable 9, eTable 10, and eFigure 3 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). For patients covered by Medicaid at baseline, 28.3% of individuals with OUD experienced an insurance transition compared with 25.3% of individuals with T2D (eTable 10 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). For patients with commercial insurance at baseline, 26.8% of patients with OUD experienced an insurance transition compared with 17.5% with T2D. The estimated probabilities of insurance transitions by sociodemographic factors also differed by diagnosis (eTable 11 in <xref rid="note-AOI240040-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-AOI240040"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study using longitudinal individual-level data, individuals with OUD had high rates of insurance transitions in the 12 months after their diagnosis. Nearly one-third of individuals experienced an insurance transition, with particularly high rates of transition among young individuals and among individuals with commercial insurance who were Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic. Rates were slightly higher in Medicaid compared with commercial insurance although some Medicaid transitions appeared to be brief interruptions with rapid reenrollment.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate insurance instability in individuals with newly diagnosed OUD. While not directly comparable, Nguyen et al<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> previously found high rates (24.8%) of insurance disenrollment among patients with OUD actively receiving treatment with buprenorphine in an integrated health insurance and delivery system. The rates of insurance transition among patients with OUD appear to be higher than in the general population in Massachusetts, where an estimated 26% of individuals switched insurers over a 2-year period.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> They are also higher than insurance transition rates for individuals with schizophrenia in Massachusetts, of whom 18.6% have at least 1 insurance transition per year.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>We found that insurance transitions for patients with OUD varied considerably by age and race and ethnicity. Younger individuals were most likely to experience insurance transitions whether in commercial insurance or Medicaid. Individuals aged 26 to 35 years with commercial insurance were at particularly high risk, perhaps due to less stable employment.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Similar age patterns have been observed in studies of pregnancy and psychosis.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In terms of race and ethnicity, Black non-Hispanic individuals with OUD covered by commercial insurance had a notably high rate of insurance transitions at 40.1% followed by Hispanic individuals at 33.6%. This finding is consistent with prior research about racial and ethnic inequities in insurance transitions in the peripartum period.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, differences were less pronounced for patients with OUD covered by Medicaid. Future research should investigate the clinical impact of insurance transitions among individuals with OUD, particularly among racially minoritized individuals who transition from commercial insurance at a substantially higher rate.</p><p>Related to treatment for OUD, we found that individuals with Medicaid were more likely to initiate MOUD at diagnosis compared with those with commercial insurance, although rates of treatment were low. Initiating MOUD had no effect on insurance transitions for those with commercial insurance but was associated with a 5.5% reduction in the probability of insurance transition for those receiving Medicaid. This may partly reflect differences between insurers in cost-sharing practices that could affect treatment retention,<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> although findings on this topic are mixed.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Our sensitivity analyses revealed several noteworthy findings. First, when altering our definition for insurance transition to allow for a 1-month lapse in insurance coverage, we found that the rates of insurance transitions decreased considerably for individuals covered by Medicaid but not by commercial insurance. We also found that nearly 50% of individuals with Medicaid who entered the uninsured/missing category reenrolled in Medicaid during the 12-month follow-up period (compared with only 20% of individuals with commercial insurance). This is consistent with known lapses in Medicaid enrollment due to annual eligibility redeterminations.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Whether these brief lapses or transitions in insurance interrupt addiction treatment is a question that merits further inquiry.</p><p>Second, when we included more contemporary data, the insurance transition rates appeared higher for patients with commercial insurance than for Medicaid. The increase in insurance transitions for those with commercial insurance may be due to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act&#8211;related changes in reporting requirements to the APCD.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The rate of insurance transitions in Medicaid was lower using more contemporary data (28.3% vs 30.7%), indicating that lapses in Medicaid insurance may have become less common over time.</p><p>Third, compared with a propensity score&#8211;matched cohort of patients with T2D, individuals with OUD had higher rates of insurance transitions, particularly for those with commercial insurance. The discrepancy in insurance transitions between individuals with OUD and T2D covered by commercial insurance may be associated with changes in employment associated with an OUD diagnosis. While changes in employment and insurance instability have been observed in other chronic conditions such as cancer,<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> employer-based insurance may be particularly difficult to maintain for individuals with OUD. Active OUD may interfere with the ability to perform job functions, and individuals may also face stigma from employers due to drug use and treatment with MOUD.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-10-AOI240040"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, our analysis focused on insurance categories rather than individual insurance plans. As such, our insurance transition rates may be underestimates, as we would not detect individuals switching between plans within the same category of insurance<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>; in addition, the uninsured/missing category represents a heterogenous group, and the data limited our ability to distinguish insurance loss from other sources of transition, such as moving out of state. Second, we lacked data on important insurance characteristics that likely affect the treatment implications of insurance switching, such as network breadth and medication benefits. Third, our data are from a single state that expanded Medicaid eligibility and has high rates of insurance coverage, which may not generalize to other states.<sup><xref rid="aoi240040r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240040r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Fourth, while we can track longitudinal transitions in insurance, we do not assess whether these transitions affect treatment episodes, including disrupting or expanding access to MOUD. Fifth, we used a 180-day lookback period to define incident OUD, which may have captured some prevalent cases for individuals with limited contact with the medical system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI240040"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this longitudinal analysis of patients with newly diagnosed OUD, high rates of insurance transitions in the year after diagnosis, with differences by insurance type and by age and race and ethnicity were found. Given that insurance transitions may result in changes or loss of insurance coverage for highly efficacious medications for OUD, tracking changes in treatment outcomes related to insurance instability in this population is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI240040"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi240040r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wherry</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Early coverage, access, utilization, and health effects associated with the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions: a quasi-experimental study</article-title>. <source>Ann Intern Med</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>164</volume>(<issue>12</issue>):<fpage>795</fpage>-<lpage>803</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7326/M15-2234</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27088438</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC5021068</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="aoi240040r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Myerson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wherry</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Medicaid expansion increased preconception health counseling, folic acid intake, and postpartum contraception</article-title>. <source>Health Aff (Millwood)</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>39</volume>(<issue>11</issue>):<fpage>1883</fpage>-<lpage>1890</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00106</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33136489</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC7688246</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="aoi240040r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Soni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wherry</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>KI</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>How have ACA insurance expansions affected health outcomes? findings from the literature</article-title>. <source>Health Aff (Millwood)</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>39</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>371</fpage>-<lpage>378</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1377/hlthaff.2019.01436</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32119632</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="aoi240040r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Woolhandler</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Himmelstein</surname><given-names>DU</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>The relationship of health insurance and mortality: is lack of insurance deadly?</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source>. <year>2017</year>;<volume>167</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>424</fpage>-<lpage>431</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7326/M17-1403</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28655034</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="aoi240040r5"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Sommers</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Baicker</surname><given-names>K</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Mortality and access to care among adults after state Medicaid expansions</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>367</volume>(<issue>11</issue>):<fpage>1025</fpage>-<lpage>1034</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJMsa1202099</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22830435</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="aoi240040r6"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>DeLeire</surname><given-names>T</given-names></string-name></person-group>.
