In recent years, several initiatives have targeted the reduction or elimination of low-value practices in healthcare. Research suggests that passive interventions, such as the publication of guidelines, are often not sufficient to change behaviour and that active change interventions - interventions which actively implement strategies to change practices - are required to effect significant, sustained practice change. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and characterise studies of active change interventions designed to reduce or eliminate low-value healthcare practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We will conduct a review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases from inception. Building on previous research, 40 key terms will be used to search literature. The screening process will be conducted separately by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Empirical studies of active change interventions used to reduce or eliminate low-value practices will be included. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis will be used to categorise the characteristics of the studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval is not required for this study. This scoping review will provide insights into the impact of several characteristics of active change interventions, including the number of interventions (single-faceted or multifaceted) and the level of implementation (individual or organisational). These results can provide guidance and direction for future research in de-implementation. The results will be disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences and the publication of a manuscript.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>low-value</kwd><kwd>de-implement</kwd><kwd>de-adopt</kwd><kwd>choosing wisely</kwd><kwd>scoping review</kwd><kwd>active change intervention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The search strategy developed for this review is comprehensive and built on an extensive review of the&#160;literature.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A scoping review, focusing on the use of active change interventions, will offer broad, comprehensive and timely knowledge to this important field of research.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only English&#160;language studies will be included in this review.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although this review will focus on empirical studies, the included studies will not be appraised for quality.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The reduction of low-value healthcare practices is necessary to ensure patient safety and satisfaction, reduce costs and develop a sustainable healthcare system.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It is estimated that 30% of current healthcare dollars are spent on unnecessary, wasteful or harmful tests, procedures and medications.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Awareness has increased regarding the prevalence of low-value care&#8212;unnecessary and potentially harmful healthcare practices&#8212;and the high frequency with which these practices are used.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> In recent years, a number of campaigns have been launched, such as the&#160;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK and the international Choosing Wisely campaigns, which seek to identify and address the prevalence of low-value practices. Prior to these campaigns, healthcare providers struggled to identify low-value practices. The launches of the Choosing Wisely campaigns have significantly changed the landscape of research studies on reducing low-value practices. Gnjidic and Elshaug note that, as a result of the Choosing Wisely campaigns, research efforts to identify and prioritise low-value practices have increased exponentially and far exceed efforts to evaluate the efficacy of clinical and policy initiatives to reduce these practices.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>There is debate in the literature regarding the optimal characteristics of interventions to reduce or eliminate low-value healthcare practices.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#8211;4 6&#8211;9</xref> Some researchers regard de-implementation or de-adoption as the reverse of implementation or adoption,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7 10</xref> and decry the dearth of knowledge translation strategies and tools included in current efforts to de-implement low-value practices, advocating that implementation and de-implementation should both be part of the same agenda. Others argue that the complexities involved in reversing the&#160;often long-standing practices are unique and can be complicated by habituation, egos and inertia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;14</xref> Authors have also noted that traditional fee-for-service remuneration systems provide perverse incentives for overutilisation of procedures and medications and may add to the complexity of efforts to de-implement certain practices.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13 15</xref> Numerous researchers have called for increased attention to understanding the process of de-implementation and determining the most effective and efficient strategies to create and sustain this type of practice change.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#8211;18</xref>
</p><p>In addition,&#160;a number of&#160;reviews of systematic reviews offer mixed results regarding the efficacy and efficiency of interventions designed to change healthcare provider behaviours. Lau <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> report that multifaceted interventions are no more, or slightly more, effective at changing practices than single interventions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Squires <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> also report that multifaceted interventions are not more effective than single component interventions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Both studies advocate for more research to develop a theoretical base for intervention selection or development and for tailoring interventions based on identified barriers and facilitators to increase their effectiveness. Recent research on the use of tailored interventions&#8212;that is, interventions that are explicitly planned taking into account identified barriers to change&#8212;to change healthcare practices note the promise of this type of intervention, but report that results are small and more research is needed.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Other researchers advocate the use of behaviour change techniques when developing and implementing practice change interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 21 23</xref> These studies conclude that the&#160;results on the efficacy of various types and modes of interventions to change healthcare provider behaviour are inconclusive and that further research is needed.</p><p>This review seeks to address some of the gaps in knowledge of interventions to facilitate de-implementation. Specifically, we will focus on the use of active change interventions: interventions which actively implement strategies to change practices.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We have selected this focus since numerous studies have found that recommendations or guidelines alone&#8212;that&#160;is, more passive implementation approaches&#8212;are insufficient to change healthcare provider behaviour.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 19 24&#8211;26</xref> Rosenberg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> published a study in 2015 on the early trends for seven Choosing Wisely recommendations and concluded that the recommendations were not enough to produce major changes in practice and active interventions, such as data feedback, communications training, financial incentives and systems-level interventions, are needed.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>The science of de-implementation is a new and emerging field and little research has been conducted on this topic. In 2015, Niven <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> published a scoping review, which provided an examination of all aspects of the de-implementation literature.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The scoping review by Niven <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> offers valuable insight into the issues arising from a lack of focused terminology, and offered a synthesis model, based on the Knowledge-to-Action framework, for facilitating de-adoption. In 2017, Colla <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> published a systematic review of interventions used to reduce low-value healthcare services. This review found that multicomponent interventions targeted at both patients and providers have the most potential to reduce low-value care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The authors identified clinical decision support and performance feedback as promising, evidence-based interventions for this type of practice change. The review also identified that education, alone or as part of a complex intervention, was able to affect practice. Colla <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> advocate&#160;an evidence-based approach to reducing low-value care, one&#160;which engages with clinicians and patients and considers the context of the system where the intervention is being implemented.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This review will build on the findings of these previous&#160;reviews and expand the breadth and scope of the knowledge base of this important area of healthcare practice. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and synthesise the research on active change interventions used to reduce or eliminate low-value practices in healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A scoping review was selected for this study as the field of de-implementation research is relatively new and little is known about how this type of practice change is being approached, executed and studied.

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and a preliminary scan of relevant literature. Niven <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> found that &#8216;disinvest*&#8217; was the most common term used in their sample, but advocated the terms &#8216;de-adoption&#8217; and &#8216;de-implementation&#8217; to brand the process of reducing or eliminating low-value healthcare practices as they felt these terms had a more general connotation, and are natural antonyms of adoption and implementation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The preliminary scan of the literature for this review revealed that a significant proportion of de- implementation studies conducted since 2012 referenced the Choosing Wisely Initiative and/or used the term &#8216;low-value&#8217;; therefore, these terms were added to the search criteria.</p><p>The 40 search terms, listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> above, were selected to maximise the search capability to facilitate a broad and comprehensive search for this review.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Terms for database searches</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concept</td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Search terms</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">inappropriat* or overus* or unnecessary or ineffective or misus* or &#8216;do not do&#8217; or low-value or &#8216;low value&#8217; or obsole*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Action</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">reallocat* or relinquish* or re-apprais* or re-prioritiz* or redeploy* or revers* or decommission or declin* or delist* or abandon* or reassess* or replac* or disadopt* or defund* or de-adopt* or deadopt* or de-implement* or deimplement* or disinvest* or decreas* or discontinu* or withdraw* or stop* or reduc*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Venue</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">healthcare or &#8216;health&#160;care&#8217; or technolog* or device* or intervention* or health practi?e or medical or procedur* or drug* or medication*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR &#8216;choosing wisely&#8217;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition to database searches, we will conduct searches of grey literature, reference lists, Google, websites of relevant healthcare associations and hand searches.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
