prescribed postoperatively. Studies have shown that such legislation is
successful in reducing the morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) prescribed
after certain orthopaedic procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>(1) To determine if the opioid prescription&#8211;limiting legislation in Ohio
reduced the cumulative MMEs prescribed after hip arthroscopy without
significantly affecting the rates of emergency department (ED) visits,
hospital readmissions, and reoperations within 90 days postoperatively, and
(2) to assess risk factors associated with increased postoperative opioid
dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included patients who underwent primary and revision hip
arthroscopy at a single institution over a 4-year period. The prelegislation
(PRE) and postlegislation (POST) groups were defined as patients who
underwent surgery before August 31, 2017, and on/after this date,
respectively. The Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System was queried for
controlled-substance prescriptions from 30 days preoperatively to 90 days
postoperatively, and patient medical records were reviewed to collect
demographic, medical, surgical, and readmission data. Inverse probability
weighting&#8211;adjusted mean treatment effect regression models were used to
measure the difference in mean outcomes between the PRE and POST
cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 546 patients (228 PRE, 318 POST) were identified. There was a 25%
reduction in the cumulative MMEs prescribed to the POST group as compared
with the PRE group during the first 90 days postoperatively (840 vs 1125
MME, respectively; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01). The legislation was
associated with a significant decrease in the cumulative MMEs prescribed in
the first 90 postoperative days (mean treatment effect = &#8211;280.6;
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01), and there were no significant
between-group differences in the frequency of ED encounters (8.8% PRE, 11.6%
POST; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .32), hospital readmissions (1.3% PRE, 0.9% POST;
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .70), or reoperations (0.9% PRE, 0.6% POST;
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#8805; .99) during this period. Preoperative opioid use
was a significant independent risk factor for increased cumulative MMEs in
the first 90 days postoperatively (&#946; = 275; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt;
.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Opioid prescription&#8211;limiting legislation in Ohio was associated with
significant reductions in opioid MMEs dosing in the 90-day period following
hip arthroscopy. This legislation had no significant effect on ED
utilization, hospital readmissions, or reoperations within the same period.
Preoperative opioid use was a significant risk factor for increased MME
dosing after hip arthroscopy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hip arthroscopy</kwd><kwd>femoroacetabular impingement</kwd><kwd>opioids</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Approximately 25 million people used opioid pain medications for nonmedical purposes
between 2002 and 2011 in the United States alone.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> This upward trend in consumption has led to an increase in the rate of fatal
opioid overdoses, opioid-related emergency department (ED) encounters, and admissions to
substance abuse treatment programs.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> Policy makers within the United States have instituted reasonable prescriber
practice changes in many states to reduce the number of circulating opioids. In 2016,
Massachusetts became the first state to pass such legislation, and Ohio passed its
opioid prescription&#8211;limiting legislation on August 31, 2017.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> This law went into effect immediately after its passage. In Ohio, this
legislation states that opioid prescriptions for acute pain (eg, acute postoperative
pain) cannot be written for &gt;7 days for adults and that the maximum dose per day
cannot exceed 30 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). Earlier studies from various
states have shown that opioid-limiting legislation has been largely successful in
reducing the amount of opioids that are prescribed after certain orthopaedic
procedures.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr18-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Although opioid-prescribing legislation has been successful in reducing the amount of
opioids that are prescribed postoperatively, the effect of such policy on prescription
practices and rates of ED utilization, reoperations, and readmissions after hip
arthroscopy is currently unknown. It is important to ascertain this effect for numerous
reasons. First, patients aged 20 to 39 years are the most common group to undergo hip
arthroscopy, and they have the highest reported rate of illicit drug use.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Second, in the postoperative
period, patients who undergo hip arthroscopy require substantial levels of opioid
medications despite advances in regional and general anesthesia.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Third, studies have shown that
increased opioid consumption postoperatively is associated with worse outcomes after hip
arthroscopy.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
Finally, the most common reason for ED utilization after hip arthroscopy is inadequate
pain control.<sup>

</sup></p><p>The purpose of this study was 2-fold. The primary purpose was to determine if the opioid
prescription&#8211;limiting legislation in Ohio reduces the cumulative MMEs prescribed after
hip arthroscopy without significantly affecting the rates of ED utilization, hospital
readmissions, and reoperations within 90 days postoperatively. The secondary purpose was
to assess risk factors associated with increasing opioid dosing postoperatively.</p><sec id="section1-23259671231162340"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="section2-23259671231162340"><title>Design and Data Collection</title><p>Before any data collection, approval for the study was obtained from the
institutional review board and the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy. This
retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent primary and revision
hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome from January 2016 to
February 2019 at a single academic tertiary referral center. Patients were
identified using an institutional database. Patients were excluded from the
final analysis if they carried a diagnosis of hip dysplasia preoperatively and
underwent open surgery in conjunction with hip arthroscopy to correct the
underlying dysplasia. The remainder of the patients were included.</p><p>Patients were categorized into 1 of 2 cohorts based on their dates of surgery.
Those who underwent hip arthroscopy before August 31, 2017, (the date when the
Ohio law was passed) were placed into the prelegislation (PRE) cohort while
patients who underwent surgery on or after that date were placed into the
postlegislation (POST) cohort. Patients were also classified as either
<italic toggle="yes">opioid na&#239;ve</italic> if they did not have an opioid prescription
written within 30 days before surgery or <italic toggle="yes">opioid tolerant</italic> if
they had &#8805;1 opioid prescriptions written within 30 days before surgery. The
electronic medical record of each patient was reviewed to collect demographic,
medical, surgical, and readmission data. Operative duration was not collected,
as it has not been significantly associated with higher postoperative opioid usage.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup></p><p>A query was performed of the Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System (OARRS), the
State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy&#8217;s prescription drug monitoring program. OARRS is
a 5-year rolling database, and data before the 5-year period are expunged from
the system daily. Data from OARRS provided by the State of Ohio Board of
Pharmacy were deidentified. Controlled-substance prescription data were obtained
for all patients from 30 days before surgery to 90 days postoperatively.
Information was obtained regarding the type and dose of oral opioid (eg,
oxycodone, tramadol, hydrocodone), the number of prescriptions, and the number
of pills per prescription. To account for the relative potency of each type of
opioid, the dose (in mg) was converted into MMEs using the following multipliers<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup>: oxycodone, &#215;1.5; tramadol, &#215;0.1; and hydromorphone, &#215;4. No multipliers
were applied to morphine or hydrocodone. The new dosing value was multiplied by
the number of tablets within each prescription to obtain the MME for the
prescription. The cumulative MMEs were calculated as the sum of the MMEs for
each prescription prescribed in the following postoperative periods: immediate
(ie, first 7 days), 0 to 30 days, 31 to 60 days, and 61 to 90 days. In addition,
we collected data regarding prescriptions of benzodiazepine (eg, diazepam,
alprazolam) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog (eg, gabapentin,
pregabalin) that were prescribed within 30 days before surgery. In our practice,
postoperative pain prescriptions are written postoperatively and before
discharge from the ambulatory surgical center.</p><p>The data within OARRS are limited to the dates that prescriptions were
written/filled and the MME of the entire prescription (if the prescription is
for an opioid). The database does not provide insight into the actual
consumption habits of the patient. However, we believe that quantifying the
number of prescriptions filled and the MME within each prescription serves as a
valid proxy for opioid consumption because only 33% of patients dispose of their
unused opioid medication.<sup>

</sup></p></sec><sec id="section3-23259671231162340"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Demographic and comorbidity data were presented using median and interquartile
range for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. Some
of the covariates of interest were reorganized for meaningful interpretation of
regression coefficients. The MMEs in the immediate, 0- to 30-day, 31- to 60-day,
and 61- to 90-day postoperative periods were compared between the PRE and POST
periods. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to distinguish intracohort
differences for preoperative opioid tolerance status, as well as the PRE and
POST cohorts. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test was applied
to assess the impact of preoperative opioid tolerance status and
legislation.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the opioid legislation itself, inverse probability
weighting&#8211;adjusted mean treatment effect (ATE) regression models were fitted to
correct the imbalance in the distributions of the demographic characteristics
and surgical procedures on the potential outcomes in the PRE and POST periods.
The ATE measured the difference in mean outcomes between the PRE and POST
cohorts. To obtain the ATE estimates, a logistic regression model was first
fitted for the PRE group versus the POST group. Demographic characteristics and
surgical procedures were included in the logistic model to generate propensity
scores. Then the inverse of the propensity scores was used to estimate an
inverse probability weighting estimator. Inverse probability weighting&#8211;adjusted
regression allowed the creation of 2 pseudo-populations with similar baseline
clinical characteristics, which can be used to compare the outcomes of 2 groups.
We conducted an imbalance check of the propensity score models and evaluated the
distribution of the propensity scores to ensure that no outliers were
presented.</p><p>Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors
for increased opioid prescribing postoperatively. These multivariate regression
analyses included preoperative opioid exposure and the number of GABA analog and
benzodiazepine prescriptions. We could not include demographic factors in the
multivariate analyses, as the opioid data from the State of Ohio Board of
Pharmacy are completely deidentified. Because of the skewness in the MME data
distribution, a quantile regression analysis was applied to MME consumption up
to the first 30-day postoperative period and MME dosing in the 0- to 90-day
postoperative period. As the result of the zero-inflated nature of prolonged
opioid use in the 30- to 90-day postoperative period, we dichotomized this
outcome variable. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to assess
factors related to chronic opioid use. In all regression models, the effects of
covariates on the outcome variables were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,
and legislation. All tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was
defined as <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05. Statistical analyses were performed

associated with significant reductions in cumulative MMEs prescribed after hip
arthroscopy without significantly affecting the rates of ED utilization, hospital
readmissions, and reoperations. In this study, we found significant reductions of
25% and 29% in cumulative MMEs prescribed in the immediate (ie, 0-7 days) and 0- to
30-day postoperative periods, respectively, when comparing the PRE and POST cohorts.
A significant decrease was also observed in cumulative MMEs prescribed in the 0- to
90-day postoperative period between the PRE and POST cohorts. However, this
reduction was largely attributed to that observed at postoperative 0 to 30 days, as
there were no significant differences between the cohorts in cumulative MMEs
prescribed at 31 to 60 days and 61 to 90 days. When we accounted for preoperative
opioid tolerance, it was apparent that the opioid-tolerant cohort was prescribed
more opioids than its opioid-na&#239;ve counterparts throughout the postoperative
period.</p><p>Our finding that opioid-limiting legislation significantly reduces the cumulative
MMEs prescribed after hip arthroscopy is congruent with previously published
studies. In a series of retrospective studies, Reid et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr17-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and Shah et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that similar opioid-limiting legislation in Rhode Island was
associated with a significant reduction in cumulative MMEs prescribed after an array
of orthopaedic procedures, including shoulder and knee arthroscopy, lumbar spine
surgery, total joint arthroplasty, and open reduction and internal fixation of
distal radius and ankle fractures.</p><p>Furthermore, our findings reinforce the well-established relationship between
preoperative opioid tolerance and increased prescribing and/or usage of opioids
postoperatively. In a retrospective review of a private insurance database, Anciano
Granadillo et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that the most significant predictor for prolonged opioid use
after hip arthroscopy was preoperative opioid use. Likewise, Cunningham et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> revealed that any opioid use 2 weeks before surgery was the strongest
predictor of opioid use after hip arthroscopy. Finally, Degen et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> showed that the risk of persistent opioid use (ie, &#8805;2 prescriptions filled
between 9 and 15 months postoperatively) was greatest in patients who used opioids
within 1 year before hip arthroscopy. The relationship between preoperative and
increased postoperative opioid consumption is generalizable beyond hip arthroscopy
as well. In a retrospective review of 1384 patients undergoing primary total hip or
total knee arthroplasty, Benfield et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-23259671231162340" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> illustrated that patients with a history of &#8220;opioid abuse&#8221; received 24.88
MMEs per day more postoperatively when compared with patients without such a
history.</p><sec id="section11-23259671231162340"><title>Limitations</title><p>The outcomes of this study must be interpreted within its limitations. First,
this study examined findings from a single academic institution and tertiary
referral center, which potentially limits the generalizability of the results.
However, surgical residents, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners
practicing under the attending surgeons frequently prescribe opioids for acute
postoperative pain. Thus, this study highlights the effect of opioid-limiting
legislation on the opioid-prescribing practices of many providers. In addition,
the findings of this study are consistent with previously published studies. A
second limitation is that the OARRS is a 5-year rolling database in which data
before the 5-year period are automatically deleted. This ultimately limited the
size of our patient population, specifically the PRE cohort.</p><p>Third, we did not control for the type of anesthesia that was used during
surgery, whether postoperative nerve blocks were utilized, and the use of
nonopioid pain medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) on
postoperative opioid-prescribing practices. Fourth, it is possible that the
reduction in opioid prescriptions seen in this study and similar studies is not
completely attributed to the opioid-limiting legislation, because provider
awareness of the opioid epidemic had greatly increased during the same
period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-23259671231162340"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Opioid prescription&#8211;limiting legislation in Ohio was associated with significant
reductions in opioid MME dosing in the 90-day postoperative period after hip
arthroscopy. These reductions were most pronounced in the first 7 days and first 30
days after surgery. This legislation had no significant effect on ED utilization,
hospital readmissions, or reoperations within 90 days postoperatively. Preoperative
opioid use was a significant risk factor for increased MME dosing after hip
arthroscopy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-23259671231162340"><p>Final revision submitted December 19, 2022; accepted January 20, 2023.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn2-23259671231162340"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of
