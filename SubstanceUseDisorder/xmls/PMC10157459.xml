Buprenorphine and naloxone (BUP and NAL) can reduce opioid overdose deaths, decrease misuse, and improve quality of life. Unfortunately, poor medication adherence is a primary barrier to the long-term efficacy of BUP and NAL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>We aimed to examine patient feedback on current and potential features of a Bluetooth-enabled pill bottle cap and associated mobile app for patients prescribed BUP and NAL for an opioid use disorder, and to solicit recommendations for improvement to effectively and appropriately tailor the technology for people in treatment for opioid use disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A convenience sample of patients at an opioid use disorder outpatient clinic were asked about medication adherence, opioid cravings, experience with technology, motivation for treatment, and their existent support system through a brief e-survey. Patients also provided detailed feedback on current features and features being considered for inclusion in a technology designed to increase medication adherence (eg, inclusion of a personal motivational factor, craving and stress tracking, incentives, and web-based coaching). Participants were asked to provide suggestions for improvement and considerations specifically applicable to people in treatment for opioid use disorder with BUP and NAL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty people with an opioid use disorder who were prescribed BUP and NAL participated (mean age 34, SD 8.67 years; 65% female; 80% White). Participants selected the most useful, second-most useful, and least useful features presented; 42.1% of them indicated that motivational reminders would be most useful, followed by craving and stress tracking (26.3%) and web-based support forums (21.1%). Every participant indicated that they had at least 1 strong motivating factor for staying in treatment, and half (n=10) indicated children as that factor. All participants indicated that they had, at some point in their lives, the most extreme craving a person could have; however, 42.1% indicated that they had no cravings in the last month. Most respondents (73.7%) stated that tracking cravings would be helpful. Most respondents (84.2%) also indicated that they believed reinforcers or prizes would help them achieve their treatment goals. Additionally, 94.7% of respondents approved of adherence tracking to accommodate this feature using smart packaging, and 78.9% of them approved of selfie videos of them taking their medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Engaging patients taking treatment for opioid use disorder with BUP and NAL allowed us to identify preferences and considerations that are unique to this treatment area.

Intravenous opioid use increases the risk of contracting blood-borne illnesses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Buprenorphine and naloxone (BUP and NAL) can reduce opioid overdose deaths by at least 70%, decrease opioid misuse, and improve quality of life [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Because of its demonstrated efficacy, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry endorse the use of medications for opioid use disorder in the treatment of opioid use disorder (eg, BUP and NAL and methadone).</p></sec><sec><title>Medication Adherence</title><p>One of the most substantial barriers to the long-term efficacy of BUP and NAL and poor medication adherence is consistently associated with relapse and overdose risk, as well as several other negative outcomes for patients [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a study of 703 patients examining the effect of BUP adherence on opioid relapse, patients who were nonadherent to their prescribed BUP were over 10 times more likely to relapse than patients who were adherent [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Poor medication adherence can occur for myriad reasons, as summarized by the World Health Organization&#8217;s Five Dimensions of Adherence: social and economic, health care system, condition-related, therapy-related, and patient-related [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At the patient level, age, perception of treatment, co-occurring psychiatric conditions, and environment (eg, living with other substance users or at a distance from treatment centers) are common causes for treatment discontinuation [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, a previous study found that 73% of patients in treatment for an opioid use disorder, with co-occurring symptoms of depression, maintained abstinence at 6 months of treatment. Of those who had combined symptoms of depression and anxiety, only 40% were abstinent in the same time period [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Anxiety is a predictive factor for additional psychopathologies, such as insomnia and sleep deprivation, which can, in turn, manifest into symptoms of anxiety and depression [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, a poor therapeutic alliance between patient and provider and lack of prescription monitoring may contribute to patient nonadherence, in part due to limited tools at the level of the prescribing clinician [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nonadherence with BUP and NAL is frequently associated with an increased risk of diversion [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given that BUP and NAL is a schedule III opioid medication, improving the management of adherence is critical to decreasing relapse, diversion, and overdose.</p></sec><sec><title>Pillsy Technology</title><p>Pillsy, which has successfully and significantly increased adherence in other treatment areas, acts like a digital medication coach, providing reminders using a mobile app, text messages, and automated phone calls [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The platform automatically tracks doses and timing and sends intelligent reminders to create a unique feedback loop, which allows the developers to constantly optimize incentive or reminder messages to meet user needs and increase adherence. The Pillsy technology was developed to be a simple, inexpensive adjunct to standard treatment. Unlike some other technologies, such as the <italic toggle="yes">MySafeRx</italic> system [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the Pillsy system does not require codes or video calls for the patient to access their medication. Still, other technologies, such as reSET-O by Pear Therapeutics, have integrated an intensive behavioral intervention into their platform [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Pillsy was designed intentionally without these requirements in an effort not to increase the patient burden, and to begin work with people with opioid use disorder using a simple platform that could be adjusted to specifically include features that were requested by patients to increase the practical usability of the product.</p><p>Considering the evidence that tracking medication intakes and maintaining a high motivation with prompts are effective in the intervention phase of adherence up to persistence and considering that Pillsy only nominally increases the cost of oral BUP and NAL treatment and providers can bill for monitoring time (CPT code 99091), it is a potentially attractive solution to patients, providers, and payers. However, there are no studies available that have systematically investigated this technology&#8217;s impact on medication adherence in this population. The device is under investigation in a small (ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04656899">NCT04656899</ext-link>, n=40, 12 weeks) clinical trial that recently completed data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>This Study</title><p>The intent of this investigation was to examine patient feedback regarding the acceptability and feasibility of an inexpensive Bluetooth-enabled pill bottle cap and associated mobile app (ie, Pillsy, an Optimize Health product) designed to monitor and increase BUP and NAL adherence with the assistance of a designated &#8220;helper&#8221; (eg, friend and family member). We gathered feedback from patients in BUP and NAL outpatient treatment on existing and potential features of the technology as well to solicit recommendations for improvement in an effort to tailor the technology most effectively and appropriately for people in opioid use disorder treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in the US states of Idaho and Washington.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria were being 18 years of age or older and receiving treatment for a substance use disorder at Ideal Option outpatient addiction medicine clinics. Patients at this clinic are on opioid substitution therapy. Participants may have begun receiving treatment at this clinic due to iatrogenic opioid dependency or heroin or fentanyl or other illicit opioid use prior to treatment induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>Study procedures were classified as exempt by the Washington State University institutional review board. Participants received a US $25 Walmart gift card (not usable for tobacco, alcohol, or firearms) for participating.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Participants were a convenience sample of people receiving medication-assisted treatment that were recruited through 2 Ideal Option clinics. Ideal Option is specialized in medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Clinic front desk staff invited patients to participate as they arrived at the clinics for their usual care appointments using a short script describing the study. All participants were invited while a study staff member was there. If a study staff member was not present at the clinic, people were not being invited to participate. All research was conducted in 1 appointment at the respective clinic in a private room. Hours for recruitment varied by day based on the researcher&#8217;s availability, and all data were gathered by 1 researcher. Recruitment was conducted from May 2021 through June 2021. Interested patients met with research staff at the clinic for an eligibility screening, consenting, and study completion in 1 session. Participants were not required to have a smartphone or computer to participate in this study. Researchers provided a laptop for participants to use to view screenshots of the Pillsy system and complete the survey for the study.</p><p>Survey questions were developed by the research team. Pilot testing on the items was conducted by members of the research lab conducting the study. All surveys were administered by the first author of the manuscript. Participants reported their demographics, medication adherence, diversion, opioid cravings, experience with technology, and support system, and provided suggestions on how to best support people taking BUP and NAL. This information was gathered through a series of closed and open-ended questions administered on the provided laptop, with free text boxes for open-ended questions. Researchers used scripts and screenshots to describe the Pillsy intervention and familiarize patients with it. Potential features under consideration were described verbally. Participants were asked to rate their interest in or opinion on current and potential features of the app, using response options such as &#8220;useful, second most useful, and least useful.&#8221; They were also asked to provide detailed feedback (eg, concerns and suggestions) on examples of product features being considered through open-text areas in the survey. Specific features evaluated included the inclusion of a personal motivational factor identified by the patient, craving tracking, web-based health coach access for the treatment of anxiety or stress, sleep and activity tracking, an online moderated forum, and incentives for optimal medication implementation. Data were collected using the Research Electronic Data Capture, a secure data collection tool. Participation in the study took approximately 30 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics (response frequencies and percentages) to characterize participant behavioral patterns and feedback.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 20 participants (N=20) were assessed for eligibility, and all met the inclusion criteria. One participant ended participation after demographics due to a childcare issue that required immediate presence, resulting in n=19 participants for the feedback portion of the study. Participant ages ranged from 20 to 53 (mean 34.15, SD 8.67) years. Participants were primarily White (80%, n=16), female (65%, n=13) and identified as women (65%, n=13). In total, 80% (n=16) of the sample indicated their race as White, and 95% (n=19) indicated non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean number of weeks participants had been in treatment at Ideal Option was 1.64 years (SD 86.19 weeks; range 1-261 weeks). The average number of times participants had been in treatment for opioid use disorder was 2.42 (SD 1.95; range 1-7 times).</p></sec><sec><title>Survey Responses</title><sec><title>Medication Adherence, Treatment Motivation, and Diversion</title><p>Participants were asked whether they had a strong motivating factor for staying in treatment and what that motivational factor was (see <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each participant indicated that they had at least 1 strong motivating factor, and 10 indicated children as that factor. When asked how easy or difficult it was to remember to take their medication doses, the majority (79%, n=15) indicated &#8220;easy&#8221; or &#8220;very easy,&#8221; and 42% (n=8) indicated that they did not miss doses, even occasionally. For those who did occasionally miss doses, the most frequent reason indicated was forgetting (88%, n=7), though people also indicated that they occasionally missed doses due to sleeping through the time when they were supposed to take it, being embarrassed to take it in public, or being in too much of a hurry.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="table1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Survey questions, response options, and descriptive results.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="1000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="30" span="1"/><col width="30" span="1"/><col width="800" span="1"/><col width="0" span="1"/><col width="140" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">Question and response options</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participants</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">

Concerns that were raised by participants included that this may make people feel guilty if they were not reaching their treatment goals and that it may trigger people to use illicit substances if the motivational factor was upsetting. One participant suggested that this may be more helpful for people who were &#8220;stronger in their sobriety.&#8221; Suggestions for improving this feature included diversifying ways to deliver motivation such as adding reinforcing complements when people were doing well, incorporating personalized motivational phrases that users could create, adding a picture of the motivational factor, adding a voice recording of the technology user saying the motivational factor, and including a counseling component such as letting the user know that they are loved and not being judged or bringing in a spiritual component and other positive factors in the person&#8217;s life.</p></sec><sec><title>Technology Use, Craving, Anxiety, and Stress Tracking</title><p>All participants had smartphones with unlimited texting and had used Bluetooth connectivity previously.

Personalized reminders that target incentives for sobriety, and avoid self-identified triggers for anxiety and cravings, could prove useful in improving the Pillsy technology. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive regarding a feature that would remind them of their self-selected motivational factor when it is time to take a medication dose. A feature providing reinforcers for consistently taking opioid use disorder medications was endorsed at greater than 80%. In addition, over 70% of participants indicated that tracking cravings would be helpful.</p><p>The results of this study support modifications to the Pillsy technology that would integrate additional motivational interventions to help promote medication adherence in people with opioid use disorder. First, strong support was present for the integration of personalized motivational factors, follow-up by the research team on suggestions made by participants to include phrases of encouragement and pictures of the family will be considered. Second, the integration of contingency management to provide tangible reinforcers for medication adherence will be considered, particularly, considering the efficacy of contingency management interventions in substance use treatment [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Our sample did not suggest additional safeguards such as required video check-ins or unique codes from their provider be added to the technology. This will continue to differentiate the Pillsy technology from other medication access technologies, such as <italic toggle="yes">MySafeRx</italic>. Our sample also did not request educational materials or behavioral interventions similar to those in the reSET-O technology, therefore continuing to differentiate Pillsy from Pear Therapeutics technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the sample for the study was a small (N=20) convenience sample that was geographically homogeneous (all participants received care within Idaho and Washington states in the United States), primarily White and largely female. Selection bias may be present, as participants were people who had time to engage in the study following their scheduled visit to the treatment clinic. Second, while the participants were given descriptions of how the technology being investigated functioned, they did not have the opportunity to interact with it.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Providing treatment adherence promotion through a digital Bluetooth-based smart pill cap and associated mobile app, like Pillsy, maybe a way to increase adherence and improve treatment outcomes for people in treatment for opioid use disorder using BUP and NAL. Including patient feedback and preferences in the development process is integral to creating a user-friendly, meaningful intervention that patients will use and find helpful. The valuable feedback provided through this study will allow the technology developers to modify the app based on this feedback, with the intention of creating a more patient-centered product.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts of Interest: SMM reports that Optimize Health, in the form of a sub-contract to his university, Washington State University, which originated from the National Institutes of Health.
