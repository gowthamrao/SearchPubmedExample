While the orthopedic community has long concentrated on the physical healing of such injuries, meticulously attending to bone realignment and restoration of function, the psychological aftermath of fractures, particularly the emergence of depressive disorders, has not received commensurate scrutiny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Emerging evidence suggests that the trauma associated with fractures can significantly increase the risk of developing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For instance, research conducted by Duggal found that 38 out of 101 hip fracture patients (approximately 37.6%) exhibited depressive symptoms as early as six weeks after their injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite these findings, the long-term psychological outcomes of such injuries remain underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a predictive model that can identify fracture patients at high risk of subsequent depression.</p><p id="Par10">Depression, as a pervasive global public health issue, manifests through persistent emotional despondency, anhedonia, and declines in cognitive and somatic functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Its prevalence among fracture patients compromises recovery trajectories, and quality of life, and places an increased economic burden on healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The complex etiology spans the immediate impacts of injury - pain intensity and immobilization - to the protracted demands of rehabilitation, chronic pain management, lifestyle disruptions, social isolation from physical dependence, and the psychological trauma itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, sociodemographic determinants like age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status increasingly demonstrate influential roles in modulating psychological outcomes post-injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">This study aims to develop a predictive model using clinical, laboratory, and psychosocial variables to forecast the risk of depression in the post-fracture context. Identifying at-risk individuals allows for timely psychological intervention alongside somatic treatment. Potential predictors include behavioral factors, socioeconomic status, medical comorbidities, and inflammatory markers.</p><p id="Par12">Through multivariate regression analysis on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) survey data, we evaluate each variable&#8217;s predictive strength to construct a comprehensive risk model for depression following fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Rather than facilitating fracture recovery, this model integrates biological, psychological, and social health dimensions to mitigate the mental health toll of fractures through earlier recognition and intervention for post-injury depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="Par13">This study utilized data from the NHANES, which consists of annual cross-sectional surveys spanning from 2005 to 2020. Each year&#8217;s survey provides a separate, nationally representative snapshot of the U.S. population. NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is an extensive and nationally representative survey aimed at assessing the health and nutritional status of community-dwelling, non-institutionalized adults and children throughout the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to the NHANES database being publicly available and having previously undergone ethical approval by the National Center for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board, our institutional review board (IRB) deemed that no additional ethical approval was required for its use in our study. The IRB recognized that the comprehensive ethical standards upheld by the NCHS, including the informed consent obtained from all participants and the anonymization of data, were sufficient to meet ethical guidelines for secondary data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Inclusion criteria for this study were strictly adhered to, encompassing only individuals from the 2005&#8211;2020 NHANES cohorts. Records lacking complete data or those from participants who declined to respond were systematically excluded. Instances of data sets exhibiting more than a 10% deficiency in information were also omitted. However, for subsets demonstrating minor missing data, multiple imputation techniques were employed to approximate the missing values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Eligibility for this study was further narrowed to participants who had completed both the fracture and depression questionnaire assessments. The fracture questionnaire specifically inquired, &#8220;Has a doctor ever diagnosed you with a broken or fractured wrist, hip, or spine?&#8220;. Besides, we selected participants based on the age they reported their significant fracture event and their responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) administered during the NHANES survey cycle. We inferred the temporal sequence by ensuring that the reported age at first fracture was less than the age at survey participation, thus allowing us to reasonably assume that the assessment of depressive symptoms occurred after the fracture event. Exclusion criteria was meticulously applied. Participants who had used any prescription medication for mental health conditions, specifically antidepressants or mood disorder treatments, in the month preceding the survey were excluded. This information was identified through responses to the NHANES survey question, &#8220;In the past month, have you used or taken medication for which a prescription is needed?&#8221; If the medication was related to mental health treatment, those participants were excluded. Following these stringent criteria, a total of 1,748 subjects were selected for the analysis, comprising 362 individuals diagnosed with depression and 1,386 without depression.</p><p id="Par15">For the external validation phase, a group of patients with fractures was collected from those visiting the Affiliated People&#8217;s Hospital of Ningbo University from June 2022 to November 2023. To ensure accurate patient profiling, these individuals were selected based on the same inclusion criteria as those used in the NHANES dataset, with an additional verification step. We meticulously reviewed the medical records from the day of hospital admission for each fracture to confirm that the patients did not have pre-existing conditions such as depression, ensuring the purity of the study sample. A total of 360 patients were enrolled for this phase. Their depression levels were subsequently assessed using the PHQ-9 as part of a cross-sectional survey conducted during routine medical appointments. These appointments, typically occurring more than 12 weeks post-fracture, included routine biochemical tests and provided an opportunity for a comprehensive health evaluation. The timing of over 12 weeks was strategically chosen based on clinical protocols, which allow for an initial physical recovery phase post-fracture. This delay helps to ensure that the assessment of the patient&#8217;s mental health is not influenced by immediate pain or acute stress factors, thus enabling a more accurate evaluation of depressive symptoms after sufficient recovery time. Ethical approval for this segment was obtained, bearing the approval code NBU2023007.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Depression symptoms</title><p id="Par16">The evaluation of depression within this study was meticulously carried out utilizing the PHQ-9. The PHQ-9 is a rigorously validated nine-item self-report instrument, specifically designed to screen for the presence and severity of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The scope of symptoms assessed includes, but is not limited to, persistent low mood, sleep disturbances, fatigue, changes in appetite, diminished self-esteem, difficulties in concentration, psychomotor retardation, and suicidal ideation, all within the fortnight preceding the assessment. Each question on the PHQ-9 utilizes a four-point Likert scale for scoring, from 0 to 3, with options labeled as 0 (&#8220;not at all&#8221;), 1 (&#8220;several days&#8221;), 2 (&#8220;more than half the days&#8221;), and 3 (&#8220;nearly every day&#8221;). Thus, the total PHQ-9 score ranges from 0 to 27 points.</p><p id="Par17">For the purposes of this investigation, the operational definition of depression was established with a threshold PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This demarcation was chosen to identify individuals with moderate to severe depressive symptomatology, ensuring the clinical relevance of the depression diagnoses within our study cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Variable selection and measurement</title><p id="Par18">In this study, a meticulous approach was adopted for data collection, focusing on a wide array of variables spanning demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical domains, enabling a comprehensive analysis of factors associated with depression within our study population. The demographic and socioeconomic variables captured include gender (female or male), age (in years), and race/ethnicity, which were categorized into Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and other races. Educational attainment was recorded across several levels: less than 9th grade, 9th to 11th grade, high school graduate, some college, and college graduate or above. Marital status was classified as married, widowed, divorced, separated, never married, or living with a partner. The poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), a key indicator of socioeconomic status, was calculated by dividing the household income by the poverty guidelines, which vary according to the survey year and state.</p><p id="Par19">Lifestyle and behavioral factors were meticulously documented with a specific focus on behaviors in the year preceding the depression assessment. Drinking status, categorized as either non-drinker or drinker, and smoking status, differentiated between non-smokers and smokers, were both assessed based on self-reported behaviors from the year before the depression survey was conducted. Similarly, physical activity levels and sedentary behaviors were evaluated based on conditions in the year prior to the depression assessment. Physical activity was assessed as a binary variable indicating engagement in any activities, while sedentary time was quantified as the average number of minutes per day spent sitting or reclining.</p><p id="Par20">The medical history and conditions evaluated comprised the presence of hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;90 mmHg), diabetes status (no diabetes, diabetic, or borderline), and self-reported physician diagnoses, which helped in identifying conditions such as asthma, anemia, overweight (Body mass index (BMI) between 25-29.9 kg/m&#178;), arthritis, congestive heart failure, congenital heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, liver conditions, thyroid problems, and malignancies. Osteoporosis and fracture history, detailing fracture type (wrist, hip, spine, mixed) and frequency (once or multiple times), were also ascertained, along with the daily use of cortisone medication (yes or no). We define &#8216;mixed&#8217; fractures as cases where individuals have sustained fractures at more than one of the listed sites.</p><p id="Par21">Anthropometric and biochemical indicators were thoroughly evaluated at the time of the depression assessment following the fracture. These indicators included BMI determined by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m^2). The extensive metabolic panel encompassed tests for basophils (1000 cells/uL), cadmium (nmol/L), lead (nmol/L), eosinophils (1000 cells/uL), lymphocytes (1000 cells/uL), monocytes (1000 cells/uL), neutrophils (1000 cells/uL), albumin (g/L), blood urea nitrogen (mmol/L), calcium (mmol/L), cholesterol (mmol/L), creatinine (&#181;mol/L), globulin (g/L), glucose (mg/dL), iron (&#181;mol/L), phosphorus (mmol/L), bilirubin (&#181;mol/L), total protein (g/L), triglycerides (mmol/L), uric acid (&#181;mol/L), and mercury (&#181;g/L). A full blood count with differential was conducted to assess various cellular components and their proportions, as well as red blood cell characteristics, including folate (ng/mL), hemoglobin (g/dL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (g/dL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (pg), mean corpuscular volume (fL), and red cell distribution width (%). Liver function tests assessed levels of alkaline phosphatase (U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (U/L), alanine aminotransferase (U/L), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (IU/L). Other evaluated biomarkers included bicarbonate (mmol/L), chloride (mmol/L), potassium (mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (IU/L), sodium (mmol/L), and osmolality (mOsm/kg).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par22">Continuous variables were summarized using the mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviation (SD) or the median with interquartile range (IQR), as appropriate.

The AUC for the training group was reported at 0.734 (95% CI: 0.700-0.768), while the validation group observed an AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.638&#8211;0.742). To refine the model, LASSO regression was employed to identify and retain only the five most impactful variables, resulting in a streamlined version of the model. The performance of this reduced model yielded an AUC of 0.723 (95% CI: 0.688&#8211;0.757) for the development cohort and 0.690 (95% CI: 0.638&#8211;0.742) for the validation cohort.

Consequently, we leveraged data from fracture patients in the NHANES database along with hospital-based cross-sectional studies to create and confirm the efficacy of nomogram-based risk scores aimed at forecasting the risk of post-fracture depression. It&#8217;s important to note that in our study, depression was assessed using the PHQ-9, which is a screening tool designed to identify high-risk individuals, not to confirm a definitive diagnosis. This distinction underscores the need to combine these initial screenings with thorough clinical evaluations for accurate diagnosis and treatment of depression in post-fracture patients. The intended use of our model is solely for screening purposes, to improve the understanding and management of psychological outcomes after traumatic injuries and to ensure appropriate clinical follow-up.</p><p id="Par41">Our investigation reveals that alcohol consumption is intricately linked with depression. The research underscores this relationship, demonstrating that individuals engaging in excessive alcohol use may experience a heightened risk of developing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As supported by Costardi et al., alcohol can act as a central nervous system depressant, exacerbating or contributing to the onset of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the relationship between alcohol use and depression is bidirectional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; individuals may turn to alcohol as a form of self-medication for depressive symptoms, which can lead to a cycle of dependence and worsen the mental health condition over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This finding suggests the need for integrated treatment approaches that address both alcohol use disorders and depression simultaneously, highlighting the importance of screening for depressive symptoms among individuals with a high level of alcohol consumption. Insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or non-restorative sleep, is another significant predictor of depression identified in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The link between insomnia and depression is well-documented, with sleep disturbances often preceding the onset of depressive episodes. Insomnia not only increases the risk for the development of depression but can also exacerbate the severity of existing depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The bidirectional nature of this relationship points to sleep quality as a crucial component in the management and prevention of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An et al.&#8216;s research supports these findings by demonstrating that disturbances in the circadian rhythm associated with insomnia can exacerbate depressive symptoms, emphasizing the role of biological clocks in managing both conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, this study found a strong link between educational attainment and the likelihood of depression among individuals with bone fractures. This echoes findings from previous research, suggesting that higher educational levels may be protective against depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Lorant et al. observed a dose-response relation for education and income, highlighting that higher educational levels not only equip individuals with better socio-economic stability but also significantly enhance their resilience against mental health challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our study has found the PIR to be a critical predictive factor for depression, emphasizing the strong link between economic status and mental health. This observation aligns with the findings of Knapp et al. The research highlights the importance of considering economic factors, such as cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, to better understand and address the vast economic impacts of mental ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Besides, white blood cell counts emerge as a significant predictive marker, resonating with Sealock et al.&#8216;s study. Their research indicates that the association between depression polygenic scores and white blood cell counts accounts for 9.8%, supporting a causal relationship between increased white blood cell counts and heightened risk of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, the findings of Nina et al. revealed that patients with severe depression exhibited a 43% higher white blood cell count in their cerebrospinal fluid compared to control subjects, further emphasizing the importance of monitoring white blood cell counts in addressing both psychological and physiological health challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">We developed a comprehensive nomogram model for predicting depression, achieving an AUC of 0.734 in the development cohort and 0.740 in the validation cohort through ROC analysis. This consistency underscores the model&#8217;s reliable predictive accuracy and overall stability across diverse patient groups. The calibration curves further affirmed the model&#8217;s credibility, illustrating its effective calibration in real-world scenarios. To enhance model simplicity and interpretability, we employed the LASSO regression, distilling the model down to five key variables. The simplified model demonstrated AUCs of 0.723 and 0.690 in the development and validation cohorts, respectively, without markedly compromising predictive accuracy. Our model&#8217;s reliance on objective variables&#8212;such as demographic details, lifestyle factors, laboratory examination, and physical health indicators&#8212;excludes subjective mental and emotional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This design choice targets the identification of individuals at elevated risk for depression who may not yet exhibit symptomatic evidence. In practical application, this model complements traditional depression assessments by filling a predictive niche, allowing for the identification of latent depression risks in patients who might score low or zero on conventional depression scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The nomogram simplifies complex regression equations into visual graphs, interpreting prediction model results more accessible. By assigning a score to each predictor and summing these scores, we can estimate the likelihood of a risk event for each patient. This instrument allows healthcare providers to quickly pinpoint patients at high risk and initiate appropriate interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, in our investigation, the nomogram&#8217;s cut-off value was determined to be 40. Individuals scoring 40 or above are classified as high-risk for developing depression among fracture patients. By integrating our nomogram with existing depression assessment tools, healthcare providers can achieve a more holistic view of a patient&#8217;s mental health landscape. This approach enables the anticipation of depressive episodes before they manifest, facilitating preemptive and more tailored therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Such a dual-pronged strategy enriches the clinician&#8217;s toolkit, ensuring that decisions are not solely based on current symptomatic presentations but are informed by a predictive understanding of depression risk. This nuanced methodology holds promise for enhancing patient care by allowing for early intervention strategies tailored to the individual&#8217;s specific risk profile, ultimately aiming to mitigate the onset of depression in at-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">In our study, participants with post-fracture conditions from the externally validated cohort showed a heightened risk of depression when compared to their peers in the NHANES database. This difference is probably due to disparities in the distribution of clinicopathological factors, including race, marital status, and treatment status, between patients in the external validation group and those recorded in the NHANES database. Despite these differences in key characteristics between the external validation and training groups, our model demonstrated reliability in the external validation cohort through the employment of advanced statistical techniques and comprehensive variable selection. This achievement underscores the potential applicability of our model in clinical practice, particularly in assessing and managing the risk of depression across diverse populations with varying backgrounds and characteristics.</p><p id="Par45">This study is subject to several limitations. Initially, there is a lack of detailed information on fracture sites, duration, severity, medication use, and psychiatric history, which are critical for a nuanced analysis. Additionally, the retrospective, cross-sectional nature of the data collection may introduce biases, necessitating cautious interpretation of our findings. Furthermore, numerous variables within the NHANES database have a substantial proportion of missing values, potentially skewing the study&#8217;s statistical outcomes. The focus solely on wrist, hip, and spine fractures may also limit the generalizability of our findings, as it does not encompass the full spectrum of trauma-related fractures. Lastly, the external validation was constrained by a limited sample size. To corroborate our results, comprehensive multicenter studies in real-world settings are imperative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec103"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">We formulated a predictive model that incorporates medical conditions, basic demographic data, lifestyle choices, physical ailments, and other measurable traits to forecast the risk of depression in fracture patients. This model demonstrated consistent and favorable discriminatory power across datasets spanning various time frames. Serving as an effective and precise evaluation tool, the nomogram facilitates the identification of individuals at risk for depression following a fracture, thereby aiding clinicians in refining their treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
