While some risk factors for CVDs are non-modifiable, other determinants like obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes and dyslipidemia can be mitigated by a wide plethora of measures to control CVD morbidity and mortality. Those determinants have been on the rise in Saudi Arabia, exacerbated by sedentary lifestyle. The Saudi Vision 2030 aims to reduce CVD clinical and economic burden and to scale up vitality and longevity; in a new era of comprehensive healthcare. From a health economics standpoint, CVDs entail a burden on healthcare systems directly through expenditure and indirectly through years living with the disease, low productivity, premature morbidity and mortality. This manuscript reviews current CV health and unmet needs in Saudi Arabia, discusses G20 countries&#8217; initiatives on primary prevention: public health measures, awareness programs; and proposes national registries and digital solutions to facilitate population-specific research, improve CV surveillance and alleviate CVD burden in Saudi Arabia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular risk factors</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Saudi Arabia</kwd><kwd>Saudi Vision 2030</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Sanofi</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>All activities related to the elaboration of this manuscript were funded by Sanofi.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In the last two decades, life expectancy in Saudi Arabia has increased from 69.08 years in 1990 to 75.13 years in 2019, as reported by The World Bank [<xref rid="b1-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, with the aging population comes the challenges of dealing with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [<xref rid="b2-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the definition of CVDs includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [<xref rid="b4-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Aside from the rise of CVDs in the aging population, it is also alarmingly spreading in the younger generation. In the United States of America, a study showed how unhealthy body weights among youth resulted in significantly increased CVD healthcare expenditure [<xref rid="b5-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cumulative healthcare expenditures (including CVDs-related costs) increase steadily with obesity, with an average of 8.6% increase in overweight, 18.8% in obese and 76% in morbidly obese people [<xref rid="b5-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings suggest that the lifetime risk for CVD increases in people who are overweight or obese in their youth. However, little efforts have been made into strategies to reduce CV risks at a younger age [<xref rid="b6-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There has been an interest lately in studying the widespread of non-communicable diseases, of which CVDs, in the younger generation and the multiple challenges a society is faced with to overcome them [<xref rid="b8-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to poor quality of life, earlier onset of CVDs is alarming in many ways: (1) the younger population constitutes the workforce; (2) chronic diseases, such as CVDs, have been associated with early retirement; and (3) long-term healthcare costs. Moreover, another factor that contributes to the rise of CVDs is urbanization, which has been strongly paired with increased smoking, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle and obesity [<xref rid="b9-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this current work is to compare the burden of CVDs in Saudi Arabia to that of other developed countries and focus on the CV risk factors and some proposed solutions. This will direct the focus afterwards in proposing a strategic direction to mitigate CV risks and alleviate the CVD burden, in terms of policies and practical measures, complying with the 2030 healthcare and economic vision for Saudi Arabia. The healthcare sector transformation program is set to prioritize public health and disease prevention, in addition to improving access to healthcare services through optimal coverage, comprehensive and equitable geographical distribution, as well as improving the quality of healthcare delivery and enhancing e-health services [<xref rid="b11-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>2. The economic impact of CVDs globally and in Saudi Arabia</title><p>Worldwide, developed countries are struggling with CVDs economic burden and government-based reimbursement schemes for in-patient and out-patient medical care [<xref rid="b10-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite some success in addressing CVDs globally, CVDs remain the leading cause of death in several developed countries [<xref rid="b12-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b15-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In France, over $23 billion (14% of total health insurance reimbursements) were directed towards CVDs and related chronic treatment, which is close to 0.9% of 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) [<xref rid="b16-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In China, 2016 data suggests CVD health expenditure of around $14 billion, which was around 0.1% of 2016 GDP [<xref rid="b17-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the United States, over $400 billion, which is around 2% of GDP, were spent on CVD expenditure in 2018, including direct healthcare costs and productivity loss [<xref rid="b18-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Australia, $3.7 billion (11% of healthcare expenditure) was dedicated to cover inpatient care for CVDs in 2012&#8211;2013, which is around 0.2% of 2013 GDP [<xref rid="b19-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Russia, CVD burden costs the economy over $30 billion in 2009, equivalent to 2.8% of the GDP [<xref rid="b20-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The economic burden of CVDs in Turkey was estimated to be $10.2 billion in 2016, making up 1.2% of 2016 GDP [<xref rid="b21-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These figures reflect the economic burden of CVDs globally and the lack of a current perfect model to deal with CVDs.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, health care burden collectively consumes over 8% (approximately $56 billion) of the government&#8217;s total budget [<xref rid="b22-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The economic burden of CVD in Saudi Arabia was estimated to be $3.5 billion ($1.9 billion in direct healthcare costs and $1.6 billion in indirect costs from loss of productivity) in 2016. It is estimated that this number will triple to $9.8 billion in 2035 [<xref rid="b23-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The need to promote healthful practices to limit the spread of vascular diseases, including CVDs, has been long identified. However, individual scattered efforts to control this epidemic did not meet the expectation and so far yielded rather modest outcomes [<xref rid="b2-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b25-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore government-backed strategies to improve healthcare in general and CVD prevention in particular are needed [<xref rid="b26-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Interventions should aim first at a primary prevention level focused on mitigating CV risk factors and preventing CVD onset, as well as secondary prevention level focused on diagnosing CVDs early on, through timely and comprehensive screening, to prevent complications.</p><p>Primary prevention is a cost-effective measure, whereby investing effort and resources into eliminating CV risk factors yields high returns. Screening and early diagnosis of CVDs should enforce strict management of modifiable risk factors (i.e. hyperlipidemia, smoking and diabetes mellitus) and therefore stabilizing the conditions and prevent disease complications and its economic and social consequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>3. CVD landscape in Saudi Arabia</title><sec><title>3.1. Prevalence of CVD in Saudi Arabia</title><p>In 2016, there were 201,300 Saudi nationals living with CVD, including 149,600 adults with ischemic heart disease and 51,700 with cerebrovascular disease. It is estimated that CVD accounts for over 45% of all deaths [<xref rid="b23-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b27-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In 2005, the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Saudi Arabia was estimated to be 5.5% [<xref rid="b27-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b29-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The current prevalence of CVD in Saudi Arabia is expected to be significantly higher, given the rise of CVD risk factors in the country (obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension and others) [<xref rid="b30-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, the 2012 extrapolated prevalence of heart failure in Saudi Arabia was estimated at around 1.2% (for a total population of around 29 million) and a 2013 study showed that 20% of patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome suffered from heart failure [<xref rid="b31-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b33-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Determinants of CVDs in Saudi Arabia</title><p>Lately, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s lifestyle has become permissive to the onset of non-communicable diseases of the developed world. Despite socioeconomic disparities within Saudi Arabia, newer generations have generally adopted a sedentary lifestyle [<xref rid="b35-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is likely multifactorial, due to the weather environment limiting outdoor activities and walking or biking to work, along with the influence of globalization ranging from social media and video-games use to cosmopolitan fat- and sugar-rich diet. The increasingly sedentary lifestyle of Saudis negatively impacted their well-being. In particular, rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia almost doubled since the start of the new millennium [<xref rid="b2-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The Global Obesity Observatory showed an increase in the prevalence of obesity from 26.4% amongst men and 44% amongst women in the year 2000, to 31.5% amongst men and 50.4% amongst women in the year 2005. Although obesity rates were lower in 2019 with 19.2% amongst men and 21.4% amongst women, the rates of overweight are strikingly high, comprising 38.2% amongst the sampled population and making more than half of the population either obese or overweight [<xref rid="b37-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A more recent 2020 nationwide cross-sectional survey, reported obesity prevalence in Saudi Arabia at 24.7%, with consistently higher rates of several obesity-associated morbidities [<xref rid="b38-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As reported in a systematic review in 2016, Saudi women in particular are more susceptible to CVDs due partly to the low level of physical activity ranging between 53% and 98% that likely led to higher prevalence of CVD risks: hypertension (22%), diabetes (ranging between 10% and 28%), overweight (27%) and obesity (40%) [<xref rid="b39-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The higher rates of obesity amongst women was also further underscored by the above-mentioned reports from the Global Obesity Observatory [<xref rid="b37-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Regardless of trends, overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia, and they are mostly attributed to sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet [<xref rid="b40-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The prevalence of tobacco use went from 12.2% in 2013 to 21.4% in 2018 and 20% in 2019 [<xref rid="b42-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b45-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, globalization, urbanization, the rise of an aging population, as well as socioeconomic changes and stress, can all contribute to the rise of CVDs [<xref rid="b4-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Data collected between April 2019 and February 2021 on the government&#8217;s e-service portal (ABSHER) were analyzed for prevalence of major chronic disease risk factors. <xref rid="f1-sha148-162" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> reports data on the prevalence of the major CV risk enhancers in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2017 study and to data extracted from the ABSHER platform in 2021 [<xref rid="b30-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b46-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Discrepancies might be due to changes occurring between 2017 and 2020, the much larger sample of the 2020 and potential under-estimations due to the nature of self-reported data [<xref rid="b47-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3.3. Addressing the modifiable risk factors</title><p>Lifestyle modifications, which include healthy diets, regular exercise and avoiding smoking remain an essential part of healthy living. Weight control and weight loss can be achieved through two main domains: the promotion of physical activity, and adopting healthy diet habits.</p><p>Several lifestyle and diet habits interventions have been studied previously. A trial carried out in a primary healthcare center in Northern Sweden included 151 subjects at risk for CVDs, randomized them to intervention and control arms. The intervention consisted of exercise (supervised endurance and circuit training in groups three times a week for three months) and diet (five group sessions of diet counselling with a dietitian). One year later, waist circumference (&#8722;1.9 cm, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), waist-to-hip ratio (&#8722;0.01, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (&#8722;2.3 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) have all significantly decreased [<xref rid="b48-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another study evaluated the efficacy of lifestyle intervention (counselling on smoking, exercise, nutrition, and stress) on CV risk mitigation in middle-aged people by randomizing them to either counseling intervention group or standard of care group. Compared to the control (standard of care) arm, the intervention group had significantly lower total cholesterol levels (&#8722;0.41 mmol/L, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and lower systolic blood pressure (&#8722;7.49 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the secondary prevention group, no major outcome changes were recorded, highlighting the effectiveness of primary prevention in mitigating CV risk [<xref rid="b49-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Healthy behavior and CV risks were described in women with at least one CV risk factor, subjected either to lifestyle intervention or to standard of care (control). A significantly higher proportion of women improved their eating habits in the intervention group (58.4%) compared to the standard of care (control) (33.1%) as well as physical activity improvement (57.3% versus 42.3%, respectively, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Blood pressure significantly decreased by 9.1% from baseline in the intervention group (systolic &#8722;5.9 mmHg and diastolic &#8722;3.8 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), HDL-cholesterol went up by 2.6 mg/dl (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), along with an improvement in other CV risk factors, contributing to an overall decrease in the 10-year CV risk by 0.9% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) [<xref rid="b50-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Studies carried out in the last decade have shown that LDL-cholesterol targets are only achieved in around 30% of patients [<xref rid="b51-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A large proportion of patients with dyslipidemia are left unidentified and untreated in Saudi Arabia; underscoring gaps in screening, treatment and compliance with international guidelines [<xref rid="b51-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In 2022, the World Heart Federation reiterated the importance of lipid management for the success of CV risk management, requiring diverse approaches from access to screening and lipid-lowering medications (statins and combinations as needed), to risk stratification, health literacy and health policy changes [<xref rid="b52-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In 2022, the Saudi Guidelines for Dyslipidemia Management were published, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework for controlling dyslipidemia in the country and its cardiovascular consequences [<xref rid="b53-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The JuvenTUM project in Germany assessed the outcomes of a physical education program on school children and found that health-related lessons at school and an increased in physical activity resulted in decreased waist circumference by 1.7 cm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), more pronounced among children with obesity (&#8722;3.2 cm, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref rid="b54-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In Tunisia, a school-based program to promote healthy lifestyles included educational sessions on tobacco use, physical activity and healthy nutrition. Students were evaluated before and after the intervention. Knowledge, behaviors, and intentions in the intervention group improved. In terms of smoking, at baseline, 11.5% of students knew that smoking causes CVDs <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> 46.3% after the intervention, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; and while only 49.1% of students were aware of the lung cancer risk, the proportion increased to 84.9% after the intervention (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001).

This will require a multidisciplinary approach including geneticists, endocrinologists, and adult and pediatric cardiologists. The Saudi government looks at CVD as a public health priority. Therefore, in 2022 the government allocated a one-time payment of $3000 per patient over five years for screening tests, healthcare costs and lipid-lowering therapies; with the aim to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. It is estimated to screen most of the Saudi population for CV risk factors within a five-year timeframe [<xref rid="b73-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].

The quality of care should also be enforced by the MOH to make sure the CV risk factors are well-managed.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2.4. Manpower shortage</title><p>Although in some hospitals the advanced medical diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have been available, the issues with resources allocation and the shortage of qualified medical personnel have made their use limited. This highlights the need to assess the shortage nationally and focus on addressing the educational needs within the country and focused abroad scholarship programs in deficient areas to invest in the local manpower. All the deficient degrees (i.e. nurse practitioners) should have a formal classification under the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) to facilitate their transition to work after their training. In 2021, Saudi Arabia had a population of 34, 110, 821 [<xref rid="b87-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].

The number of men&#8217;s fitness centers in Saudi Arabia has increased from 485,000 in 2012 to 890,000 in 2017. While women-only fitness centers have become more available and popular since they were licensed in 2017. Earlier data suggest over 90% of Saudi women report being physically inactive, partly due to the absence of adapted facilities in their neighborhood [<xref rid="b97-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. According to a nationwide survey, membership fees to fitness clubs in Saudi Arabia range between $240 and $1000 per month, and reports indicate that 40% of Saudi women are reluctant to join a fitness center due to costs [<xref rid="b97-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Organized fitness centers are located in major cities such as: Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Al-Khobar, Makkah and Medina; while other cities have limited fitness centers. The promotion of physical activity in Saudi Arabia warrants health promotion initiatives by all concerned stakeholders, to lessen the discrepancy in physical activity between genders and provide widely accessible and affordable community fitness centers [<xref rid="b98-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="b99-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4.3.

Population education can be achieved through mass media (television, social media platforms, etc.) and through targeted patient education at medical centers, schools and focused communities.</p><p>In particular, people at high risk of CVD or with established CVD must be encouraged to seek medical care, starting at the primary care level. Communities should trust their primary care physicians and should be made aware of the efficiency of <bold><italic toggle="yes">primary prevention</italic></bold> of CVDs and early diagnosis of CVDs, to ensure timely management takes place.

A recent systematic review showed that behavioral counselling on diet and physical activity measures have been shown to modestly reduce BP over a period of 6&#8211;18 months. However, counselling effects are more pronounced when it comes to lowering LDL level, reducing it by a mean of 2.2 mg/dl [<xref rid="b101-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The effects of social media and advertisements have been another challenge in promoting unhealthy diet.

Leveraging CV healthcare</title><p>A multidisciplinary approach can be implemented in primary care clinics throughout the Saudi Arabian territories. Primary healthcare clinics could be expanded to include a CVD prevention program; and step up CV health prevention across all Saudi Arabia provinces. The government has indeed recognized the need for healthcare restructuring and the importance of leveraging care in primary care centers, which are at the forefront of prevention and timely diagnosis of CV risk factors [<xref rid="b26-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These prevention programs can be implemented virtually, for selected follow-up appointments. This could help solve the issue of understaffed medical facilities that hinder PCPs from fulfilling their role in CV prevention [<xref rid="b103-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>4.5. Stakeholders in CV health</title><p>The goal of containing CV risk factors and promoting healthful practices requires a collaboration of governmental institutions, municipalities, schools and colleges, food manufactures and restaurants, as well as the community and individuals. The MOH operates over half of medical facilities across the country, and other governmental hospitals directed by the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of National Guard, the Ministry of Interior, and King Faisal Specialist hospitals. These governmental institutions could liaise with other organizations such as sports medicine association, sports for all federation, Saudi Heart Association, Saudi Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Saudi Society for Food and Nutrition and others to design and implement programs to combat sedentary lifestyle and promote CV health [<xref rid="b98-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The Saudi Health Council has streamlined a seamless connection between different healthcare providers to ensure that quality, ease of access as well as prevention and early detection metrics are met. The promotion of physical activity will have a greater impact on society when joint efforts are made amongst the previously mentioned ministries [<xref rid="b98-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Awareness must be spread at every level and policies must be set out to govern practices, promote use of resources and enforce quality measures. In 2017, at a roundtable in Riyadh, the Saudi Heart Association, together with the World Heart Federation and the Saudi Health Council, laid down roadblocks to improve CVD management at the patient, clinician and healthcare system levels in light of the 2017 cholesterol roadmap.

Currently, data are manually entered into the registry by physicians, but plans for the automated extraction of data from electronic health records are underway. A recent study analyzed the effectiveness of statins in preventing major CV events after coronary artery bypass grafting, in patients entered into the SWEDEHEART registry and other nationwide databases. The large sample size (&gt;35,000) increases the precision and the reliability of study results. Statins were found to decrease the incidence of CV events by 44%, all-cause death by 47%, CV death by 46%, myocardial infarction by 39%, and stroke by 34%; reemphasizing the role of statins in secondary prevention of CVDs in patients who have undergone revascularization [<xref rid="b104-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Another important finding from the SWEDEHEART cohort is the higher risk of recurrent CV events after myocardial infarction among patients with family history of early-onset CVDs; which means that higher-risk patients would be more closely monitored to prevent recurrent events [<xref rid="b104-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].

The <bold><italic toggle="yes">CUORE project</italic></bold>, developed by the Italian Ministry of Health and coordinated by the National Institute of Health, gives general practitioners a platform to enter data and estimate risk scores for their patients. A recommended plan is then drafted for patients in terms of lifestyle modifications. The data is also collected for epidemiological research and to provide trends for individual patients. A 10-year CV risk assessment from CUORE data showed that 31% of the 140,000-strong sample had at least two risk assessments, of which 11% shifted to lower risk categories after a year with 0.6 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure, a 0.5 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure, and 4.1 mg/dl drop in total cholesterol and a 3% reduction in the number of smokers [<xref rid="b106-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].

Moreover, despite reports of increased levels of LDL-cholesterol, body mass index and diabetes rates, age-adjusted death rates from heart disease in Japan declined by 61% between 1980 and 2012. This is partially due to an 8.4 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (associated with a 24.4% lower death rate), a decrease smoking prevalence (believed to have contributed to 11.1% of death rate fall) and an increased physical activity (explaining 7.5% of all delayed or prevented deaths) [<xref rid="b111-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>].

KardioPro participation was associated with significantly increased physician costs (by 33%), reduced hospital costs (by 19%), and reduced pharmaceutical costs (by 16%) [<xref rid="b115-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>].</p><p>In the UK, the Quality and Outcomes Framework, established in 2004, rewards PCPs for the proper management of the most common chronic diseases, including CVDs through the pay-for-performance scheme. While the financial incentives have proven effective in increased screening, the overall benefits of this scheme remained limited [<xref rid="b116-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. However, a similar approach, with financial (and non-financial) incentives, holds the potential to motivate PCPs to rigorously identify CV risk factors and manage them more aggressively.</p><p>Between 1988 and 1993, close to 6000 people with at least one CV risk factor were enrolled in the Physical Activity on Prescription program initiated in the city of Sollentuna in Sweden. Two decades later, this population presented with lower risk of CV events (12%), CV deaths (21%) and all-cause deaths (17%), compared to the population of Stockholm [<xref rid="b117-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. This underscores the importance of health interventions at the primary care level and how early intervention results in long-term protection against CVDs. In 2001, Weinehall et al. reported on the first 10 years of the Norsj&#246; community intervention program in Northern Sweden, which aimed at providing grounds for CVD prevention. Health screening and counselling resulted in major impact on dietary habits and were well received by the community; highlighting the possibility of creating local/regional programs that cater to the specific needs of a community in terms of CV health. The V&#228;sterbotten Intervention Program was designed and evaluated in Norsj&#246; and then extended to other Swedish regions. The 10-year evaluation of the program showed significantly greater reductions in cholesterol and blood pressure levels in Norsj&#246;, resulting in 36% reduction in CV mortality, compared to another Northern Sweden city (with 1% reduction in CV mortality) [<xref rid="b118-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Importantly, such programs aim to increase the rate of health checks and to decrease the gap between socio-economically privileged and underprivileged communities. This program also allowed the creation of a massive population-based database and, once again, reemphasized the role of primary care centers in CVD prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>5.2. The establishment of a CVD registry in Saudi Arabia</title><p>The current practice in Saudi Arabia is governed by the latest US and European guidelines. These data might not always be applicable to our population in Saudi Arabia. In order to improve the CV healthcare outcomes in Saudi Arabia, one needs to understand the population better by collecting our own data and launching a continuous CV health registry. The registry should have multiple tracks focusing on risks, prevention, diagnoses, management and outcomes of CVDs. This initiative will also serve in identifying unmet needs, improving public health outcomes and will lead to more specific Saudi-based guidelines. Such data will also serve as grounds for updating national guidelines on CV prevention and management. The success of such an initiative will heavily depend on government&#8217;s support; in terms of mandatory data entry, data verification, data collection and analysis along with the necessary funding. Setting up registries will require financing for platform design, expert consultation, information technology support for the creation and maintenance of the database, as well as data management and analysis. The ABSHER platform launched in 2015 by the Saudi Health Council ensures a secure mass collection of health-related data, in an attempt to extract insights and advance decision-making [<xref rid="b46-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Such self-reported platform can help in large scale epidemiological studies along with the help of the National Heart Centre, which could oversee the questionnaire design, data collection and analysis in the field of CV medicine. Recently, the Tawakkalna and the Sehhaty platforms have been launched in response to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The Tawakkalna application was used to issue movement permits during curfew, to report violations of rules to curb the spread of the virus, and to inform on users&#8217; health status and now being widely used to ensure vaccinations compliance [<xref rid="b119-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The Sehhaty application makes health information and medical e-services, provided by different health organizations in Saudi Arabia, accessible to users. These services include vital signs updates, tracking prescribed medications, retrieving and sharing sick leaves, booking appointments for COVID-19 vaccination, promoting a healthy lifestyle, etc. [<xref rid="b120-sha148-162" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] These platforms and others could be channeled towards healthcare services beyond COVID-19, once the pandemic has completely subsided.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>6.

Concluding statements</title><p>In conclusion, Saudi Arabia, like other industrialized countries, is dealing with a great CVDs burden attributed to aging population and the rise of CV risk factors. This pattern is exacerbated by increasing rates of obesity and unhealthy lifestyle. However, with the current trajectory of the health reform in Saudi, a collaborative approach is needed to address CV risk factors and reduce the burden of CVD in the country. Focus should be shifted now to prevention on multiple levels, including individual educational and awareness programs, community programs as well as well-established primary care clinics that are widely accessible and offer high quality screening and management programs. These programs will create a cost-effective approach and will lower the morbidity and mortality associated with CVDs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement and Funding</title><p>Medical writing and editorial assistance was provided by Jessica Saliba, PhD from KBP-Biomak, a Contract Research Organization.
