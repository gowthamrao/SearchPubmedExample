All participants were adults, and the night before the baseline interview, they had slept on the street, at a shelter or any facility provided to care for people living homeless. The information was collected using structured interviews, repeated twice a year for a 3&#8208;year follow&#8208;up period. The findings of this study show that women experiencing homelessness presented poor health, particularly in comparison with the general Spanish population. Over half of the women questioned claimed to have a diagnosed serious or chronic illness, with a correlation between these conditions and the age, time spent homeless or high levels of drug use. There was a positive correlation found between women's perceived health status and being younger and having access to independent accommodation, while having suffered a number of stressful life events and having spent long periods of time living homeless presented a negative correlation with a good perceived health status.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="phn13130-kwd-0001">gender perspective</kwd><kwd id="phn13130-kwd-0002">health</kwd><kwd id="phn13130-kwd-0003">homelessness</kwd><kwd id="phn13130-kwd-0004">perceived health</kwd><kwd id="phn13130-kwd-0005">women</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6566"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January/February 2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.2.7 mode:remove_FC converted:11.04.2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

</p></notes></front><body><sec id="phn13130-sec-0010"><label>1</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People experiencing homelessness reflect one of the most extreme example of the worldwide phenomenon of poverty and social exclusion (Guill&#233;n et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Suarez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; V&#225;zquez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and, of those people, women are particularly vulnerable in a number of ways (V&#225;zquez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>), with their own set of circumstances and backgrounds, usually differing from those of their male counterparts (Aldridge et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Unfortunately, women tend to be under&#8208;represented in research on homelessness, and the gender issues of this group are under&#8208;researched (Bretherton, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rodr&#237;guez&#8208;Moreno et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), despite gender analysis being a key focal point in the field of public health, in order to understand social inequities and inequalities in health (Hankivsky et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). According to Winetrobe et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), the consideration of the excluded population as a homogeneous group limits the development of appropriate health and social security policies.</p><p>A number of authors (e.g., Hatch &amp; Dohrenwend, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; V&#225;zquez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) have pointed out that economic factors are not the only one impacting the situation of people experiencing homelessness. In this regard, health problems seem to play a relevant role in the sliding into homelessness and remaining in this situation (Caton et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Greenberg &amp; Rosenheck, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), as well as in the processes of become homeless again having had access to independent accommodation (Aubry et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Roca et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In terms of the health of people experiencing homelessness, a range of studies point towards the existence of high mortality rates among the homeless population (Hwang et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), some suggesting a higher risk among women (Nordentoft &amp; Wandall&#8208;Holm, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Nusselder et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, remaining homeless poses a major threat to health (Aubry et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ropers &amp; Boyer, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) as it aggravates existing conditions, delays recovery and can cause new illnesses (Schanzer et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Also, serious illnesses seem to be connected with long&#8208;term homelessness, meaning that people with serious and/or chronic health conditions will remain in that situation for longer periods (Parker, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). People who spend long periods living homeless and also suffer from health issues are at a greater risk of suffering particularly negative health consequences for other reasons, such as the prevalence of substance abuse and limited access to preventive healthcare (Parker, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies show that people experiencing homelessness tend to be in a poor state of health, which are particularly serious in the case of women. Women experiencing homelessness tend to present more chronic physical health conditions than their male counterparts (Gawron et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Montgomery et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vuillermoz et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In the US, for example, Winetrobe et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) reported that more women living homeless suffered with diagnosed chronic physical health conditions than men and Montgomery et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) found that a larger proportion of women suffered from chronic medical conditions than men. In Sweden, Beijer and Andr&#233;asson (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) found that people living homeless had twice the risk of being hospitalized than the general population, with the younger homeless women being most likely to be taken into hospital, principally for skin infections linked to increased exposure to excessive consumption of psychoactive substances and poor hygiene. In France, Vuillermoz et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) stated that 25% of the women living homeless interviewed had suffered at least one untreated healthcare requirement in the year prior to the interview. Along the same lines, in a country with a low level of income such as Nicaragua, V&#225;zquez et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) observed that the poor health condition of homeless people was particularly negative among women.</p><p>In Spain, Mu&#241;oz et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) noted that the perception of health among people experiencing homelessness (52.9% good vs. 30.7% poor) was worse than among people at risk &#8208; who used public services but still had their homes &#8211; (69.8% good vs. 20.0% poor) and general population (68.8% good vs. 15.2% poor). The Spanish Institute of National Statistics (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), found that 70.4% of Spanish women perceived their health status to be good, 21.0% said it was fair and 8.5% said it was poor. INE (2018) also indicated that 68.2% of Spanish women suffered from a chronic or long&#8208;term illness or health condition. The main issues of this nature that had been medically diagnoses in Spanish women over 15 were chronic back pain (lumbar) (23.5%), chronic back pain (cervical) (21.5%), high blood pressure (20.0%), high cholesterol (17.8%), migraines or frequent headaches (13.6%) or diabetes (7.1%),</p><p>In Spain, the situation of women experiencing homelessness is understudied, and no longitudinal studies of this kind have been conducted. However, it is important to obtain data focusing on specific environments, as the extrapolation of findings to different setting can be problematic. Among other issues, this is because of differences across countries in terms of systems and access to healthcare, the scope of social protection networks, climate, the concentration of extreme poverty in urban areas or the makeup of socially excluded groups. The purpose of this work is to contribute to the study of health among women experiencing homelessness in Madrid, and how their health evolves over time. The results obtained will provide information to be taken into consideration for the design and roll&#8208;out of healthcare policies, health services and gender&#8208;based care schemes for the homeless.</p></sec><sec id="phn13130-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>METHOD</title><p>The study was carried out based on data collected from a sample of women experiencing homelessness (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;138), interviewed in Madrid, Spain.

The information (both at baseline and follow&#8208;up) was collected using structured interview, which solved any potential issues with reading and/or comprehension. The structured interview used was a version with a gender perspective of an instrument used in previous studies for people experiencing homelessness in Madrid, which was adapted to the fact that the interviewees were women. The first structured interview collected information on 1227 variables and lasted between 45 and 80 min. The follow&#8208;up interviews were shorter &#8211; lasting around 30&#8211;60 min, and focused on the issues most likely to have changed over the period. The interviews were conducted by four interviewers with experience in researches of similar characteristics. Data were recorded and coded by the interviewers. The purpose of the study was explained to the women they were asked to provide informed consent and personal data before completing the interview, as well as permission for researchers to contact them by mobile phone, social media or third parties.</p><p>During the follow&#8208;up period, participants were contacted regularly, with the support of institutions and organizations working with people experiencing homelessness and with the collaboration of friends of the interviewees, neighbors, service users and social workers. Personal contact with the participants was maintained on a regular basis in the street and in the care facilities and, when possible, the participants were contacted by mobile phone, WhatsApp or social media. Conducting follow&#8208;up interviews sometimes required travel to different parts of Spain. Some interviews with participants who had returned to their country of origin were conducted by telephone or via internet (Skype, WhatsApp&#8230;). The interviewees did not receive any incentive for their participation in the initial interview or in the first two follow&#8208;up interviews (6 and 12 months after the initial interview). The follow&#8208;up interviews conducted 18, 24, and 36&#160;months after the baseline interview were incentivized with a voucher (worth 20 euros) exchangeable for products in supermarkets.</p><p>Ethical approval was granted by the appropriate Institutional Review Board. All initial information was collected over the course of a calendar year, and the follow&#8208;up interviews were conducted at intervals of 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36&#160;months after that. Of the 138 women originally interviewed, it was possible to interview 92 women after 6&#160;months, 85 women after 12 months, 82 women after 18 months, 73 women after 24 months, and 67 women after 36&#160;months. At 36&#160;months follow&#8208;up period, 33.8% of the women could not be located and 8.8% declined to be interviewed. In addition, we verified that three women returned to their country of origin and eight died. Throughout the 3&#8208;years follow&#8208;up period, the mean age of the interviewees, the mean time living homeless, and the mean age at which they first found themselves living homeless remained relatively constant. Also, the respondents&#8217; educational background and their perceived health status remained relatively constant during follow&#8208;up period. However, after 3&#8208;years follow&#8208;up period a decrease in the percentage of women with foreign nationality was observed, but we consider that this variation does not have a significant impact on the results obtained in the study.</p><p>The database was created, and data processed using the SPSS statistical analysis and data management system 21.0.

This is well below the 70% of women in the Spanish population in general (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this regard, the percentage of women interviewed (with an average age of 45) who considered their health to be good was lower than the percentage of Spanish women aged between 65 and 74 who perceived their state of the health to be good (48.5%) (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Fazel et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) observed that people experiencing homelessness tend to acquire very early&#8208;onset age&#8208;related functional deficiencies. Ruiz&#8208;Coronel et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) state that the lifestyle resulting from adaptation to life on the street and the relationships that homeless people forge with their social and material environment immerses them in a rapid process of physical and psychological decline, suggesting the living homeless seems to make people grow old faster (Fazel et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ruiz&#8208;Coronel et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In this regard, different authors point out that people experiencing homelessness should have access at age around 50 to the services designed for the general population aged over 65(Brown et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; McDonald et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>The poor perception of health condition among women experiencing homelessness is particularly evident in the fact that 26.5% of interviews claimed to be in a poor state of health, compared to the 8.5% of Spanish women overall (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). While there seems to be a tendency among people experiencing homelessness to positively overestimate their health condition (Ruiz&#8208;Coronel et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), this perception is negative in the case of women in this situation. Also, as observed by Vuillermoz et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) in women experiencing homelessness in Paris, a poor perception of health was associated to unmet healthcare needs. It is worth noting that over 3&#160;years of follow&#8208;up, the participants&#8217; perceived health situation was consistent with that reported at baseline, meaning their perception of their own health condition was consistent over time.</p><p>The younger participants and, in particular, those who accessed independent accommodation during the 3&#8208;year follow&#8208;up period, tended to have a better perceived state of health. Access to independent housing, and its consequent lifestyle implications, appears as one of the most relevant variables for a positive perception of health condition. So, for people experiencing homelessness with significant health issues it would be appropriate to include them on care schemes that include housing with support (Nelson et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Providing access to housing, together with intensive health, social and community care, has proven to be effective in overcoming the homeless situation (Tsemberis et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile a negative correlation can be seen between perceiving oneself to be in good health and suffering from a high number of stressful life events, having been the victim of intimate partner violence and remaining homeless for long periods, together with presenting feeling of loneliness or abandonment. These data largely coincide with those obtained by Bullard and Sittner (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and Rivas et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), who found that suffering sexual violence in childhood and intimate partner violence in adulthood were predictors of worsening physical health in women experiencing homelessness. Along the same lines, Vuillermoz et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) found that the perception of poor health correlated with victimization and depression. In the opinion of Montgomery et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and Gawron et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), women presented a greater decline in health than men due to their increased risk of suffering violent situations. Multiple and/or severe stressful life events from an early age is linked to spending long periods of time homeless (V&#225;zquez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>). A number of authors have noted that remaining in a homeless situation poses a major threat to health, as it aggravates existing conditions, compromises recovery from those issues and can lead to new illnesses (Aubry, et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Guill&#233;n et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Mu&#241;oz et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ropers &amp; Boyer, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Schanzer et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). People with severe and/or chronic illness tend to remain homeless for longer (Parker, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Additionally, people who have been homeless for long period of time and suffer from health issues run a far greater risk of suffering worsening health crises, due to issues such as an increase in substance use and more barriers to accessing medical services (Parker, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Around one quarter of the women interviewed in Madrid considered that their state of health had declined over the previous year, while just under half felt that their health had improved over the same period. These percentages are similar at baseline and after the 3&#8208;year follow&#8208;up period, suggesting a significant consistency over time. The relatively positive subjective perception of self&#8208;health of improved health contrasts notably with the fact that around half of those interviewed reported suffering from a medically diagnosed severe or chronic condition. This matter particularly affected women who had been experiencing homelessness for the longest. Although in principle the percentage of women suffering from a serious or chronic medical condition seems high, it is actually considerably lower than the proportion of women in the general Spanish population (68%) with a long&#8208;term or chronic illness or health condition (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). It should be assessed whether there could be under&#8208;diagnosis of certain conditions among women experiencing homelessness, which would be associated with the difficulties in accessing adequate healthcare (V&#225;zquez et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>), particularly in the case of primary care.</p><p>Around two thirds of those interviewed reported have suffered physical pain or discomfort during the month immediately preceding the interview, a third of whom referred cases of severe or extreme pain. These data, similar at baseline and after 3&#160;years of follow&#8208;up, could be interpreted as indicative of negative health among women experiencing homelessness. The most common conditions and ailments among those interviewed were chronic back pain, headaches, accident&#8208;related injuries, asthma, bronchitis and hypertension. Similar prevalence of some of these (e.g., hypertension, asthma) was observed by Gawron et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) among women experiencing homelessness in the US. Some of the most common ailments or illnesses among the interviewees also match the chronic or long&#8208;term conditions most common in the general women's population in Spain (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), with a similar prevalence of chronic back pain or hypertension among women living homeless and those who were not (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, health problems such as headaches, accident&#8208;related injuries, chronic bronchitis or asthma were more widespread in women experiencing homelessness than in the general Spanish population (INE, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Prolonged periods living homeless and facing multiple and/or severe stressful life events (including the use of psychoactive substances) would help to explain the greater trend of these health problems among women experiencing homelessness. So, it can be seen that women who suffered injuries from an accident, or asthma, tended to have been on the streets for longer, and those who suffered from migraines, asthma o accident injuries, for the most part had been drug users. As reported by Ruiz&#8208;Coronel et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) the homeless lifestyle seems to immerse these women into a rapid process of physical decline.</p><p>Women experiencing homelessness were also affected by others severe and chronic conditions, such rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, epilepsy, cancer&#8230; Special attention requires the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS amount women experiencing homelessness in Madrid, as it a chronic and very severe illness, still highly stigmatized. The percentage of women experiencing homelessness in Madrid with HIV/AIDS (15%) was fifty times higher than in the general Spanish population (0.3%) and three hundred times higher than among women in the general population (0.05%) (Unidad de Vigilancia de VIH y Comportamientos de Riesgo, <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Furthermore, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS found among those interviewed in Madrid was much higher than that observed among women experiencing homelessness in the US, found different researchers to be between 1% and 3% (Gawron et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Montgomery et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The fact that the Spanish public health sector largely offers appropriate HIV treatment for women experiencing homelessness may have had an influence on the condition no longer being a necessarily fatal condition (Deeks et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which can help explain, in part, the high number of women experiencing homelessness in Madrid with HIV. It is noteworthy that the women interviewed in Madrid suffering from HIV/AIDS had been homeless for twice as long, and an even greater number had abused drugs. This high proportion of women experiencing homelessness with HIV could be due to the fact that the participants had a high risk of exposure to the virus (i.e., intravenous drug use, sexual assaults from an early age, intimate partner violence and other gender&#8208;related violence, difficulties in taking precautions during sex&#8230;). In this regard, it is essential to pay particular attention and provide support to the women experiencing homelessness most exposed to these situations.</p><p>This study presents limitations, of which it is particularly notable that the information was obtained using a structured interview, without the possibility of contrasting it with other sources of information that the participants may provide. In addition, the study took place in Madrid (Spain), where the healthcare and social care system is not easily comparable with other contexts, making it difficult to generalize the results obtained. There is also a lack of previous studies on the issues dealt with in this paper, both in Madrid and in other regions or countries, and this has made it significantly difficult to compare the results with other research, thus narrowing down the understanding of the issue in question.</p><p>Madrid has sufficient health services to be able to address all the medical needs of the people experiencing homelessness correctly. However, it is essential to remove the barriers that are making it difficult for people experiencing homelessness to access the medical service: for example, ignorance of location and access procedures, insufficient knowledge of health issues, lack of social skills, mental health problems, substance use&#8230; In order to do this, it would be necessary to roll out street outreach teams and gender&#8208;sensitive homeless support that prioritizes access to primary care. Healthcare services should be aware of the environmental conditions in which homeless people live, and adapt their management of chronic conditions accordingly (Fazel et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hwang et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>As found by Fazel et&#160;al. (<xref rid="phn13130-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), a relevant political initiative would be to set targets relating to the health of people experiencing homelessness for national and regional healthcare plans, including differential gender&#8208;specific considerations. People experiencing homelessness with health problems should be provided with coverage of their basic needs (i.e., accommodation, medication, appropriate food, etc.) from a gender perspective, thus facilitating proper treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. Health care and services for homeless men and women should also bear in mind the effect of different functional limitations identified, and anticipate their onset at earlier ages than are normally identified in the general population (Fazel et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Health professionals should be able to detect cognitive impairment, mobility issues, urinary incontinence or falls in homeless adults aged 50 and over (Brown et&#160;al., <xref rid="phn13130-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Finally, an improvement in the health of the socially vulnerable would impact the prevention of the slide into homelessness, making it easier to overcome this situation and, overall, it would mean an improvement in the quality of life for those experiencing homelessness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="phn13130-sec-0060"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>No potential competing interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="phn13130-sec-0050"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The research has received institutional review board (IRB) approval by Comit&#233; de &#201;tica de la Investigaci&#243;n y de Experimentaci&#243;n Animal (Research Ethics and Animal Experimentation Committee) of the University of Alcal&#225; (C&#243;d.
