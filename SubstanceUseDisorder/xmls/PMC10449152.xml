In the United States, the opioid epidemic is a national public health emergency, with recent estimates suggesting that more than 10 million Americans aged 12 or older misused opioids in 2020 [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prescription opioids are a major contributor to misuse, which can lead to addiction and death. Drug overdose deaths involving prescription opioids rose from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,416 in 2020 [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of surgical pain is the second most common reason patients receive opioids, and thus is an important avenue of exposure to opioid-related risks [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Postoperative pain management attempts to balance opioid-facilitated analgesia against the inherent risks of opioids. Inadequate pain management besides causing human suffering, increases risk of complications including the development of chronic pain [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the receipt of prescription opioids after surgery is associated with increased risks of long-term opioid use disorders [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overprescribing can also lead to opioid diversion with the excess opioids [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis suggests that surgical procedures are associated with nearly 7% of patients experiencing persistent opioid use after surgery [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding how to provide adequate pain management and mitigate the risk of developing opioid use disorders remains a top question in the surgical field.</p><p>The Medicaid population presents unique challenges in perioperative pain management because multiple stressors can complicate their pain outcomes [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, opioid use disorder (well known to adversely impact pain outcomes) is higher among Medicaid beneficiaries [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among the two million nonelderly US adults with opioid use disorder, nearly 40% were covered by Medicaid [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Increased socioeconomic stressors and pre-existing opioid exposures makes perioperative pain management and use of opioids more fraught in the Medicaid population.</p><p>The prevalence of opioid-related adverse outcomes (OAO) in the Medicaid population is not well-documented. Predicting risks within the covered population can help state Medicaid programs implement interventions targeting individuals at high-risk for adverse opioid-related outcomes and to promote precision medicine. The aim of this paper is to develop a risk score for Medicaid patients who are at high risk for opioid abuse, dependence and overdose following surgery. This score can be used to identify patients at risk who might benefit from alternative pain management modalities or need additional monitoring and support. In addition, understanding the risk of OAO in vulnerable populations (i.e., patients with depression, or previous substance abuse can inform prescribing practices by clinicians to these higher-risk patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>We received the HIPAA patient waiver allowing us to access and use the patient&#8217;s medical records for research purposes.

We categorized surgeries using the Clinical Classifications Software for Services and Procedures (CCS-Services and Procedures). (<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). We included the most common major surgeries but excluded those that would likely have a low pain profile such as cataracts, breast biopsies, etc. We excluded individuals who underwent more than one surgery to ensure that any opioid event (e.g., prescription, opioid disorder diagnosis) is not related to another surgery. We included enrollees with continuous Medicaid coverage for at least 6 months prior and 12 months after the surgery event. This ensured data observability and a complete capture of persons&#8217; characteristics and outcomes needed for prediction. We excluded enrollees who were 65 years of age and older due to their dual eligibility for Medicare, for which we had no claim data. The starting age of inclusion was 15 years, because prescription and illicit opioid use among the 15&#8211;19 age group is high [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

We did not separate these adverse outcomes due to the limited event incidence of opioid overdose.

These variables were in a standard format and therefore comparable across states. We did not include race and ethnicity features due to lack of data availability. Based on the diagnosis codes available in the claims during the 6 months pre-surgery, we extracted 544 diagnosis features corresponding to the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) ICD-10-CM diagnosis categories (<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) and used the CCSR to identify diabetic, obese and depressed populations [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, 326 procedure features were extracted corresponding to the CCSR ICD-10-PCS procedure categories. We excluded those that were reported in less than 2% of patients. With a threshold of less than 2%, we are able to exclude features with very low prevalence, as they may not have enough variation to be useful for prediction and including them in the model may actually decrease its performance. This feature selection process resulted in 227 diagnosis features and 38 procedure features used as model inputs. In addition, type of surgery was used as a feature. Based on a combination of opioid and non-opioid prescription claims 6-months preceding surgery, a total of 46 prescription features were extracted. Patients who were not exposed to opioids during the 6 months period before surgery were classified as opioid na&#239;ve. Morphine milligram equivalent (MME) were computed using the CDC formula, as previously described in detail.<sup>18</sup> All features are described in <xref rid="pcbi.1011376.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Model development and construction</title><p>The primary goal was to predict 6-month postoperative risk of an OAO and the secondary goal was to predict risk of persistent opioid use. The steps for both prediction goals were the same. Medicaid data from 7 states were combined and then divided randomly into a training set comprising 90% of the data and a test set comprising 10%. We randomly sampled (stratifying by outcome) a training set from the cohort consisting of 90% of the data, the rest of the data being used as a testing set. Due to class imbalance, the pipelines consisted of a step of median imputation for missing values (for age, gender and urbanization status features), a step of standardization for numeric features, a step of minority class over-sampling with ratio 0.3, a step of majority class under-sampling with ratio 0.7 (resulting in a 41% outcome rate), followed by the machine learning model. We built our prediction models using multiple machine learning as well as deep learning methods: logistic regression and its variants Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net, random forest, extreme gradient boosted trees (xgboost) and a deep neural network approach. For all pipelines, hyperparameters were selected using a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation on the training data, optimizing for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Evaluation was done by comparing the means of these metrics. We reported AUC, precision, recall and F1 score to show the prediction ability. We prioritized AUC for comparison since it is threshold-independent, so that it measures the overall prediction ability of the model. The other metrics measure a snapshot of the model in the precision-recall trade-off. A precision-recall curve was generated for the best performing model for the primary outcome prediction.</p><p>To assess the calibration of the top performing model, we conducted several analyses. First, we calculated the calibration intercept and slope and generated calibration curves specific to each population. Additionally, we generated bootstrapped estimates of standard deviations for the overall calibration curve. The calibration intercept assesses whether risks are overestimated (intercept &lt;0) or underestimated (intercept &gt;0). An extreme slope leads to underestimation of low risks and overestimation of high risks, whereas a moderate slope results in overestimation of low risks and underestimation of high risks [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We used these metrics to evaluate the performance of our model.

We developed a machine learning approach to predict postoperative OAO in the Medicaid population. The models were reasonably calibrated, had good discrimination, and identified key features associated with OAO. The random forest model was best to distinguish between low and high-risk patients and thus had the highest potential clinical utility. If confirmed, these models could identify patients with a high risk of an OAO <italic toggle="yes">prior</italic> to surgery, increasing the care systems ability to change postoperative pain management among these high-risk patients to improve care outcomes, reduce unnecessary costs, and potentially reduce opioid misuse among this vulnerable population.</p><p>The models developed to predict OAO performed well, with AUC over 0.8. Previous opioid exposures (i.e., diagnosed opioid use disorder or high cumulative MME 6 months prior to surgery) were the strongest features associated with OAO. Although this is consistent with available literature,<sup>3,8</sup> the machine learning approach builds on this evidence to generate a risk score for OAO in Medicaid patients that can be used prior to surgery to improve patient outcomes. Importantly, the machine learning model highlights a combination of features predicting adverse outcomes far better than any one individual feature.</p><p>Other diagnoses also put the patients at higher risk for OAO. A prior history of diabetes, depression, and obesity increased the risk by 2-fold. Moreover, we found that OAO rates increased across the study period in all vulnerable populations whereas the rest of the population had decreasing OAO. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, these populations have increased healthcare needs and are at higher risk of adverse results after surgery that might require opiates [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Second, many of these patients are taking medications or have metabolic derangements that can complicate perioperative pain management [<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1011376.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This medical complexity could impact their pain management and opioid risk. These findings highlight how a machine learning approach can inform a practitioners approach pain management in unique populations and identify those that would most benefit from either increased monitoring, increased patient education, or reduced opioid dosing to improve outcomes, congruent with precision medicine initiatives.</p><p>Precision medicine considers the many variables that could affect the individual patient&#8217;s course to more accurately match their needs to therapy. The importance of these complex relationships is demonstrated by the machine learning models from this study, which are trained on 316 features. Machine learning gives a more nuanced picture than a simple binary outcome of a linear regression model. Models like random forests capture highly non-linear interactions of features and can take advantage of those interactions to predict the outcome. Therefore, one feature can have a positive influence on the outcome for some patients and a negative influence for others, depending on the feature&#8217;s complex interactions with other features. Shapley values provide a framework to explain the impacts on model outcomes of features while at the same time ranking features by importance. One example of this complexity was discharge daily MME, which is both a positive and negative predictor of OAO. This result means that discharge daily MME is important in pain response to surgery, but other factors importantly interact with discharge daily MME, influencing the outcomes.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First claims data do not provide functional measures, such as pain scores. However, we use a combination of prescriptions, encounters, and ICD codes to capture the patient care episode. Second, ICD codes for opioid abuse or overdose may be under-reported and do not distinguish between type of opioids, thus we cannot examine problems with prescribed opioid vs. illicit opioids. This likely means that models would perform better if there was less subjectivity in the outcomes. Finally, this study is based on data from seven states, therefore the results may not be generalizable to the entire Medicaid population. However, the data sets we have included are state-wide, geographically diverse and represent millions of Medicaid recipients. This allowed us to test the generalizability and robustness of our models across different states that were geographically diverse and had varying in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. This allowed us to test the performance of our models in a range of different contexts and to assess their ability to generalize to new settings.</p><p>In this study, we characterize OAO following surgery using Medicaid administrative data and highlight the increased rates of these events in vulnerable populations. We present a risk score developed on pre-operative data that has good discrimination and calibration, which could allow one to identify patients at high risk of OAO prior to surgery and allow for either tailored pain management or increased monitoring following surgery. The approach highlights known prediction factors but also leverages the combination of interactions between variables to improve patient discrimination. Developing a risk tool flagging patients at high risk for developing OAO in clinicians&#8217; workflow is crucial for optimizing treatment options and improving patient outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Type of surgical procedures included in the study with corresponding CCS procedure category.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Diagnosis Codes for Opioid Abuse, Dependence and Overdose from International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th and 10th Revision.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>CCSR diagnosis categories for the 3 vulnerable populations.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Description of features.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s004.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Hyperparameters found by grid search with 5-fold cross-validation (Python 3.6.9).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s005.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Model performance metrics for opioid abuse/dependence/overdose prediction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s006.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s007" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>Model performance metrics for persistent opioid use prediction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s007.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s008" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Flowchart for the study cohort.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s008.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1011376.s009" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Precision-recall curve for random forest model.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pcbi.1011376.s009.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi.1011376.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Abuse S.
