These complications could not only affect the patient immediately after surgery, but also have late repercussions, even death (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).&#160;These vary according to the type of surgery and post-operative care; however, a considerable proportion of these are related to infection of compromised structures before, during and after surgery (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Certain factors inherent to the critical condition of hospitalized patients must be considered, such as the presence of comorbidities, immunosuppression, the need for ventilatory support, the use of suction devices, feeding tubes, sedation, analgesia, and loss of protective reflexes as risk factors in the development of post operative complications (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Since all surgical procedures that require the use of general anesthesia compromise the respiratory system through permeabilization of the airways, it is expected that pneumonia is the most frequent postoperative complication (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Evidence shows that oral decay prior to surgery is an important risk factor in the development of multiple kinds of postoperative complications (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), associated with the fact that oral cavity presents a great variety of pathogenic agents, with several studies showing that the different oral structures are colonized by different types of bacterial and fungal communities. Some of the post operative complications described associated with oral cavity bacteria are postoperative pneumonia (PN), infectious endocarditis (IE), surgical site infection (SSI), prosthetic joint infection (PJI) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Perioperative oral management as a strategy to reduce the risk of oral bacteria colonization of structures has not been studied in depth as a protective factor prior to surgery to prevent the development of complications, as shown for example, by the fact that none of the predictive systems for postoperative risk consider the patient's oral health as a factor (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is also worth mentioning that there&#8217;s is no standardization even in surgeries where there is a relative consensus on the implementation of perioperative oral management as oncological surgery, thoracic surgery and prosthetic surgery, so that the techniques used depend on each clinician (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this review is to evaluate, according to the literature, the effectiveness of perioperative oral management on the risk reduction of developing postoperative complications in medical surgical procedures, and to compare the effectiveness of different perioperative oral maneuvers in reducing systemic postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>- Study Design</p><p>The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. Its structure is based on the PRISMA statement for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis and The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>- Research question</p><p>Our systematic review was conducted to answer the next question (designed using the PICO strategy): In patients undergoing hospital medical-surgical procedures, the application of preoperative oral practices reduces postoperative systemic complications?</p><p>Population (P): Patients undergoing hospital medical surgical procedures.</p><p>Intervention (I): Preoperative oral practices.</p><p>Control (C): Patients undergoing hospital medical surgical procedures not undergoing perioperative oral practices.</p><p>Outcome (O): Development of postoperative complications.</p><p>- Information search and strategy</p><p>To conduct this systematic review, four researchers independently used the MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Scielo electronic databases. Articles published between 2012 and 2022 were included. The databases were searched between October and November 2022. MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms classified into patient, intervention, and outcome were used; in addition, the boolean operators "AND", "OR" and "NOT" were used (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>- Inclusion criteria</p><p>A. English, Spanish or Portuguese language.</p><p>B. Up to 10 years.</p><p>C. Randomized clinical trials, non-randomized clinical trials, and analytical observational studies.</p><p>D. Adults.</p><p>E. Studies using or evaluating perioperative oral procedures/maneuvers before in-hospital medical-surgical procedures.</p><p>- Exclusion Criteria</p><p>A. Cross-sectional and case-control studies.</p><p>B. Studies that consider the management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation without prior medical surgical procedure.</p><p>C. Studies that only include head and neck surgery.</p><p>D. Studies that only include hygiene maneuvers like toothbrushing and mouthwashes or non-dental professional intervention.</p><p>E. Patients receiving oral care following surgery that includes procedures in addition to routine tooth brushing.</p><p>F. Studies that do not specify which perioperative oral maneuvers were performed.</p><p>G. Studies in which both groups underwent the same perioperative oral practices.</p><p>

</p><p>- Study selection</p><p>The researchers individually looked for articles in the different electronic databases, using combinations of the MeSH terms. The articles encountered were tabulated using the Google Spreadsheet and managed through the Mendeley 2.80.1.</p><p>- Data extraction</p><p>Four reviewers independently evaluated each of the titles and abstracts of the articles found according to the following steps: non-relevant articles were excluded; then the full texts were analyzed, discarding those that did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any discrepancies between the investigators were resolved through further analysis and discussion.</p><p>- Quality assessment</p><p>The studies resulting from the search were independently reviewed, and the risk of bias in the included studies was assessed. Data from studies with similar interventions and outcomes were grouped.</p><p>For the quality assessment, which focused on detecting the main sources of bias, it was necessary to establish a standardized approach prior to the assessment. Discrepancies were settled through discussion and consensus. For this analysis, Newcastle Ottawa scale (NCO) for nonrandomized studies was used.</p><p>- Outcome Measures</p><p>The following study variables were identified:&#160;</p><p>1. Place where the study was conducted.</p><p>2.The number of selected groups and participants.</p><p>3. Perioperative oral maneuvers performed.</p><p>4. Medical-surgical procedure performed.</p><p>5. Type of postoperative complications developed.</p><p>6. Measures of effect on the development of postoperative complications.</p><p>- Statistical Analysis</p><p>The measures of effects were considered according to study design and type of variable. In this case, Relative Risk (RR) was used, under a 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model to incorporate heterogeneity. A <italic toggle="yes">p-value</italic> of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statistical test and the X2 test with a value of &lt;0.05. The studies and analyses were subsequently presented in forest plots, subdivided in type of perioperative oral practice. The RevMan tool (Review Management 5.4) was employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>- Results of the study selection process</p><p>A total of 1470 articles were identified, of which 165 duplicate articles were discarded, yielding a total of 1305 studies remaining. Subsequently, the analysis of the titles and abstracts of the resulting studies yielded a total of 101 articles after applying the inclusion criteria. Then, exclusion criteria were applied, finally obtaining 13 articles included in the systematic review, and of these, 10 were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The reasons for the exclusion of articles from the systematic review were mainly divided into:&#160;</p><p>1. Oral post-operative management was performed [3].</p><p>2. The study subjects did not undergo surgery, but only assisted ventilation [16].</p><p>3. The format of the perioperative oral care procedures is not specified [3].</p><p>4. Only surgeries involving the head and neck were considered [15].</p><p>5. The study design does not comply with what was considered for the selection of the articles [2].</p><p>6. Studies in which both groups underwent the same perioperative oral practices [2].</p><p>7. Studies only included hygiene maneuvers or non-dental professional intervention [47].</p><p>

</p><p>- Comparation between FA and CA</p><p>FA and CA showed statistically significant results as protective factors against the development of postoperative complications in most studies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Regarding the relevant differences between both protocols, CA considers a greater number of procedures, as well as an integral approach of the oral health of patients, considering definitive restorations such as composites and crowns. On the other hand, FA only considers control of infection foci, such as extractions, periodontal treatment and hygiene, procedures that also are considered in CA. Only Rao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) compared CA and FA, and obtained results according to the type of postoperative complication: the patients of the FA group developed less PN (OR= 3.65; [95% CI= 1.96-6.78 ]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01), while the patients of the CA group developed less sepsis (OR=2.77; [95% CI=1.55-4.95]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.006), while there were no statistically significant differences in the development of IE (OR= 2.49, [95% CI= 0.70-8.86], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.159). Another study that modified two protocols corresponds to Kontansty <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which compared CA vs. incomplete CA, without specifying what maneuvers were not completed in the procedures. Complete AC showed a lower risk in the development of postoperative complications compared to incomplete AC (OR= 6.1; [95% CI = 1.06-35.00]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.042).</p><p>- Development of postoperative complications</p><p>The total sample among the 13 studies included 34.946 patients, of whom 1010 (2.89%) developed some form of complication after surgery. Of these, 17.791 underwent perioperative oral interventions, while 17.042 did not undergo any. Of the patients who underwent perioperative oral management, 407 developed complications, while in the unexposed group 603 did.</p><p>Postoperative pneumonia was the most reported complication, being reported in 9 of the 13 studies. Diagnostic criteria were chest radiographic opacity, fever, leukocytosis, or leukopenia, and purulent sputum (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Only one study specified severity criteria, as in the case of Sato <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), who diagnosed according to Clavien-Dindo Classification. Three studies did not specify their diagnostic criteria (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Postoperative pneumonia was reported in patients undergoing oncologic surgery of different structures, mainly of the thoracic structures (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), in some cases also heart surgery (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), abdominal oncologic surgery and structures of other systems (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The second most reported complication in the literature was surgical site infection (SSI). Diagnostic criteria were purulent discharge remaining from the operative wound, and the presence of culture-positive bacteria (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The surgeries that reported the occurrence of this complication were colorectal oncologic surgeries (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and heart valve surgeries (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Only two studies reported infective endocarditis as a postoperative complication, both being associated with heart and valve surgery (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The following criteria were used for diagnosis: infection (confirmed by the presence of fever &gt; 38&#176;C), wheezing, and leukocytosis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Other complications were reported: 1 study reported prosthetic joint infection in prosthetic surgery and its diagnosis criteria was based on Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and one study reported sepsis as postoperative complication in cardiac surgery (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but its diagnostic criteria were not specified.</p><p>- Quantitative analysis of the data (meta-analysis)</p><p>Perioperative dental practices on the incidence of postoperative complications</p><p>Random effect was used.

</p><p>- Level of evidence analysis</p><p>This review included mostly observational studies in its analysis, which means that it starts from a low level of evidence. In the risk assessment using NCO, the studies with the highest weight achieved a high score, implying a low risk of bias. The confidence intervals of the pooled association measure of the studies in their quantitative analysis were consistently shown to be on the benefit side. The studies showed heterogeneity among them. The confidence intervals for the measures of effect were narrow. It was not possible detect serious publication bias.</p><p>Quantitative analysis also showed a strong association between decreased risk of developing complications and the application of perioperative oral practices (RR=0.48, [95% CI 0.36 - 0.63]). On the other hand, the studies controlled confounding variables through statistical methods; however, no study analyzed the dose-response gradient or the long-term effect of the application of perioperative oral practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the results of 13 studies conducted in China, Japan, USA, and Poland (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) were analyzed, which sought to test the effect of perioperative oral practices (CA and FA) on the incidence of postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery.</p><p>The quantitative analysis showed that perioperative oral practices are a clinically significant protective factor against the development of postoperative complications (RR=0.48, [95% CI 0.36 - 0.63]) such as pneumonia, surgical site infection, and endocarditis. This could be explained by the fact that the oral cavity is a reservoir of microorganisms that can cause infection in adjacent or remote organs. Four biological mechanisms could induce the appearance of infectious conditions associated with oral microbiota: direct transfer of oral bacteria, which may be implicated in upper respiratory tract infections and SSI in head and neck oncologic surgeries; intravascular invasion of bacteria, which is transferred to the blood and lymphatic vessels, colonizing remote structures; the passage of endotoxins through blood and lymphatic vessels; and the direct ingestion of oral pathogens that can alter the intestinal microbiota (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the first two being the most relevant in the development of postoperative complications.</p><p>Poor oral hygiene can lead to periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of a reservoir of complex microbiological communities. Periodontal pockets can serve as a reservoir of potential pathogens for respiratory tract infections, which can penetrate the adjacent microvasculature and lead to bacteremia. Therefore, by performing perioperative clinical oral care, the microbiological load is reduced, controlling bacteremia, and therefore reducing the risk of postoperative complications (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Nosocomial infections are one of the most important contributors to patient morbidity and mortality, significantly increasing hospitalization time and total costs. As an example, deep sternal infection (a type of SSI) in open-heart surgery in Denmark has an estimated cost per treatment of &#8364;40,000; hence, it is in this context that perioperative oral care practices take on special clinical and practical importance (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). For this reason, the importance of the elimination of infectious foci before major surgeries has been previously investigated (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which can be traced back to classical considerations, where well-established protocols detail the elimination of infectious foci as a requirement prior to the start of some surgeries or invasive therapies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For example, it has been reported that, in patients undergoing elective spinal surgery, 47% of patients who develop SSI suffer from some degree of periodontitis or that in patients undergoing liver transplantation, poor oral health is an important factor in the development of postoperative complications (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), with more studies reaching similar conclusions, regarding different types of procedures (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Pneumonia was the most reported complication in oncologic and heart surgery, this has been associated with various factors, such as the level of immune compromise, the transfer of bacteria from the oral cavity and adjacent structures to the upper airway through the implementation of assisted ventilation, and poor oral condition (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Several studies have reported that patients with poor oral hygiene have significantly higher rates of pneumonia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, research has been conducted to determine which perioperative oral practices are necessary prior to mechanical intubation of patients. This is complex in emergency procedures, such as immediate intubation after severe complications associated with acute respiratory conditions, where it is impossible to carry out the planned oral procedures described in the present study. This takes on importance in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemia, where patients often require immediate mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>The second most reported complication corresponded to SSI (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), in which the described mechanism corresponds to the transition of oral bacteria through blood and lymphatic pathways, leading to colonization of the surgical site. This complication is common in gastrointestinal or liver surgeries, so the use of minimally invasive methods, such as laparoscopic surgery, has become an attractive option (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>When comparing perioperative oral practices versus no action, these proved to be an effective maneuver in reducing the development of postoperative complications (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The perioperative oral care protocol with the greatest impact in the literature corresponded to FA, which is not only supported by the literature presented in this review (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and meta-analysis (RR=0.50, [95% CI= 0.38 - 0.63]), but also by its incorporation as a policy in the Japanese public system (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is important to emphasize this point, since patients undergoing CA are exposed to greater morbidity, greater private or fiscal expenditure in their approach, and extensive time requirements for their implementation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), so when evaluating the clinical significance of each of the protocols, it is important to consider whether it is convenient to apply more complex practices with similar results.</p><p>The surgery with the greatest evidence and effectiveness of the perioperative oral procedures in reduction of postoperative complications corresponded to oncological surgery (RR=0.43, [95% CI= 0.37-0.50]). Several studies have reported poor oral health as a risk factor in the development of postoperative complications in oncological surgery for the treatment of tumors that compromise the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx, and esophagus (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Elimination of infectious foci is necessary prior to head and neck oncological surgery in established protocols (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but evidence is limited on surgeries of other structures. This review shows the importance of oral health in the post-surgical evolution of patients undergoing oncological surgeries of gastrointestinal and thoracic structures.</p><p>The evaluation of bias in observational and quasi-experimental analytical studies is complex to perform because there are a series of variables that the researcher does not handle, and tools used in experimental designs to evaluate them are difficult to apply; Therefore, the Newcastle Ottawa scale was used because it is the most commonly used for cohort designs and provides an approximation of the biases of each study, according to the score in the scale. In the bias analysis, the studies with the highest significance showed a low risk of bias. When evaluating quality of the evidence (based on the criteria proposed by GRADE (10), given the study design and the effective fulfillment of GRADE criteria such as consistency, precision, certainty, and low risk of publication bias, added to the adequate management of confounding factors, the level of evidence should at least be considered low. Evidence suggests that perioperative oral practices reduce postoperative complications in medical-surgical procedures, but more randomized clinical studies are needed in order to obtain conclusive results.</p><p>The findings in the present study could be extrapolated to those described by Pedersen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) in a systematic review on the effectiveness of different clinical practices of oral-dental care in the reduction of postoperative complications in adult thoracic surgery, where mainly antibiotic and hygiene protocols were used, in which similar results were obtained (RR=0.48 [95% CI=0.27-0.84]), concluding that perioperative oral management corresponds to a protective factor against the development of complications. However, other studies have concluded that in certain types of surgeries the evidence does not support the importance of perioperative clinical practices in the development of complications. Lockhart <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), in an extensive review, which evaluated the effectiveness of perioperative dental management in reducing complications in heart valve surgery concerning the development of IE (RR=1.01 [95% CI=0.76-1.33]), concluded that there were no significant differences in the reduction of complications in patients on whom perioperative oral practices were performed. It should be noted that in the quantitative analysis, only three studies were included. It should be considered that in our review there are only few studies where cardiac surgery has been performed.</p><p>Another type of surgery where the evidence is inconclusive corresponds to prosthetic surgeries, as shown by Barrere <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) in their systematic review, where they conclude that there is no substantial evidence to support that there is a reduction in postoperative complications associated with prosthetic surgeries, even suggesting that preoperative oral maneuvers could have an overestimated effect in reducing postoperative complications. In this case, the authors emphasize that the evidence they had was extremely heterogeneous, and that none of the research they analyzed really answered their research question. Other factors that should be considered is that a considerable part of their methodological designs correspond to case series (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These results contrast with those of our review, considering that the only study that performed preoperative oral maneuvers in patients undergoing prosthetic surgery obtained no statistically significant results, in contrast to oncological surgeries, where the evidence of our review convincingly shows the importance of perioperative oral care in reduction of the risk of developing postoperative complications.</p><p>A limitation of our review is that most of the studies were carried out in Japan. Moreover, certain authors tend to show up repeatedly within the authors of the studies such as Hasegawa T and Nobuhara H (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We evaluate a possible overlapping of sample, causing an overrepresentation of the effect, but the studies include patients with different pathologies or different hospitals. Therefore, the sample units are not repeated between one study and the other.</p><p>A possible explanation for the large number of Japanese studies is that in Japan, universal care was implemented in 1961, and from that moment on, the country&#8217;s health indicators have gradually improved, and consequently, the government has placed the focus on increasing the number of human resources in health, as well as investing in training for medical and health personnel. Concerning oral health, since 1989, education and prevention activities have steadily increased, and as a result, there has been an improvement in the Japanese population's awareness of the importance of oral health (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In 2012, Perioperative Oral Management (POM) was introduced into the Japanese universal health insurance system to prevent postoperative complications in cancer patients undergoing surgery. This refers to out-of-hospital oral care provided by a dentist prior to in-hospital medical-surgical treatment, which includes a complete dental evaluation and the corresponding dental treatment in cases of high risk of infection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The purpose of this is to ensure adequate oral health conditions at the time of surgery. Due to the importance given to public dental policies in Japan, a considerable number of the studies reviewed in the present meta-analysis are from this country, considering that the access to the hospitals, records and patients is easier, promoting the investigation in this area. Taking this into account, this review reveals the need to carry out further research in this area, unifying methodologies that will allow comparisons between different countries, not only Asian ones. Studies should also be carried out to compare FA and CA techniques, as well as to identify and study other protocols. In addition, a comparison could be made between the use of mouthwashes or antiseptics such as chlorhexidine with perioperative oral management, although they are different in concept, considering that there is ample evidence about its effectiveness in the reduction of postoperative complications as a hygiene procedure (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It is also advisable to carry out an economic analysis to evaluate the cost-benefit of implementing these protocols in public and private services.</p><p>In conclusion, the rating of the evidence collected is low because of the types of designs. However, the evidence suggests that perioperative oral care practices, in particular FA reduce postoperative complications after medical surgical procedures, particularly in oncological surgical procedures, the perioperative oral maneuver with more evidence was FA. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the implementation of perioperative clinical protocols as a public policy to reduce the risk of postoperative complications in patients who will undergo medical-surgical procedures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors contributions Fabi&#225;n Camus Jansson: Conceived of the presented idea; verified the analytical methods; designed and run the search strategy; selected the papers included in this review; classified the results and made a qualitative analysis of the information; discussed the results and contributed to the final manuscript.
