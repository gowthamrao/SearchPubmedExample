(AUD). Understanding patient perspectives of a period of abstinence may assist
persons with AUD in achieving this goal. We accessed the electronic health
records of adults with AUD entering an emergency department in Baltimore,
Maryland, who received a brief peer support intervention for substance use. Data
contained open-ended text entered by staff after a patient indicated ever having
a sustained period of substance abstinence. Using qualitative template analysis
methodology, we identified codes and themes from these open-ended responses from
N&#8201;=&#8201;153 adults with AUD. The sample was primarily male (n&#8201;=&#8201;109, 71.2%) and
White (n&#8201;=&#8201;98, 64.1%) with an average age of 43.8&#8201;years (SD&#8201;=&#8201;11.2). Themes
identified included the abstinence length, abstinence reason, relapse, triggers,
time of relapse, and treatment. The most common code for abstinence length was
&#8220;between 1 and 5&#8201;years&#8221; (n&#8201;=&#8201;55, 35.9%). Other abstinence length codes included
&#8220;less than 1&#8201;year&#8221; and &#8220;more than 5&#8201;years.&#8221; Relapse triggers included &#8220;family
(non-death),&#8221; &#8220;death of a loved one,&#8221; &#8220;social,&#8221; &#8220;economic,&#8221; and
&#8220;treatment-related&#8221; reasons. Findings from this study could be used to inform
strategies for peer support interventions to assist patients with substance
abstinence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alcohol use disorder</kwd><kwd>abstinence</kwd><kwd>emergency department</kwd><kwd>qualitative</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-11782218231162468"><funding-source id="funding1-11782218231162468"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-11782218231162468">R03DA048913</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-11782218231162468"><funding-source id="funding2-11782218231162468"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-11782218231162468">T32DA007209</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-11782218231162468"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2021, over 29 million people aged 12&#8201;years and older met criteria for having an
alcohol use disorder (AUD).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> AUD is associated with harmful outcomes including increased

AUD.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Further, AUD may precipitate
the onset and increased severity of co-occurring mental disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr12-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Given these harmful
consequences, reducing the negative impact of AUD is vital for the well-being of
persons affected by AUD as well as their families and communities.</p><p>Abstaining from alcohol decreases harmful outcomes such as cardiac
arrhythmia<sup><xref rid="bibr13-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and coronary heart disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although alcohol abstinence
among people with AUD may result in severe withdrawal symptoms (e.g. seizures and
delirium tremens) including some necessitating emergency care, clinical benefits of
abstinence can be achieved with appropriate medical monitoring and pharmacologic
support.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> While abstinence from alcohol is a valuable clinical goal for
some persons,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> harm reduction through decreased drinking is a valuable
clinical goal for others.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Similarly, because AUD is a chronic condition, a period of
abstinence may be followed by a lapse (restarting the use of a substance) or relapse
(returning to similar patterns of substance use).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Alternatively, some persons
with AUD may experience long-term periods of abstinence from alcohol after the first
treatment attempt. Thus, there is no &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach to reduce the
harmful consequences of alcohol use. Given this variability and medical complexity,
understanding periods of abstinence among persons with AUD may provide critical
insights for future treatment, particularly in settings that provide acute treatment
and referral to specialty care.</p><p>Emergency departments (EDs) provide acute treatment and referrals. These services are
often provided for patients with AUD or AUD-related injuries and medical
conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr24-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Annual
alcohol-related visits to the ED cost approximately 1.2&#8201;billion USD and
significantly impact medical services.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Although persons with acute
AUD-related conditions may utilize emergency services for their care, other
treatment and service options exist including community-based inpatient services,
outpatient services, and self-help groups. According to the National Survey of Drug
Use and Health, in 2021, approximately 2 million people received substance use
treatment from self-help groups in the U.S.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Self-help groups include
Self-Management and Recovery Training and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). AA uses social
exchange and incorporates the 12-step recovery model which focuses on abstinence
from alcohol.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Despite these
available support options in the community, including the widespread presence of AA
groups, for many, the ED remains their first contact with AUD treatment
infrastructure. Thus, understanding experiences of persons with AUD in the ED may
facilitate increased contact with community treatment and decrease ED utilization
and costs among these persons. These insights may inform what individuals are
seeking and what should be offered/promoted in community treatment.</p><p>The present study used qualitative template analysis methodology to explore themes
from open-ended responses about previous periods of abstinence during admissions to
the ED.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Template
analysis provides a structured approach for analyzing qualitative data and
extracting common themes. Systematically capturing the perspectives and experiences
of abstinence, especially relapse triggers, may facilitate development of
interventions to support adults with AUD who are striving toward sustained
abstinence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-11782218231162468"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-11782218231162468"><title>Emergency department intervention</title><p>The present study evaluated data from the Screening, Brief Intervention, and
Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program for substance use disorders implemented by
the Johns Hopkins Bayview Emergency Department. Intervention data are entered
into the electronic health record (Epic Systems) by ED staff, including triage
nurses and peer recovery specialists. New admissions to the ED are screened by
the triage nurse for illicit substance use during the past 12&#8201;months or a score
of &#10878; 7 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), a
3-item brief screener for at-risk alcohol use ranging 0-12 with higher scores
indicating greater at-risk use.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Individuals who meet
either of these criteria are seen by a peer recovery specialist and receive a
brief intervention. The peer recovery specialists ask patients both closed- and
open-ended questions about substance use, treatment history, and social support
to determine if a referral to substance use treatment is necessary. Peer
recovery specialists work with the patient&#8217;s medical team to refer the patient
to treatment if needed. After the patient is discharged from the ED, the peer
recovery specialist will follow-up to determine if they were successfully linked
to treatment after the referral.</p></sec><sec id="section4-11782218231162468"><title>Sample</title><p>Data for the present analysis were extracted from the electronic health record

received a referral to treatment from the ED SBIRT program from July 1, 2017 to
July 1, 2019. Extracted data included standardized closed- and open-ended items
such as basic demographic information (e.g. age, sex, race, and ethnicity),
substance use history, and other variables assessed by the peer recovery
specialists (e.g. barriers to treatment, whether patient attended treatment). A
quantitative analysis on factors associated with linkage to treatment following
ED referral was conducted in a separate study.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The present study focused
on items regarding substance abstinence. Specifically, during the brief
intervention, the peer recovery specialist is prompted by a standardized form
with the question, &#8220;Has the patient ever had sustained abstinence?&#8221; The peer
recovery specialist responds to this question with a dichotomous option of &#8220;Yes&#8221;
or &#8220;No.&#8221; An affirmative response is followed by an open-ended text-box that the
peer recovery specialist asks about and then records a description of the prior
period of sustained abstinence. This period of sustained abstinence was open to
the patient&#8217;s own personal interpretation. The sample for the present study
includes all patients during the query period that met the following criteria:
(1) were included in the quantitative dataset,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (2) had an AUD diagnosis

fictional data unrelated to this study&#8217;s topic area. A study dictionary was
created with relevant terms to assist the study team in reading through the
open-ended narratives. Words in the study dictionary included names of treatment
facilities in the greater Baltimore area (which were often referenced in the
narratives), medical abbreviations, and terms colloquially used among recovery
circles (e.g. sober, sponsor).</p><p>The research team coded the data guided by 2 research questions: &#8220;How long was
their period of abstinence?&#8221; and &#8220;What were the triggers that caused them to
relapse?&#8221; To answer question 1, 2 codes were initially used, which included
&#8220;Abstinence Length: Between 1 and 5&#8201;years&#8221; and &#8220;Abstinence Length: More than
5&#8201;years.&#8221; A code for less than 1&#8201;year of abstinence was added as an emerging
theme. Other emerging themes and codes that were unrelated to the primary
questions were also identified and coded. All N&#8201;=&#8201;153 narratives were separated
into 5 batches. Each batch was coded separately by the 3 primary coders. After
coding each batch, the research team would meet to discuss and compare all codes
and themes and update the coding template accordingly. After coding the final
batch, the research team used the final template to add codes to previous
batches. Depending on the content of the narrative, individual narratives could
contain multiple codes. Example narratives presented in this article were
derived from de-identified data, but additional changes were made where
necessary to further protect privacy prior to inclusion as exemplars in the
manuscript. For example, exact interpersonal relationships may have been altered
(e.g. &#8220;family member&#8221; in place of &#8220;daughter&#8221;) and specific treatment facilities
were redacted. The Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board reviewed
the extraction of these data and determined the project to be exempt
research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section6-11782218231162468"><title>Results</title><sec id="section7-11782218231162468"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p><xref rid="table1-11782218231162468" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> describes
the sample. Patients had an average age of 43.8&#8201;years (SD&#8201;=&#8201;11.2) and were
primarily male (n&#8201;=&#8201;109, 71.2%) and White (n&#8201;=&#8201;98, 64.1%). Most of the sample
were unemployed (n&#8201;=&#8201;100, 65.4%) and approximately a quarter requested
assistance with locating housing services (n&#8201;=&#8201;40, 26.1%) while in the ED. A
majority of the sample were previously treated for substance use (n&#8201;=&#8201;121,
79.1%) and were successfully linked to treatment following the ED referral
according to data entered by the peer recovery specialists (n&#8201;=&#8201;109, 71.2%). The
mean AUDIT-C score was 9.0 (SD&#8201;=&#8201;4.7) with a Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of .99.
Self-reported substance use other than alcohol during the past 12&#8201;months
included heroin (n&#8201;=&#8201;26, 17.0%), cocaine (n&#8201;=&#8201;22, 14.4%), and cannabis (n&#8201;=&#8201;19,

During the coding process, other emerging themes from the open-ended narratives

relapse triggers which may be useful to address when supporting persons trying to

is reflected in the discussions of many recovery groups, in which the concept of
&#8220;taking it 1&#8201;day at a time&#8221; has been described for decades.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Each day
is often celebrated as another victory when trying to overcome the chronic
illness of a substance use disorder. One implication of our observations related
to the duration of prior abstinence is that a dichotomous (&#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;)
question as to whether a patient had a prior period of abstinence is
insufficient if the desire is for clinicians or researchers to capture only
extended periods of abstinence. Given that the duration of abstinence is a known
predictor of long-term recovery related outcomes such as overall health,
financial status, and social support, greater precision is warranted when
assessing the importance of prior periods of abstinence during brief
intervention programs.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section35-11782218231162468"><title>Abstinence reason</title><p>The reason for abstinence varied and, in some cases, multiple reasons for
abstinence were described. Willpower, employment, incarceration, and hobbies
were the most often identified reasons for abstinence. Willpower was the most
identified reason for abstinence. Although the construct of willpower is
nebulous and lacking in formal empirical characterization, it is sometimes
characterized as the use of internal strengths to avoid using a
substance.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Potentially related constructs of self-regulation and
self-efficacy are associated with substance use abstinence.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>
Strengths-based approaches allow clinicians to focus on an individual&#8217;s
strengths when addressing an issue such as overcoming a substance use disorder.
Clinicians may be able to assist people interested in abstinence by identifying
their specific strengths such as willpower and self-regulation, making patients
aware of these strengths, devising plans to use their strengths to achieve
abstinence, and reinforcing these strengths via positive feedback.</p><p>We interpreted the employment and hobbies codes as dedicating time to
non-substance-related activities, which may increase the capacity to avoid
substance use. This is in line with theoretical and empirical research
suggesting that increasing access to reinforcing or enjoyable non-drug-related
activities can support long-term recovery.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The present analyses
highlight that employment and hobbies may be valuable alternative reinforcers
that could be leveraged to promote abstinence. Considering that over 65% of our
sample were unemployed, the ED could be an important environment to refer
patients to outside agencies that provide employment training services. Our
evaluation of relapse demonstrated the need to tailor treatment approaches and
referrals according to individual patient needs.</p></sec><sec id="section36-11782218231162468"><title>Time of relapse and relapse triggers</title><p>Time of relapse ranged from 1&#8201;day to 27&#8201;years prior to their ED visit, which
corresponds to potentially different readiness to change and likelihood of
medically significant withdrawal. Reasons for relapse included family stressors,
grief, social, economic, and treatment-related reasons. Family and couples
counseling may be an effective way to address family stressors and improve
substance use related outcomes for adults with an AUD and their
families<sup><xref rid="bibr43-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and could be considered as an avenue for treatment
referrals from the ED. Stress management techniques may also be beneficial when
encountering family related and other general stressors. The need for
bereavement support was also identified in this sample, given that death of a
loved one was identified as a reason for relapse. While treatment-related
reasons, such as treatment discharge, were identified as a reason for relapse,
receipt of treatment was associated with sustained abstinence.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section37-11782218231162468"><title>Treatment</title><p>The data identified several codes for attending treatment, being abstinent during

with AUD collected in a real-world brief intervention occurring in the ED and
identified several clinical needs that may shape future referral to treatment
programs. The present analysis should be interpreted in the context of both
strengths and limitations. The patients included in this sample were adults with
AUD who received treatment in an urban ED and who were documented as having
attended or not attended subsequent treatment. Although these characteristics
allowed us to focus on abstinence and relapse for patients with AUD (who may
have unique and medically significant abstinence concerns), and allowed us to
describe the overall referral to treatment success of this sub-group, these
characteristics may not be generalizable to all populations. Another limitation
is the retrospective nature of this study examining preexisting electronic
health records rather than structured interviews with patients. Further,
abstinence, the focus of the present study, has been criticized as only 1
dimension of successful recovery from AUD<sup><xref rid="bibr49-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> with controlled drinking
or other harm reduction as alternative clinical goals.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-11782218231162468" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, there were
no questions in this secondary dataset that could be analyzed to assess
controlled drinking. Future qualitative research may compare controlled drinking
and abstinence goals among persons with AUD. The weaknesses of the study are
offset by the fact that the data were collected from a large sample of
open-ended responses collected by real-world clinicians implementing a
structured brief intervention interview that was integrated into the electronic
health record. The use of a standardized data set from peer recovery coach
workflows in the ED performing usual clinical care contributes to the external
validity and real-world implications of our findings. Thus, the present paper
provides individuals with a goal of abstinence and their providers with
considerations for brief intervention, referral to treatment, and long-term
considerations for AUD recovery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section39-11782218231162468"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Different themes emerged when examining prior periods of abstinence. Our foci were
abstinence length and relapse triggers. In our sample, we found that reported
abstinence length varied considerably from 6&#8201;days to more than 5&#8201;years. This broad
variability points to the experiences of abstinence. Relapse triggers were
thematically family, death of a loved one, social, economic, and treatment related.
Stressors related to these themes should be screened for and addressed when service
providers and clinicians provide services to individuals abstaining from substance
use. An example may include screening for the recent death of a loved one and
providing a referral to individual or group bereavement therapy. As it relates to
family as a relapse trigger, interventions could be tailored to an individual and
may include trauma-focused individual therapy, identifying stress reduction
strategies, couples/family therapy, or support groups. Relapse triggers are
multiple, variable, and compounding, and there is additional need to empirically
