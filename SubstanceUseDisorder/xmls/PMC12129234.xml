Previous literature showed that initiation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants concomitantly with existing CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction) was associated with heightened risks of adverse outcomes (e.g., worsening pain). However, little is known about whether and to what extent the risks exist when CYP2D6-metabolized opioids are initiated on existing antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction), a more common pattern of concomitant use of these two drugs. The study aims to examine the association of initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with risks of adverse outcomes among older nursing home residents who already received antidepressants.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a 100% Medicare nursing home sample linked to Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021. Participants included long-term care residents 65 years of age or older who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants for at least 30 days. The key exposure was the use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, with day 1 of antidepressant-opioid concomitant use designated as cohort entry. Patients were followed from cohort entry until the end of 1 year, nursing home discharge, death, or study end (12/31/2021). Seven adverse outcomes included worsening pain, physical function, and depression, and counts of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose (OD). We identified 127,200 older nursing home long-term residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants (mean [SD] age, 84.4 [8.7] years). After covariate adjustment via inverse probability of treatment weighting, use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with a higher risk of worsening pain (relative risk:1.04 [95% CI, 1.02, 1.06]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001; risk difference (RD): 1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%, 1.6%]) and a higher incidence rate of pain-related hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR]:1.13 [95% CI, 1.04, 1.22]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003; RD: 1.21 [95% CI, 0.39, 1.89] per 1,000 patient-years) and pain-related ED visits (IRR&#8201;=&#8201;1.17 [95% CI, 1.07, 1.29]; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003; RD: 0.85 [95% CI, 0.29, 1.41] per 1,000 patient-years), with no difference in physical function, depression, OUD, and OD. Main study limitations included unmeasured confounding and limited generalizability.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This cohort study of older nursing home residents showed that initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with increased risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalizations, and pain-related ED visits, although the relative and absolute risks are small to moderate.

Over 90% of older nursing home residents with opioid therapy received opioids (i.e., hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol, and oxycodone) metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 enzyme for managing pain [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Because CYP2D6 is a major metabolic enzyme of these opioids to active or potent analgesic metabolites [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], concomitant use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with medications that inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme, such as certain antidepressants, may cause inadequate analgesia. The reduction in analgesic effects associated with opioid-antidepressant interaction results in worsening of pain [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and persistent pain can lead to increased risk for impaired physical functioning and mental health problems, including depression [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The reduction in analgesic effects can also result in opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs), including pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department [ED] visits) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The safety of pharmacokinetic opioid-antidepressant interactions can be affected by the sequence in which drug is initiated. The interactions can be triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants among patients who already received CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction). Because this group already used opioids, antidepressant-triggered interactions may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms from decreased analgesia of opioids, heightening risks of not only worsening pain but also pain-related medical encounters, as demonstrated in prior studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, the interactions can be triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids among patients who already received antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction). When patients initiate CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while still on antidepressants, they may encounter adverse events (e.g., worsening pain) likely due to decreased analgesia from the antidepressant-opioid interaction but have no immediate concern for opioid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Today, little is known whether and to what extent the risks of adverse outcomes are associated with pharmacokinetic antidepressant-opioid interactions triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids among older nursing home residents. Our prior study has examined adverse outcomes associated with the interactions triggered by initiation of antidepressants [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, these patients constitute only 20% of older nursing home patients who concomitantly used both CYP2D6-metabolized opioids and antidepressants according to our preliminary data using the 100% nursing home sample [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The predominant (80%) concomitant users of both drugs in nursing homes are patients who already received antidepressants followed by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, which has not yet been studied.</p><p>Using a national nursing home sample, we aimed to study the safety of pharmacokinetic antidepressant-opioid interactions triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids among older patients who were already receiving antidepressants. Following our prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we compared three key clinical outcomes (i.e., pain intensity, physical function, and depression) and four ORAE outcomes (i.e., opioid-related hospitalizations and ED visits, opioid use disorder [OUD], and opioid overdose [OD]) among patients with CYP2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants, concomitantly used with newly-prescribed CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. We hypothesize that concomitant use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with risks of clinical and ORAE outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Study source and design</title><p>This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from a 100% nursing home resident sample linked to Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021. Medicare claims data contain fee-for-service beneficiaries&#8217; medical billing records for Parts A (inpatient), B (office-based visits), and D (prescription drugs). We used Medicare Part D data to measure concomitant antidepressant-opioid use (key exposure) and used Parts A and B to ascertain key ORAE outcomes. The MDS 3.0 assessment is required at admission, regular intervals during a Medicare-covered short-term stay, and quarterly thereafter [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We used MDS 3.0 assessments to measure key clinical outcomes (pain intensity, physical function, and depressive symptoms) and important covariates, such as cognitive function, body mass index, and use of as-needed (PRN) pain medications among residents with a long-term stay (&gt;100 days).

Cohort entry was defined as day 1 of antidepressant and opioid concomitant use. Initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was defined as having no such prescription filled within 180 days before cohort entry (i.e., baseline). To minimize confounding by disease conditions, we restricted the study sample to those with a diagnosis of chronic pain for opioid therapy initiation within 1 month and conditions that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or off-label use for antidepressants within 6 months before the cohort entry. Residents were followed up from cohort entry until the end of 1-year follow-up, Medicare disenrollment, death, nursing home discharge, or study end (December 31, 2021).</p><p>To ensure comparability with our prior study that examined opioid-antidepressant interactions triggered by initiation of antidepressants [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study that examined the interactions triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. Specifically, to ensure complete capture of baseline medical and prescription claims and MDS data for measuring key variables of interest, we required residents to have (1) continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A, B, and D, without a Medicare Advantage plan; (2) no hospital or skilled nursing facility stay, during which Medicare-covered services are unavailable due to CMS&#8217;s prospective payment system policy [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; (3) &#8805;1 MDS assessment; (4) continuous nursing home stay; (5) no diagnosis of cancer or palliative or hospice care; and (6) no coma or severe cognitive impairment (defined as having a Cognitive Performance Scale score of 5 or 6) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], assessed using the MDS assessments, during 6 months before cohort entry. The last criterion was used because clinical pain and depression symptoms among residents with coma or severe cognitive impairment tend to be under-detected [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and their risk for ORAEs is rare.</p><p>The final sample was used for analyses of ORAE outcomes, and a subset of the final sample who had&#8201;&#8805;1 MDS assessment in follow-up was used to measure clinical outcome changes.

Antidepressants that moderately or strongly inhibit CYP2D6 enzyme (i.e., fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, doxepin, and bupropion) were classified as CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants; otherwise, as CYP-neutral antidepressants (<xref rid="pmed.1004620.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The classification of antidepressants was made based on multiple sources of drug interactions, including the US FDA [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Micromedex, Lexicomp, and Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For each drug, we determined days of drug use according to days&#8217; supply and dispending date of prescriptions. We then constructed episodes of concomitant opioid-antidepressant use by identifying the continuous number of overlapping days on which a CYP2D6-metabolized opioid was used along with an antidepressant drug. When constructing episodes of concomitant opioid-antidepressant use, we allowed a gap of fewer than 15 days to account for delays in fills of prescription drugs of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Adverse outcomes</title><p>Following our prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we studied three clinical measures&#8212;worsening pain intensity, physical function, and depression status, all of which were obtained from MDS 3.0 and 4 ORAE measures&#8212;pain-related hospitalization and ED visits, OUD, and OD, all of which were assessed using Medicare claims data (<xref rid="pmed.1004620.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Pain-related hospitalization and ED visits were defined as encounters with a primary or secondary diagnosis of a chronic pain condition. OUD and OD were captured from inpatient or outpatient encounters with a diagnosis code for opioid misuse, dependence, or poisoning [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For each outcome, we included only patients with no prior events during the 6-month baseline and calculated incident rates of residents who experienced new events over person-days of follow-up.</p><p>In MDS 3.0, pain intensity was measured by residents&#8217; recall of the worst pain in the last 5 days based on a 10-point numerical rating scale (higher scores indicating greater pain) or a 4-level categorical verbal descriptor scale (no, mild, moderate, or severe pain) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To facilitate analysis, scores of the two pain scales were combined and classified into four categories: no (0), mild (1&#8211;4), moderate (5&#8211;7), and severe (8&#8211;10) pain [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Physical function was measured by the 9-item (i.e., bed mobility, transfer, walking in room, walking in corridor, locomotion on unit, dressing, eating, toilet use, and personal hygiene) self-care activities of daily living (ADL), with each item scored from 0 (total independence) to 4 (total dependence) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The total ADL score ranged from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating worse physical function; a cut-off &#8805;19 was used to define moderate-to-severe physical function. Depression status was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with each of the 9 items scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score ranged from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating worse depression; a cut-off &#8805;10 was used to define moderate-to-severe depression [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>To analyze associations with clinical outcomes mostly obtained from quarterly MDS 3.0 data, we divided patients&#8217; follow-up into quarterly intervals. In each patient quarter, we calculated individual changes in outcomes by subtracting each patient&#8217;s pain, ADL, and PHQ-9 scores from the corresponding baseline outcome extracted from the baseline MDS assessment. The continuous score changes of these symptoms included scores &gt;0 (worsening),&#8201;&lt;0 (improving), and 0 (no change). Patients with no change in symptoms include two clinically different patient subgroups&#8212;(1) patients who remained no-to-mild from baseline to follow-up, suggesting their symptoms were controlled; and (2) patients who remained moderate-to-severe from baseline to follow-up, suggesting their symptoms were uncontrolled or got worse.

Potential differences in baseline variables between groups were then adjusted via the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), calculated as the inverse of the propensity score for the study group and the inverse of 1 minus the propensity score for the comparison group.

Each IPTW value was truncated at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the influence of outliers on estimates.

Second, to understand whether associations varied by antidepressant classes according to whether they had additional analgesic effects (i.e., serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) or not (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants), we stratified analysis for these two groups. Third, to understand whether associations varied by CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, we stratified by specific opioid drugs. Fourth, to minimize potential competing effects arising from the use of other CYP2D6 inhibitors, we restricted the analysis to patients without use of other CYP2D6-inhibiting medications at baseline.

We found that residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while receiving CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus residents receiving CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants had a higher risk of worsening pain and higher incidence rates of pain-related hospitalizations and pain-related ED visits, with no difference in physical function, depression, OUD, and OD. Consistent findings were observed in sensitivity and multiple subgroup analyses. We observed small magnitude of RR (4%) and RD (1.1%) for worsening pain and moderate magnitude for pain-related hospitalizations (RR&#8201;=&#8201;13%; RD&#8201;=&#8201;1.21 per 1,000 patient-years) and ED visits (RR&#8201;=&#8201;17%; RD&#8201;=&#8201;0.85 per 1,000 patient-years). These findings suggest that initiating CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing antidepressants that strongly or moderately inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme was associated with worsening pain control and increased risk for pain-related medical encounters, although their RRs and RDs appear to be small to moderate during the follow-up period (up to 1 year) among older nursing home residents.</p><p>To our best knowledge, only one prior population-based study focused on older nursing home residents and examined the safety of opioid-antidepressant interaction triggered by initiation of antidepressants (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction) [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consistent with the prior study, the present study that examined the interaction triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction) observed increased risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalizations, and pain-related ED visits for residents with CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly used with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. The finding for worsening pain echoes the results of other prior studies conducted in patients with depression or surgery in a single clinical setting [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and results of clinical trials [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While the direction of associations for these adverse outcomes is similar, the magnitude of these associations appears to differ, with smaller relative and absolute effects on worsening pain (RR&#8201;=&#8201;1.04 versus 1.13; RD&#8201;=&#8201;1.1% versus 3.9%), pain-related hospitalization (IRR&#8201;=&#8201;1.13 versus 1.37; RD&#8201;=&#8201;1.12 versus 3.96 per 1,000 patient-years), and pain-related ED visit (IRR&#8201;=&#8201;1.17 versus 1.49; RD&#8201;=&#8201;0.85 versus 3.02 per 1,000 patient-years) associated with the opioid-triggered interactions versus antidepressant-triggered interactions [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The difference in association magnitude supports our hypothesis that the degree of impact on adverse outcomes associated with opioid-antidepressant interactions varies by the sequence of drug initiation.</p><p>The present study, however, did not observe significant associations for OUD, in contrast to the prior study that investigated opioid-antidepressant interaction triggered by initiation of antidepressants among older nursing home residents [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The disparate finding between the prior and present study is likely explained by the difference in the sequence of opioid or antidepressant use. The prior study focused on existing users of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids who likely developed opioid dependence at baseline. Initiating CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants on existing CYP2D6-metabolized opioids decreased opioid analgesic effect, leading to increasing use of opioids to relieve pain or inability to reduce opioid use, symptoms considered for the diagnosis of OUD [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Conversely, the present study focused on existing users of antidepressants who had not yet received opioids at baseline. Given that this group of patients was at no risk for opioid dependence, initiating CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing antidepressants, although decreasing opioid analgesic effect, had no association with OUD. Consistent with the prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the present study found no association with physical function, depressive symptoms, and OD among older nursing home adults, suggesting that these patient outcomes may not be immediately affected by concomitant antidepressant-opioid use regardless of the sequence of drug initiation. No difference in OD was observed between the study and comparison group, which is consistent with preclinical [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and pharmacokinetic modeling studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggesting that use of CYP2D6 inhibitors alone with oxycodone is not associated with increased oxycodone and oxymorphone concentration, a major underlying cause of OD.</p><p>The present study provides referential data for clinicians regarding the safety of initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction), which was predominantly used by older nursing home residents for treating their comorbid depression and chronic pain. Among patients whose opioid-antidepressant interaction was triggered by the opioids, use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids concomitantly with CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYPD2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with an increased risk of worsening pain and risk of pain-related hospitalizations and ED visits. However, the relative and absolute risks of these outcomes associated with opioid-triggered interactions appear to be low to moderate, compared to the estimates associated with antidepressant-triggered interactions [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overall, our study along with the prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggests that when co-use of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids and antidepressants is clinically needed, selection of CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants, rather than CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants, may reduce the risk of worsening pain and pain-related hospital and ED visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has limitations. First, Medicare prescription drug event data provide information on prescription drugs dispensed but not consumed and do not capture self-paid prescriptions or medications covered by non-Medicare programs. For example, 6% of Medicare beneficiaries were veterans in 2022 [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and may obtain their prescriptions through veterans&#8217; insurance program [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Second, Medicare data do not provide genetic information about individuals&#8217; capacity for metabolizing opioids and antidepressants, which may affect adverse outcomes. Lack of individual genetic information also prevents us from examining the heterogeneity of effects on adverse outcomes associated with opioid-antidepressant interactions across subgroups by CYP2D6 genotypes. Nevertheless, the present study provides average effects in the older nursing home population who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while receiving antidepressants. Third, Medicare Part D data provided no information on disease indications for which a drug is prescribed. To address this issue, we required eligible residents to have a diagnosis of chronic pain (for opioid initiation) and a diagnosis of indications FDA-approved or off-label use (for antidepressant treatment) during the baseline period to minimize potential confounding by indication. Fourth, because we relied on resident reports for clinical outcomes and administrative claims data for pain-related hospitalizations and ED visits, measurement bias was possible, although such bias is likely nondifferential between the study and comparison groups. Fifth, the underdiagnosis of OUD was possible, but this too is likely nondifferential between groups. Sixth, while we accounted for many potential confounders, our results remain subject to unknown or unmeasured confounding. Seventh, we used intention-to-treat analysis without censoring patients when they stopped CYP2D6-metabolized opioids or antidepressants or when they switched from CYP2D6-inhibiting to CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants (or vice versa) during the follow-up, which may yield conservative effect estimates, compared to per protocol analysis. Finally, our results can be generalized only to older nursing home long-term residents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cohort study of older nursing home residents who received antidepressants, concomitant use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP-neutral) antidepressants with newly-prescribed CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with increased risk of worsening pain and hospital and ED visits due to pain, although the relative and absolute risks of these outcomes are small to moderate. No association was found for physical function, depressive symptoms, OUD, and OD. The findings, consistent with a prior study [<xref rid="pmed.1004620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggested that clinicians should be aware of potential worsening pain and hospital and ED visits due to pain among patients who concomitantly used CYP2D6-metabolizing opioids and antidepressants, particularly those with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants. Caution is needed in interpreting our finding given the limitations of the data and nature of the observational study, which is subject to unmeasured confounding.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"

This extended earlier research that found in a similar patient population who were already taking CYP2D6-metabolised opioids, initiating CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants was associated with adverse outcomes including increased pain. The study design was a retrospective cohort study utilising USA Medicare nursing home data and controlled for potential baseline imbalance with inverse probability of treatment weighting.</p><p>The manuscript is clear and well written. The authors effectively establish the importance of this research, situate it with respect to the existing literature, and define the characteristics of the cohort and data sources well. I also commend their proactive use of the STROBE checklist. While I suspect their analytical approach is broadly sound, I have some concerns and further detail is needed, so this is the focus of my feedback. Also, while the Discussion is very well constructed and argued, the authors don't appear to consider clinical significance (in addition to statistical significance), which is especially important when analysing large volumes of data. </p><p>Detailed feedback on the manuscript is provided below. My primary focus has been methodological, but I have made a few broader points as well. All items are major unless indicated otherwise.</p><p>1. [MINOR] I understand there is a lot to squeeze into the abstract but the fact all analyses are based on IPTW is important to know. I'd encourage the authors to find some way to identify this in either the abstract or, alternatively, the title. </p><p>2. What is the difference between a "nursing home" and a "skilled nursing facility" and what was the reasoning behind omitting patients with a stay at the latter? This excluded a substantial number of patients, and the reasoning isn't immediately clear to non-US readers. Did you consider sensitivity analyses including these patient (or separate analyses exclusively on these patients)?</p><p>3. Also with respect to inclusion/exclusion, Fig 1 says ~70k patients were excluded because they did not have a "&#8230; diagnosis of chronic pain for CYP2D6-metabolised opioids during 1 month before cohort entry", but I did not see this in the methods. Suggest making this clearer in the body of the manuscript given the large number of excluded patients. </p><p>4. "Residents were followed up from cohort entry until the end of 1-year follow-up, Medicare disenrollment, death, NH discharge, or study end (December 31, 2021)." Two things. Firstly, suggest the distribution of these outcomes is reported. Secondly, why did the authors enrol patients in 2021 with the knowledge they would not have a full year of follow-up? That is, why not cease enrolling new participants at the end of 2020 to ensure all enrolled patients could have had a full year of follow-up? One risk here is the influence of unobserved confounders that vary over time. </p><p>5. "Residents were allowed to re-enter the cohort after the end of follow-up if they met the eligibility criteria." How did the authors account for this non-independence in their statistical analyses? </p><p>6. Relatedly, I note that the authors incorporated some site-level covariates, but I don't think the site/patient/observation hierarchy was incorporated into the statistical modelling. Please clarify and consider the risk of site-level variation not adequately captured in the included site-level covariates. </p><p>7. Please describe how the propensity score was calculated and include an appropriate reference. </p><p>8. Please justify your choice of IPTW over other propensity score-based methods (such as propensity score matching) and include an appropriate reference. Note I am not suggesting the authors shouldn't have used IPTW, rather it is one option of several with different pros and cons so understanding the reasoning is important. </p><p>9. "For each clinical outcome, we used a modified Poisson regression&#8230;" How was it modified and why? I suspect you mean robust Poisson regression was used but this needs clarification and an appropriate reference. </p><p>10. "For ORAE count outcomes, we used a Poisson or negative binomial model&#8230;" How was this decision made? I suspect based on the presence of overdispersion but important to make clear. </p><p>11. I don't understand why reference [20] was included. The cited literature examined zero-inflated mixture models which are not employed here. </p><p>12. Similarly, I don't understand why reference [21] was included. The cited literature examined IPCW but as a win ratio statistic which is not used here. Further clarity here is important - what problem are you trying to solve and why is your choice of approach the optimal solution? </p><p>13. I am concerned the clinical significance of the outcomes is not sufficiently considered (separately to the statistical significance), which is a risk with large sample sizes like in this research. For example, the primary result "the study vs. comparison group had higher risk of worsening pain (aRR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.06]; P &lt; .001)&#8230;" is undoubtedly statistically significant but is a 4% difference between groups of clinical importance? Also, when comparing this study and the authors' earlier study it is suggested "&#8230;the magnitude of these associations differs, with a smaller effect on worsening pain (RR=1.04 vs 1.03)&#8230;"; here I would question a 4% worsening of pain is "different in magnitude" to a 3% worsening of pain. Suggest discussing clinical significance ideally referencing reasonable minimum differences established clinically, and perhaps moderating language in some cases. </p><p>14. [MINOR] "Our observed null association with OD is also supported by pharmacokinetic&#8230;" Be careful with wording here - absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. </p><p>15. [MINOR] Considered together, the main publication and supplementary materials report a very large number of p-values with the attendant risk of Type I error(s). I appreciate they are included for completeness however I would encourage consideration of omitting some - particularly in the supplementary materials, noting 95% CIs suffice in many cases. </p><p>16. Given the complexity of the data management and statistical analyses, I would strongly encourage the authors to include their code to facilitate understanding and replicability. At a minimum this would include their statistical modelling code and, ideally, code developed to produce variables of interest including outcomes, exposures, and other covariates. </p><p>Reviewer #2: This large cohort study utilized nationwide Medicare data from the USA to compare clinical outcomes among older nursing home residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already using CYP2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants between 2010 and 2021. The authors followed individuals for one year and analyzed three distinct outcome groups: pain intensity, physical functioning, and depression. After adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders and covariates using inverse probability of treatment weighting, the study found that users of CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants were associated with worsened pain-related outcomes, including increased rates of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. However, no significant differences were observed between the groups in physical functioning or depressive symptoms.</p><p>This study is well-designed and structured, leveraging exceptionally large-scale data to address an important research question about the vulnerable older population. The authors effectively controlled for confounding variables using robust statistical methods and conducted a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The manuscript is well-written, with a balanced presentation of the relevant literature. Moreover, the conclusions are well-supported by the data and results. However, the current reviewer has outlined the following queries, requests for clarification, and suggested revisions to further enhance the manuscript's quality:</p><p>1. Introduction: While the authors discuss the potential mechanisms underlying interactions between these drug groups and their impact on outcomes to some extent, further elaboration on these mechanisms would strengthen the study's background and justification. This would help establish clearer hypotheses for the three outcomes: worsening depressive symptoms, impaired physical functioning, and increased pain intensity.</p><p>2. Methods - Covariates: Why was the calendar year not included as a covariate? Prescribing patterns for opioids and antidepressants, as well as clinical guidelines and care facility utilization, likely changed over time and could influence the outcomes.</p><p>3. Sensitivity Analyses: It would be valuable to perform an additional analysis restricting antidepressant users to those with a treatment indication of depression. Since antidepressants in older adults may also be prescribed for non-depressive indications (e.g., pain), excluding individuals with such indications could help clarify and rule out the possibility that worsening pain intensity was due to selection bias&#8212;specifically, the inclusion of individuals already using antidepressants for pain who may have experienced greater worsening in pain intensity.</p><p>4. If data on treatment indications for antidepressants and opioids are unavailable, this limitation should be acknowledged, as confounding by indication is a significant concern in observational research.</p><p>5. Sensitivity Analyses - Clarification: The sensitivity analyses section would benefit from further explanation of the purpose of each sensitivity analysis and what potential biases or issues they aim to address. This may not be immediately clear to all readers.</p><p>6. Discussion: In the first paragraph of the discussion section, the authors state that "CYP2D6 enzyme led to worsening pain control." The phrase "led to" implies causality, which is inappropriate in this context. The statement should be revised to avoid suggesting causation.</p><p>7. Public Health Impact: To enhance the discussion of public health implications, the authors could calculate an attributable fraction for the population. This would estimate how many excess cases of hospitalizations or ED visits could be prevented by prescribing CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants alongside CYP2D6-metabolized opioids.</p><p>8. Limitations: Regarding the first limitation, how large is the group of individuals whose prescriptions were self-paid or covered by non-Medicare programs? Including this information would provide additional context.</p><p>9. Prescriber Information: Is there any data on prescriber qualifications (e.g., general practitioners, psychiatrists, or other specialists)? If prescriber characteristics might influence drug selection and treatment outcomes, this limitation should be discussed.</p><p>10. Tables: The presentation of findings in Tables 2 and 3 could be improved by using forest plots, which would make the results more visually engaging and easier to interpret compared to the current monotone tabular format.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Thank you so much for the opportunity to review this interesting study. </p><p>Overall, I think the research question is articulated clearly. The prose is concise and well written. However I don't believe the results are robust or are meaningful enough to have clinical relevance. I have a number of serious concerns surrounding the study. </p><p>1) First, I am concerned that the CYP2D6 inhibiting antidepressants were not classified appropriately. For example, some of the medications listed in the CYP2D6 neutral group actually have CYP2D6 inhibiting properties, albeit weaker than paxil and prozac (i.e., sertraline, desvenlafaxine, citalopram). If duloxetine (a mild to moderate 2D6 inhibitor) was grouped with paxil and prozac, shouldn't you group other mild or moderate 2D6 inhibitors?</p><p>2) There is no doubt that 2D6 metabolism is impacted by various antidepressants. Whether this is a clinically meaningful impact is a whole different story. In short, I am not convinced the authors established the theoretical foundation for focusing on 2D6</p><p>Some recent studies have suggested that 2D6 inhibition itself is inadequate to meaningfully interfere with oxycodone metabolism. See PMID 20857093 for more details: "paroxetine pretreatment inhibits cyp2d6 without inducing relevant changes in oxycodone exposure and partially blunts the pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone due to intrinsic pharmacological activities." Also see PMID 21142269 "the effect of paroxetine on plasma concentrations of oxycodone was negligible." </p><p>Overall, I am not convinced that the association observed here is even driven by CYP2D6 effects. Namely, several of the antidepressants in the 2D6 group are well known to be anticholinergic and even land on the Beers list of geriatric medications. How do we know it's the 2D6 that's the underlying cause? </p><p>3) In clinical practice, cymbalta and paxil also tend not to be 1st line meds for bread and butter depression. This raises questions about unmeasured confounding. Could it just be that the people receiving paxil and cymbalta are sicker at baseline -- and have more comorbidities -- than the other group, contributing to the observed association? </p><p>I appreciate the use of IPTWs w/ Standard diffs showing good balance between the groups. However, I am still concerned about residual confounding (i.e., there was no adjustment for the amount of time people were on opioids, the dosage of opioids, the type of opioids, etc.) This could very well confound the observed association. The fact that the study group had 61.6% using an adjuvant analgesic vs 37% in the control group also makes me wonder if the study group just had more baseline pain levels and would have had higher pain related healthcare encounters no matter what antidepressant. </p><p>4) The results don't appear very robust or clinically meaningful enough to justify the authors' conclusions: For example, an 15% vs 11% difference in pain related hospitalization, with a confidence interval of 1.04-1.21, is a very small difference. Should a clinician switch someone who has been stable on prozac to something else when the difference is merely 15% vs 11% (w/ a 95%CI abutting 1.00)? Several of the secondary analyses seemed to have no association between 2D6 inhibitors vs 2D6 neutral meds and the outcome variables of interest. </p><p>Minor</p><p>5) I'm a little confused why you required residents to have coma or severe cognitive impairment - this could confound the pain assessment and the reasons for hospitalizations. Pain assessment would have much higher variability for a person with cognitive impairment. If it's being assessed by different providers, there would also be more operator variability. This can greatly skew your results. </p><p>6) Pain related hospitalization and ED visits were defined as encounters with a primary or secondary diagnosis of a chronic pain condition: there is a lot of room for error here. Lots of chronic pain is coded as a hospital problem, even if the plan is to just continue home medications. It does not necessarily mean that the healthcare encounter was at all a result of the pain. There's no way to know that the pain was current and pertinent to the admission or ED visit. </p><p>7) On page 9, you say we classified residents with score changes equal to 0 that remained moderate to severe as having worsening outcomes. Similarly, you classified residents with score change of 0 that had no-to-mild pain as improving outcome. Those two scenarios are by definition the same outcome, not worsening or improving outcomes? </p><p>8) On page 6, you say among older NH patients who concomitantly use both CYP2D6-metabolized opioids and antidepressants, 80% are those who received antidepressants first followed by opioids. What is the source of this statistic? </p><p>Reviewer #4: The authors provide a very well written manuscript investigating the addition of opioids to a treatment regimen of antidepressants and its consequences. The outcomes are informative and appropriately chosen for purpose in clinical practice, which is a particular strength of the research. </p><p>I have only a few questions or suggestions:</p><p>1. The methods are generally well chosen considering interdependency of individuals included several times and repeated outcome measurements and covariate balance and adjustment. However, re-entering of previous users may dilute the effect due to depletion of susceptibles, even though the influence of drug-drug interactions may be virgin. However due to the complexity of IA depletion of susceptibles may still be relevant? Please comment on this potential bias.</p><p>2. According to the authors one day of overlap was sufficient to qualify for concurrent use. The authors allowed gaps of less than 15 days between precriptions. Please detail how episodes of concurrent exposure were constructed and how this may effect the risk estimates during the one year of follow-up. This is imprtnat to be reported to enable reproduceability of results. </p><p>3. Would any information of dosage of drugs be availbale for the analysis and how could this consideration have affected the findings?</p><p>4. The authors consider concomitant use of other CYP inhibitors and inducers at baseline and by exclusion in sensitivity analyses. a) For reproducabiliyty reasons, I could not find any information of how these were identified and which drugs fell into which category. b) Moreover, it would have been interesting to explore the association between the burden of inhibitors and inducers on the outcomes during follow-up in a time varying manner, but also depending on how concurrent use episodes of the opioid drugs of interest were constructed. It is not clear why the other drugs metabolized by CYP would have more or less impact than the antidepressants under investigation, in particular if used in a regular manner. Please comment on that. </p><p>5. Communication of absolute risk differences and number needed to harm could be clincally relevant putting the reported 4% higher risk of </p><p>worsening pain and 13% and 17% higher incidence rates of pain-related hospitalizations and pain-related ED visits into perspective.</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link: [LINK]</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------- ---</p><p>General editorial requests:</p><p>(Note: not all will apply to your paper, but please check each item carefully)</p><p>* We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement, making sure to declare all competing interests.

I am satisfied the authors have addressed all my concerns and I am happy to recommend acceptance. </p><p>I also wanted to include a few additional thoughts for the authors' future consideration. I don't think these are necessary for this particular paper because, fortuitously, there were small numbers of patients re-entering the cohort and limited clustering effects. That said, it would be remiss of me to not to be clear on these points for future cases when there is a pronounced lack of independence within the data. </p><p>For items 5 and 6 the authors made use of PROC GLIMMIX to fit models accounting for non-independence within the data. The authors then experienced issues with convergence - a problem I have regularly encountered when fitting GLMMs to large datasets. I draw the authors' attention to a SAS paper I have found useful ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings18/2179-2018.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings18/2179-2018.pdf</ext-link> ) and a section of the SAS documentation that is important and not at all easy to find ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/15.2/statug_introcom_sect054.htm" ext-link-type="uri">https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/15.2/statug_introcom_sect054.htm</ext-link> ). I hope the authors find these resources helpful when experiencing convergence issues in the future. The authors could also have considered using a GEE-type model ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.3/statug/statug_genmod_examples05.htm" ext-link-type="uri">https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.3/statug/statug_genmod_examples05.htm</ext-link> ) as the estimates of interest are population-level, and GEEs tend to fit much easier than mixed models. As I said above, in this particular paper I am satisfied that approaches taken are sufficient and appropriate. However, this would not always be the case, so I wanted to ensure I provided some useful resources for future work. </p><p>I also wanted to note that the authors were quite right in their response to item 15, and I thank them for drawing this to my attention. I agree the authors are compliant with the current editorial guidelines, and I have raised my thoughts on this with the editorial team. </p><p>Thanks for the opportunity to review and congratulations on an excellent paper. </p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>Thank you for your thorough responses and the revisions made to the manuscript. I appreciate your efforts to address my concerns, particularly regarding the inclusion of adjusted absolute risks and risk differences, as well as the clarification on the limitations of the data.</p><p>While I still have some residual concerns regarding potential confounding by indication and the lack of study-specific data for certain limitations, I recognize that you have made a genuine effort to address these points. I acknowledge the inherent limitations of observational studies and believe that the remaining aspects are unlikely to significantly alter the overall findings.</p><p>Therefore, I strongly recommend that you:</p><p>Emphasize the need for caution when interpreting the results in light of the potential confounding by indication, particularly by adding a statement to the conclusion section that acknowledges this potential bias.</p><p>I believe that a thorough and transparent discussion of these limitations is crucial for the accurate interpretation of your findings. I recommend acceptance of the manuscript, with these minor revisions.</p><p>Reviewer #3: </p><p>The authors have appropriately acknowledged the limitations of their work and were responsive to my comments. The remaining thing I struggle with is how physicians who prescribe opioids and antidepressants should interpret this data. At present, discussion of clinical implications is largely absent. </p><p>My main question is: Do these results suggest that the opioid + CYP2D6 inhibitor combination is potentially harmful in a clinically meaningful way in older adults in nursing homes? Should clinicians reading this paper consider avoiding such co-prescriptions? </p><p>The risks of any medication (i.e., opioids and antidepressants in this case) must be weighed against their potential benefits and alternatives. The effect sizes for many of the risks of opioid and CYP2D6 inhibitor co-prescribing were very small (i.e., RR of 1.04 for pain-related outcomes), and data on potential benefits of co-prescribing was outside the scope of the paper (and thus absent). </p><p>If an older adult in a nursing home presents with opioids co-prescribed with CYP2D6 inhibiting antidepressants, I think it would be a stretch to suggest that the data here lend strong support for trying to get patients off the co-prescription. </p><p>In conclusion, the data may be statistically significant, but not convincingly clinically significant. </p><p>Reviewer #4: </p><p>Thank you for answering my comments and providing additional detailed information on the methods, adjusted risk differences and attenuating the interpretation of the findings increasing the credibility of these kind of studies linking clinical pharmacology with population-based perspectives.</p><p>Any attachments provided with reviews can be seen via the following link:</p><p>[LINK]</p><supplementary-material id="pmed.1004620.s015" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Reviewers comments 2nd round.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pmed.1004620.s015.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pmed.1004620.r007"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1004620.r007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pmed.1004620" id="rel-obj007" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
