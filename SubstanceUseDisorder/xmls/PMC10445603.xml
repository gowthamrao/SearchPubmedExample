Social and economic conditions brought on during the COVID-19 pandemic have in some cases exacerbated housing issues that preceded the pandemic and have made housing less accessible and more expensive for many low-income households. Access to safe and affordable housing functions as a social determinant of health,<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> making it important to examine populations experiencing homelessness from a public health lens. Conditions of homelessness can put people at greater risk for early mortality as well as for contracting infectious and chronic diseases.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Per federal requirements, at a minimum, publicly funded substance use disorder and mental health treatment services in the United States must collect admissions and discharge data from the clients they serve. In Delaware, this data is collected using the Consumer Reporting Form (CRF) and reported by providers to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH). This state-level data is then reported and compiled as Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&#8217;s (SAMHSA) Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS).</p><p>While there has been no recent publication of Delaware-specific data regarding clients in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment who have been or are currently homeless, there has been research using national TEDS data or data specific to other states. One study of treatment data in California found that people experiencing homelessness, when compared to clients with stable housing, have lower rates of retention and successful discharge, a greater prevalence of mental health diagnoses and unemployment, and were more likely to receive residential treatment.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Another study, focused on national data, reported that while 12.5% of clients admitted for opioid use disorder treatment were experiencing homelessness, those who reported experiencing homelessness were less likely to receive medication-assisted treatment than clients in stable housing; those clients experiencing homelessness were also more likely to be male and admitted to a residential program.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Because of the often-hidden nature of homelessness, it can be difficult to get a true measure of its prevalence across a population; as a result, groups experiencing homelessness are often understudied. The Delaware Continuum of Care (COC) is a collaborative and community-based body committed to addressing homelessness in Delaware with the goal of securing housing for all. The COC conducts a point in time (PIT) count one night a year to assess the scope of the problem of homelessness in the state. In 2022, the PIT count reported 2,369 people experiencing homelessness in Delaware, which is double the number of people experiencing homelessness measured by the 2020 PIT count just prior to the onset of the pandemic.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In particular, they found sharpest increases in homelessness among families with children, veterans, and Black or African American people.</p><p>While evidence suggests that people experiencing homelessness often have acute healthcare needs,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> there has been no recent publicized data on the prevalence of homelessness among clients receiving mental health and substance use treatment in Delaware. In this brief report, authors seek to fill this gap by using data from the CRF to analyze the prevalence of homelessness among people receiving publicly funded treatment in Delaware and key demographic characteristics of this priority population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed CRF data for clients admitted to publicly funded substance use and mental health treatment services in Delaware in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Clients are asked about the following: treatment and diagnosis (reported by clinician); substance use; medical status; employment; income; legal status; family; housing; and mental health. CRFs are completed at admission, discharge, and annually if the client remains in treatment longer than a year. The client&#8217;s provider interviews each client using the form, and all questions are self-reported by the client to the provider aside from diagnoses and treatment services provided which are filled out solely by the provider. All clients who were admitted to services from a publicly funded provider and completed the CRF between 2019 and 2021 were included in this analysis (n=29,495). As a part of the CRF, clients are asked for their current residential arrangement, which includes the option &#8220;None/Homeless,&#8221; as well as whether they have been homeless in the past 30 days. There is no operational definition of homeless on the CRF; as such a client&#8217;s status as homeless is determined by their own interpretation. Clients who reported past 30-day homelessness or &#8220;None/Homeless&#8221; at admission were included in the experiencing homelessness group for this analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between 2019 and 2021, 29,495 unique clients were admitted to publicly funded services.

There is no official population level estimate for homelessness in among Delawareans during this time period. The closest approximation comes from the annual PIT count, which estimates homelessness from a single night. The 2019, 2020, and 2021 PIT counts in Delaware suggested that on a given night, between 921 and 1,579 people were currently experiencing homelessness, which represents less than 1% of the population of Delaware. While point-in-time counts from a single night are not directly comparable to a measure of homelessness over the past 30 days, these data do suggest that people experiencing homelessness may be overrepresented among DSAMH clients receiving SUD and mental health services.</p><p>When comparing treatment modalities, homelessness was more prevalent among clients admitted to substance use treatment as opposed to mental health treatment. People experiencing homelessness and people with substance use disorders are both highly stigmatized groups; when studying the intersections of these populations it is important to acknowledge that people experiencing homelessness are not typically homeless solely because of their substance use. Because of these dual stigmas associated with homelessness and substance use disorders, people experiencing homelessness who also struggle with substance use face additional barriers in accessing evidence-based health care.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This underscores the importance of examining the demographic characteristics of this population in DSAMH services and that are more likely to serve people experiencing homelessness. Withdrawal management and short-term residential care were both identified in this data as modalities that serve a higher proportion of homeless or housing insecure clients.</p><p>There was also a substantial difference in employment status among clients who reported homelessness compared to clients who were stably housed, with approximately half of homeless or housing insecure clients reporting unemployment. This suggests a strong need for workforce development programming for these clients, as well as investment in job opportunities paying a living wage.</p><p>The overall rate of homelessness among the DSAMH treatment population varied over the course of the years of available data. The rate increased from 2019 to 2020, but then decreased in 2021. While extant data sources suggest an increase in the prevalence of homelessness and housing insecurity over this time period of time in Delaware<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> these trends are not clearly reflected in our data. Given facility closures and gaps in CRF administration, it is still difficult to fully account for the impact that the pandemic may have had on both patterns in treatment enrollment and in data collection protocols across locations. In the final section of this paper we outline general public health implications for studying this population and possible future research agendas to continue the work that started here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other1"><title>Public Health Implications</title><p>Homelessness and behavioral health conditions are public health priorities that intersect when individuals need, seek, access, receive, and maintain treatment engagement. Homelessness can be experienced across the lifespan and impacts individuals and families of all demographic makeups. Though, as shown in this analysis, some are disproportionately impacted. As the rate of experiencing homelessness among DSAMH clients is higher than that of the general population, providers should consider these patterns when assessing the service needs of new clients. Further, individuals experiencing homelessness are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from a number of causes, especially overdose.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The reality of homelessness means that individuals are often unable to access and maintain care through primary care providers, insurance-supported services, and chronic disease management teams resulting in disproportionately high use of emergency services and departments for acute needs, including overdose and poisonings.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> As such, substance use and mental health treatment services for individuals experiencing homelessness is a public health opportunity and responsibility. In this context, the overall rate of clients experiencing homelessness found here demonstrates that, at a minimum, clients who are experiencing homelessness are successfully connecting with services. It is vital that as a part of a client&#8217;s substance use or mental health treatment, they also receive support and connection to services related to their overall wellbeing; this includes connection to housing-related services for clients who need them.</p><p>As this paper is exploratory in nature and presents just a beginning to understanding this data, it is beyond our scope at this time to definitively make claims about the precise ways the pandemic may have influenced the population experiencing homelessness and receiving treatment services; while our analysis focuses on that time period, further contextualization is needed around Federal, State, community and provider level efforts related to homelessness that may have affected service access. Future research aimed at advancing the wellbeing of clients experiencing homelessness may examine admission and discharge trends in 2020 and beyond as more data is collected, paying close attention to differences in the type of treatment accessed and how that aligns with client needs. While this paper only looked at admissions over three years in aggregate, future research should also seek to examine client-level characteristics over time. It will also be important to identify associations between demographic categories, such as race and gender, and treatment services in the client population experiencing homelessness. The brief report focused only on introducing these categories with the purpose of establishing baseline prevalence rates, but an extended analysis should examine more precise interactions between these terms. Given the demonstrated prevalence of homelessness in the client population served by DSAMH treatment, it is worthwhile to continue to consider the ways that these treatment services can be better tailored to meet the needs of clients experiencing homelessness to improve both the quality of treatment they receive and their health outcomes post-treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding for this project has been provided by the Delaware Department for Health and Social Services, Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Copyright (c) 2023 Delaware Academy of Medicine / Delaware Public Health Association. </p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" ext-link-type="uri">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/</ext-link>) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Swope</surname>, <given-names>C.
