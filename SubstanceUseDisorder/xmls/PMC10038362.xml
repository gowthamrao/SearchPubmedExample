Responses about comfort in using video visits for different types of OUD patients remained similar over time despite clinicians having substantially more experience with telemedicine by spring 2022 (e.g., 35.8% vs. 36.0% report being comfortable using video visits for new patients). Almost three-quarters (70.9%) reported that most of their patients preferred to have the majority of their visits via telemedicine, and 76.7% agreed that the option to do video visits helped their patients remain in treatment longer.

This includes the relaxation of the Ryan-Haight Act&#8217;s requirement of an in-person visit before initiating a patient on a controlled substance like buprenorphine, a primary evidence-based treatment for OUD.</p><p id="Par9">As the pandemic progressed, telemedicine use across the U.S. health care system steadily declined, and many providers shifted all or most of their outpatient visits back to in-person settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> A number of potential factors may explain the decline of telemedicine visits from their peak in April 2020. First, many clinicians and patients may not perceive telemedicine to be appropriate for many conditions and patient populations, and may have only turned to telehealth out of necessity at the beginning of the pandemic when in-person visits were not an option. Furthermore, there may be a strong status quo bias across the healthcare system, with multiple forces (e.g., policy, cultural) encouraging a return to pre-pandemic delivery patterns when in-person visits became more viable. However, while telemedicine retreated in most medical specialties, high utilization continued for behavioral health services including OUD treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="Par10">To understand why telehealth has continued to play a prominent role in the treatment of OUD several years into the pandemic and explore how views and preferences of OUD clinicians may have shifted over time, we analyzed data from a longitudinal, two-wave survey of clinicians who treat people with OUD. An understanding of clinician experiences and views about telemedicine for OUD care is critical for policymakers considering whether to make permanent some or all of the regulatory and reimbursement changes made during the pandemic, and as they continue to try to address the opioid epidemic.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>METHODS</title><p id="Par11">In late 2020, we recruited a national sample of 602 clinicians who provide OUD medication treatment to participate in a longitudinal survey. As described previously, participants were recruited from WebMD/Medscape&#8217;s online panel of approximately 2.5 million clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> The panel includes clinicians who have joined the WebMD/Medscape platform to access clinical content, tools, and continuing medical education activities. The platform has been commonly used to recruit clinicians in many federal studies including projects sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> To recruit survey participants, WebMD/Medscape emailed all psychiatrists in their online panel and a random sample of primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Clinicians who expressed interest were then screened for eligibility via an online instrument. Criteria for participation were the following: held a current buprenorphine waiver, spent at least 8&#160;h a week practicing in an outpatient setting, prescribed OUD medications to two or more patients in a typical month, and delivered at least one telemedicine visit to a patient with OUD since March 2020. If eligible, the clinician was invited to complete the survey. Recruitment continued until a target sample size was reached (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;600). A total of 3816 clinicians responded to the eligibility screener, and 602 of them met our study criteria. Because of the opt-in nature of the survey, we were not able to calculate a response rate. However, the survey completion rate (defined as the number who completed the survey divided by all respondents who passed the screening criteria) was 97.3%.</p><p id="Par12">Two survey waves were fielded, the first in December 2020 and the second in March 2022; 425 of the 602 wave 1 respondents participated in the second wave, for a retention rate of 70.6%. Respondents who completed both survey waves are the focus of this longitudinal analysis. Analyses used non-response weights to account for attrition. We chose not to use sampling weights because after completing an environmental scan of government and peer-reviewed literature, we did not identify any data sources on the characteristics of the population that we aimed to represent (i.e., the universe of clinicians currently providing OUD medication treatment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> The survey instrument was informed by qualitative interviews with buprenorphine waivered clinicians in the spring of 2020 and cognitive testing with five clinicians who represented the target population. For cognitive testing, we created a semi-structured interview guide. We first asked participants to explain how they were interpreting each question using the think-aloud procedure. Second, we instructed participants to identify any questions or terms that were confusing, unclear, or cognitively burdensome and whether response options were complete. Following each interview, our study team discussed potential revisions and revised questions for clarity so that the next participant would receive the latest set of (modified) questions. No new changes were introduced after the fourth interview.</p><p id="Par13">In both survey waves, we asked clinicians about the percentage of their visits for patients with OUD that were conducted via telemedicine and their comfort level caring for different types of patients with OUD (i.e., established patients who are clinically stable in their recovery, established patients not clinically stable in their recovery, and new patients) via telemedicine. In wave 2, we added questions including those about clinician preferences related to current and future telemedicine use, their views of patient preferences for telemedicine use, their opinions on the relationship between telemedicine use and retention in treatment, and how telemedicine use had affected their practice. We hypothesized that use would decline but the reported comfort level with telemedicine would increase from wave 1 to wave 2 because clinicians would have had more than a year of additional experience using telemedicine regularly.</p><p id="Par14">Wave 2 also included questions about the impact that using telemedicine has had on the respondent&#8217;s overall work-related well-being in the last month. Those respondents who reported a very or somewhat positive impact were then asked to describe the positive impact in an open-ended question; similarly, those who reported a very or somewhat negative impact were asked to describe it. Using an inductive approach, we coded responses to the open-ended questions on how using telemedicine has positively or negatively impacted work-related well-being into thematic categories (10 in the case of positive impacts and 8 in the case of negative impacts). All responses were double-coded by two members of the study team (LR and LUP), and they met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies by consensus. We excluded 3 (1.0%) responses that were not applicable or interpretable. We then produced descriptive statistics to describe the proportion of responses in each category.</p><p id="Par15">We calculated descriptive statistics for key survey questions and used chi-squared tests to assess whether changes in telemedicine utilization and attitudes about telemedicine over time were significant. We estimated a logistic regression model of the likelihood of reporting a positive impact (as opposed to a negative or no impact) of using telemedicine on work-related well-being, as a function of provider type (PCP, psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner/certified nurse specialist/physician&#8217;s assistant), years since completion of training (9 or fewer, 10&#8211;19, or 20&#8201;+&#8201;years), and primary practice setting (single-specialty group practice, multi-specialty group practice, solo practice, or other setting). Analyses were conducted using Stata version 16.1. Harvard Medical School&#8217;s Institutional Review Board approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="Par16">Characteristics of the 425 clinicians who completed both waves of the survey were very similar to those of clinicians who completed only wave 1 (see Appendix Exhibit <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A.1</xref>).

If generalizable to other OUD clinicians, this raises the question of why telemedicine is perceived to be more advantageous in the treatment of OUD than for many other clinical conditions.</p><p id="Par24">Our findings point to several potential reasons. First, we found that most clinicians who treat OUD in our sample believed that telemedicine helps their patients stay in treatment longer. Also, most reported that their patients with OUD wanted at least some of their care to be delivered via telemedicine.</p><p id="Par25">Interestingly, surveyed clinicians treating OUD do not appear to be using telemedicine for patient-centered reasons only&#8212;importantly, most of those surveyed, particularly those with fewer years since completing their clinical training, reported a positive impact of telemedicine on their work-related well-being. Reasons included increased productivity/efficiency, the ability to offer greater access and convenience to patients, and the ability to spend more time not at work (e.g., with family, not commuting). Given the workforce shortage of clinicians who treat OUD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and reports of increased stress and burnout within the healthcare workforce more broadly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> strategies that can help providers to be more efficient, broaden their geographical reach, and/or have better work-life balance are important for policy makers to consider. Among the 13.5% who reported a negative impact, reasons included concerns about quality/effectiveness of telemedicine (vs. in-person) care and challenges building rapport with patients when using telemedicine, which are issues that have been identified in previous qualitative studies of OUD clinicians&#8217; responses to telemedicine during the pandemic period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> It is possible that our finding that clinicians who completed training more recently were more likely to report a positive impact of telemedicine on work-related well-being may reflect higher levels of digital literacy for this group than for those who have been in practice longer. The difference could also reflect a difference in stage of life&#8212;for example, clinicians who completed training more than 20&#160;years ago may be less likely to have children living in the home (and thus, perhaps, a greater appreciation for flexibility) than those with less time since training completion.</p><p id="Par26">While surveyed clinicians preferred to continue delivering a sizeable share of their OUD visits via telemedicine, they appeared to have strong and relatively stable views of which patients may be most appropriate to receive those visits. For established patients who are clinically stable, the vast majority of clinicians (over 80%) reported being comfortable with video visits. However, the percentages of clinicians who reported being comfortable using video visits for clinically unstable and new patients remained considerably lower than those for stable patients 2&#160;years into the pandemic, after most clinicians and patients have had experience using telemedicine. The relative stability of these reports suggests that, even if the Ryan-Haight Act requirement for telemedicine is permanently waived (i.e., clinicians no longer have to complete an in-person visit before initiating prescribing buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine), use of telemedicine for MOUD initiation may continue to represent a relatively small minority of initiations, even if serving an important role in ensuring access to care for that subset of individuals struggling with OUD. In the longer term, clinician views on telemedicine use for OUD care may shift, perhaps with additional training, other interventions, or additional research on its effectiveness in different subpopulations.</p><p id="Par27">A number of respondents also noted changes in their practice patterns that likely resulted in improved access to care for patients, including that telemedicine use has allowed them to see more patients and resulted in increased access to after-hours care. Given the increased demand for OUD services during the pandemic and ongoing shortage of providers, these changes could increase the supply of OUD care and therefore support greater, and ideally more equitable, access to treatment for individuals with OUD.</p><p id="Par28">Our findings for this sample of clinicians who treat OUD echo some findings of a survey of physicians across clinical specialties conducted in late 2021 by the American Medical Association. More than 80% of their respondents reported that their patients have better access to care since using telemedicine, and 54% reported that telemedicine use has improved their own satisfaction with their work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Our findings are also concordant with those from a survey of physicians with waivers to prescribe buprenorphine that was fielded in July 2020. In that survey, 54% of physicians reported finding telehealth to be more effective than they expected and 85% reported being in favor of permanently extending the temporary pandemic-related telehealth regulatory flexibilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup></p><p id="Par29">An important limitation is that our surveys were administered online to an opt-in (nonprobability-based) sample of clinicians, so the findings may not be representative of all clinicians who treat OUD. To our knowledge, there are no national data on the characteristics of clinicians actively providing OUD medication treatment. While our respondents appear to be generally similar in selected characteristics (i.e., those for which data are available) to prior national surveys of buprenorphine waivered clinicians, our findings may not, in fact, be generalizable to all clinicians who treat individuals with OUD (Exhibit <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A.3</xref> in Appendix).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Second, although all of our questions were developed following a review of existing surveys and pilot tested with waivered clinicians, our questionnaire was not formally validated. Third, this study did not assess issues related to equity for telemedicine use; this is an important area for future study. Fourth, a key outcome was the percentage of visits for OUD delivered via telemedicine, and this was the outcome that was used to determine the sample size for our survey. The comparison of clinician reports of comfort caring for different types of individuals with OUD via telemedicine and the analysis of telemedicine&#8217;s impact on work-related well-being were not specified a priori so should be considered exploratory and subject to further confirmatory work.</p><p id="Par30">Nevertheless, this study&#8212;the first longitudinal study of OUD clinicians&#8217; preferences and views about telemedicine use&#8212;provides important clues about how OUD clinicians may view the role of telehealth going forward. In contrast to some other areas in clinical care, telemedicine may be particularly valuable in the treatment of OUD and other SUDs. This may be because of unique features of these illnesses, such as the high level of stigma and the high prevalence of OUD in underserved communities such as rural areas where provider shortages are particularly acute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Within Medicare, OUD has already been singled out as a condition that is uniquely suited for telemedicine, and there is permanent reimbursement for both video and audio-only telemedicine without geographic or originating site restrictions. While it is not yet clear how state policies will evolve, our research suggests that clinicians may see an important, permanent role for telemedicine in OUD care.
