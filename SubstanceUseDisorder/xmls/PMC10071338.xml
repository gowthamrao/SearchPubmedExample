Approximately two-thirds of women report pain that interferes with activities of daily living at 24 hours post partum, and up to 18% of women experience chronic pain after delivery.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Proper management of postpartum pain is crucial, as evidence shows that untreated pain during the postpartum period increases the risk of postpartum depression and chronic pain.</p><p>Current recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are for clinicians to follow a stepwise approach to pain management for postpartum women, beginning with acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and following with low-potency and then high-potency opioids, as needed.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> One study from prior to the COVID-19 pandemic found that approximately 45.3% of women received a prescription for opioids at delivery discharge.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Rates of prescribing differed substantially based on delivery modality: 30.4% of women who delivered vaginally and 86.7 % of women who delivered via cesarean birth received an opioid prescription.</p><p>Although opioids are very effective for treating pain, the timely receipt of postpartum care is crucial to facilitate appropriate use given their high potential for misuse. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations state that opioid use for treatment of postpartum pain should be for the &#8220;shortest reasonable&#8221; duration.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, evidence shows that the number of opioid doses prescribed at delivery are often more than 37% greater than the amount consumed.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In addition, more than 95% of patients do not properly dispose of the excess doses, increasing the potential for misuse.

Clinformatics is derived from a database of administrative health claims for members of large commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans. These administrative claims are submitted for payment by providers and pharmacies and are verified, adjudicated, adjusted, and deidentified. The database includes approximately 15 million to 20 million annual covered lives, with more than 62 million covered lives over a 12-year period, and is <italic toggle="yes">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic>), compliant. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. The University of Georgia institutional review board approved this study and waived the need for informed consent due to the deidentified nature of the data.</p><p>This retrospective cross-sectional study includes 460&#8201;371 postpartum women and approximately 150&#8201;000 live births per year, representing more than 5% of all US births and 14% of births to privately insured women. We observed no Medicaid-insured women in our data. Sample data are aggregated to the patient-birth level and span from July 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. Inclusion criteria for the sample were (1) patients had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment in their plan, (2) patients in the sample had to have a birth during the observation period, (3) patients with multiple births were excluded (each patient had 1 single live birth), and (4) patients in the sample were at least 18 years of age.</p><p>Births and the delivery modality (ie, vaginal or cesarean) were identified from patient medical services files using <italic toggle="yes">Current Procedural Terminology</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">CPT</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic> codes. Both <italic toggle="yes">CPT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic> codes were present in the data for approximately 75% of patients; the remaining patients had only one type of coding structure available (either <italic toggle="yes">CPT</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic> code, but not both). Delivery modality was identifiable from the data for most women (99.5% of the sample [460&#8201;371 of 462&#8201;653]).</p><p>In addition to detailing services rendered and procedures, the medical files also include the date of service, which we used to identify the date of delivery. Patient race and ethnicity were available for 81.1% of the sample (373&#8201;452 of 460&#8201;371). Among commercial administrative data sets, Optum Clinformatics Data Mart reports race and ethnicity using an unvalidated proprietary algorithm derived using member geographic location and name (email communication; Optum Life Science Department Data; August 13, 2021).</p><p>For each patient, we merged medical services and prescription files using the unique patient identifier. The prescription file contains information on prescriptions filled by the patient, including the drug name, National Drug Code, prescription strength in milligrams, prescription days&#8217; supply, and fill date. These data do not include drugs administered in the hospital (eg, anesthesia or epidural medication during delivery). To standardize prescription strength across opioids, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) datafile, which contains MME conversion factors and US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) drug schedule by National Drug Code.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H2-2-ZOI230219"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>We examined several measures of opioid fills during the postpartum period, defined as the first 6 months after the delivery date. First, for the full sample of women with a single live birth during the observation time frame from July 2018 to December 2020, we used an extensive margin measure of whether the patient filled at least 1 opioid prescription during the postpartum period. Second, we used the following measures to examine the intensity of the opioid prescriptions: total number of filled opioid prescriptions per patient, and, conditional on filling an opioid prescription, the mean number of days supplied and mean strength of the prescriptions per birth. Prescription strength is measured in MMEs per day supplied of the prescription. We also examined whether the patient filled a schedule II opioid prescription or if the patient filled a schedule III or higher prescription. Schedule II drugs are considered by the DEA to have a high potential for abuse; schedule III and higher drugs are considered to have moderate to low potential for abuse and dependence.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Schedule II opioids are also stronger than schedule III or higher opioids in terms of MMEs.<sup><xref rid="zoi230219r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These measures were our outcomes of interest (dependent variables).

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Statistical tests were 2-sided. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to fit the time series for each outcome variable using data from births that occurred during the pre&#8211;COVID-19 period (July 2018 to February 2020). The regression included indicator variables for each calendar month to capture seasonality in outcomes. A monthly linear trend term was included to control for the preexisting downward trend in postpartum opioid fill rates. The time-series models were then used to forecast expected outcomes for births that occurred during the March 2020 to December 2020 period; 95% CIs were estimated as 1.96 times the SE of the forecast, above or below our forecast. Forecasted and actual values were then compared to assess the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with opioid prescription fills among postpartum women.</p><p>All descriptive statistics and ordinary least-squares estimations were estimated for the full sample of women as well as stratified by delivery type (vaginal or cesarean delivery).

The observed increases were larger for women who give birth via cesarean delivery than those delivering vaginally.</p><p>These results showed that after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, more postpartum women were exposed to opioids, they filled more opioid prescriptions, and the strength of those prescriptions was higher. Furthermore, while prescription fills of schedule III or higher opioids continued to decline during this period, fills of schedule II opioids, which are stronger and considered to carry a higher risk of abuse, increased.
