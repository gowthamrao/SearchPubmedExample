Every Manitoba resident has a unique personal health identification number (PHIN), and services are provided through a publicly funded universal healthcare system. All healthcare contacts for outpatient physician visits, hospitalizations, and medication dispensing are connected to the PHIN for each individual. The health administration databases accessed for the study included the population registry (dates of birth, death, and health care coverage; sex; and postal code which provided region of residence), medical services/physician claims, the hospital Discharge Abstract Database and Drug Program Information Network (DPIN). Medical services and hospitalization data have been available since 1984 whereas DPIN data have been available since 1995.</p><p>The University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board and Manitoba&#8217;s Health Information Privacy Committee approved this study (Research Ethics Board number: H2014:201).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Study Populations</title><p>All Manitobans with IBD over the period 1984-2016 were identified by applying a validated case definition that required at least 5 healthcare encounters (hospitalizations or physician visits) for IBD, or at least 3 IBD encounters if registered for less than 2 years,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> based on diagnostic codes for IBD. The index date for each person with IBD was based on the earliest CD or UC claim. CD was identified by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 code 555 or ICD-10 code K51, and UC by ICD-9 code 556 and ICD-10 code K52. We created a matched general population cohort with 5:1 matching to the IBD cohort based on sex, year of birth (&#177;5 years), and forward sortation area (first 3 digits of postal code). The reference cohort excluded individuals with diagnosis codes for IBD, as well as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis because we conducted a series of studies that required a common control group to support comparisons across diseases. The index date for each person in the reference cohort was the index date of their matched case. Working from these prevalent cohorts, we focused on incident IBD cases and the matched reference cohort with an index date of 1997 or later. This allowed for at least a 1-year run-in period as DPIN data were available from 1995. We also excluded individuals in the IBD and persons in the reference cohorts with cancer (based on &#8805;1 ICD-9 140-208 or ICD-10-CA C00-C97 code) or in palliative care (based on hospital ICD-9/ICD-10-CA V66.7/Z51.5) since these could be indications for opioid prescription.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Individuals were censored when they were first diagnosed with cancer or entered palliative care, on death, or on leaving the province.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Psychiatric Comorbidity</title><p>We focused on any mood or anxiety disorder because of the availability of a validated case definition, and because these are the most common psychiatric disorders in the general and IBD populations.

The case definition did not include drug exposures, since some antidepressants are used in the management of chronic pain. The date of the first claim for each condition was designated as the diagnosis date. If there were at least 2 physician claims or 1 hospital claim with a diagnosis code for the mood/anxiety disorder in any subsequent year after meeting the case definition the person was deemed to be an &#8220;active&#8221; psychiatric comorbidity case in that year; for hospital claims, the mood/anxiety disorder had to be the most responsible diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Opioid Use</title><p>Opiates are chemical compounds extracted or refined from natural plant matter (ie, morphine or codeine), while opioids are synthesized chemical compounds (ie, hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl).

The 3-month or more time frame to identify chronic use was selected because it has been the most common definition of long-term opioid use in the literature.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In addition to looking at (i) single dispensation, to further examine chronic use, we report the percentage (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) for (ii) continuous use for at least 3 months; (iii) cumulative use for at least 3 months in any 1-year period; (iv) continuous use for at least 6 months; and (v) cumulative use of at least 6 months in a 1-year period. Because of the 5-year period, discontinuation of opioids could be followed by re-initiation of therapy, and the total percentages could exceed 100%.</p><p>Since other medications may also be used for chronic pain management, we report the frequency of use of at least 1 prescription for each of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cannabinoids (A04AD11, A04AD10, N02BG10), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA [N06AA]), and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs [N06AB], SNRIs [N06AB]) in the year before the first opioid dispensation.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Covariates</title><p>Demographic data, health service use, and clinical characteristics were covariates used in the analysis. As described previously and consistent with our prior work,<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> sociodemographic covariates included sex (male as reference group), current age (18-44 [reference group], 45-64, &#8805;65), region of residence (urban, rural as reference), and socioeconomic status (SES, continuous). We calculated the Socioeconomic Factor Index version 2 (SEFI-2) which integrates average household income, high school education rates, unemployment rates, and percent of single-parent households into a single score as a measure of SES.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Scores greater than 0 indicate lower SES, whereas scores less than 0 indicate more favorable socioeconomic conditions. Health service use covariates included annual number of physician visits (0-3 [reference], 4-7, &#8805;7) and annual number of classes (types) of prescription medications dispensed, at the fourth level of the ATC system (eg, by chemical subgroup) after excluding opioids (0-1, 2-3, &#8805;4). Clinical characteristics included index year (continuous), disease duration from the index date (continuous), and number of physical comorbidities (0 [reference group], 1, &#8805;2).

We estimated the crude incidence rate (new users) and prevalence of any opioid use, overall as well as stratified by sex, and age (18-44, 45-64, &#8805;65 years) for each year in the study period. Incidence rates and prevalence estimates were age- and sex-standardized to the 2010 Canadian population from the Statistics Canada census; 95% CI was based on a negative binomial distribution. We compared incidence rates and prevalence between the IBD and the reference cohorts using rate ratios and 95% CI. We used generalized linear models to test the association of disease group (IBD vs reference cohort), mood and anxiety disorders, and their interaction with opioid use. These models used a binomial distribution and included the natural log of person-time as the model offset; for the prevalence analyses, we used generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation structure.

Among persons with no psychiatric comorbidity, persons with IBD were less likely to discontinue opioids at 30 days (RR&#8197;=&#8197;0.85; 95% CI, 0.82, 0.88); they were also 2-3 times more likely to use opioids either continuously or cumulatively over 90 days (RR&#8197;=&#8197;2.42; 95% CI, 1.95, 3.01), and 6 months compared to the reference cohort (RR&#8197;=&#8197;3.35; 95% CI, 2.40, 4.67).

Over the study period, over 1 in 4 persons with IBD had at least 1 opioid dispensation. The highest rate of opioid dispensation was among persons ages 18-44 years. People with IBD were twice as likely to be prescribed opioids compared with the reference cohort across the age spectrum. Older age, being female, longer disease duration, and later year of diagnosis were all associated with lower rates of opioid use. Being in the poorest socioeconomic quintile and having greater healthcare needs or utilization were all associated with higher rates of opioid use. Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with increased incidence rates of opioid use in the IBD and reference cohorts, but the magnitude of the effect was lower in the IBD cohort. Psychiatric comorbidity was not associated with patterns of discontinuation of opioids in the IBD cohort in contrast to the reference cohort. These findings suggest that IBD may be the more relevant factor to understand higher opioid rates than psychiatric comorbidity. A similar pattern of opioid use was evident in CD and in UC. However, the incidence of opioid use was higher in CD than UC.</p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 mostly US-based studies the prevalence of opioid use in IBD in the outpatient setting was 21% (95% CI, 13%-30%).<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our findings fall within the upper limit of this range. However, these studies had heterogeneous definitions of opioid use, ranging from any prescription in the past 2 years to monthly prescriptions over 3 months, making it challenging to meaningfully interpret the meta-analysis. In a subgroup analysis of five studies of opioid users of &gt;90 days in 6 months or &gt;3 times weekly, the prevalence was 13% (95% CI, 6%-24%). Physicians providing care for IBD patients need to be vigilant with their prescribing of opioids whether it is for pain or diarrhea control, as opioid use is associated with excess mortality in the IBD population.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> While there are evident risks of opioid medication, the long-term benefits of chronic opioid use are uncertain.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Persistent opioid use rises even after short-term use, to as high as 43% after 31 days of use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In a national US insurance claims database, from 2009 to 2015, 21% of adults with IBD were prescribed opioids.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Persistent use was evident in 35% of those who were newly prescribed opioids, whether or not, there was a recent surgery.</p><p>It is unclear why the association of psychiatric comorbidity with opioid use was relatively lower in persons with IBD than the reference cohort. This may reflect a ceiling effect of opioid use due to IBD, but it may be a caution on the part of the prescriber. If the individual is already being managed medically for the IBD, and is presenting with significant mental distress, there may be a reluctance to prescribe an additional medication which requires careful oversight and has a risk of addiction. There are other complex provider&#8211;patient interaction factors that could ultimately result in less opioid dispensations in persons with IBD.</p><p>We identified several factors associated with incident opioid use. We observed a female predominance in age-standardized analyses of incident use, but this changed after we accounted for disease severity, comorbidity, medication use, healthcare visits, and socioeconomic status. After multivariable analysis, we observed that females were non-significantly more likely to have prevalent opioid use (PR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99-1.06). Prior studies have reported that being female, substance abuse, depression, somatiform symptom reporting, antidepressant use, prior gastrointestinal surgery, biologic use, and corticosteroid use are associated with prevalent opioid use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Our findings regarding psychiatric comorbidity are consistent with these observations. The combination of our findings regarding sex with those of prior studies suggests that males may be at higher risk of initiating opioid therapy after accounting for confounders, but that females may be more likely to use opioids chronically. Differences in measured confounders as well as unmeasured confounders may also play a role in differences across studies. Similarly, we found that younger age was associated with an increased incidence of opioid use, but lower prevalence of use, suggesting older age is associated with chronicity of opioid use. In a population-based study from Denmark from 1996 to 2021, older age of IBD onset was associated with higher rates of opioid use in the first year after diagnosis; however, this study had a different design and question than ours.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Our study has limitations. We could not assess the use of opioids that are available over the counter, such as acetaminophen&#8211;codeine combinations. Importantly, we did not know the indication for which opioids were prescribed; they could have been for non-IBD-related pain syndromes. Since the study relied on administrative data to identify psychiatric comorbidity, individuals who do not seek care for mental health or who seek care from nonphysician providers will not have been captured in our datasets, thus we could have underestimated the number of individuals affected by psychiatric comorbidity in persons with IBD and in the reference cohort, alike. Nonphysician providers who may not have been captured included some nurse practitioners who are salaried and psychologists who are either salaried or work privately for which their services are not reimbursed by the provincial healthcare systems. Further, the data on opioid use are fundamentally prescription data, which indicate what was dispensed but we cannot affirm what was actually used. Since persons with IBD have more physician visits than persons in the reference cohort, there could be a risk for surveillance bias; however, we specifically adjusted for annual physician visits and number of prescription drug classes used to account for this potential bias. Finally, we did not assess whether opioid use may affect the risk of incident psychiatric disorders and this should be explored in future studies. Despite these limitations, a major strength of the study is the use of population-based data over a 20-year period, with comprehensive physician visit and prescription medication capture. These findings warrant replication in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Our study reaffirms the higher rate of opioid use in persons with IBD compared to the general population and that this impacts all demographics of persons with IBD. Nearly 1 in 20 people with IBD will continue opioids for at least 6 months consecutively. Psychiatric comorbidity, which is more highly prevalent in IBD, was associated with greater relative opioid use in persons without IBD than with IBD but did not influence discontinuation of opioids. Comorbidities, lower socioeconomic status, and male sex were also associated with incident opioid use. The general harm of opioid use is well recognized. Clinicians need to be careful when considering initiation of opioid therapy in the context of psychiatric comorbidity and to review existing opioid use in their patients with IBD and work to reduce or eliminate use when appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>CIHR Team</title><p>Members of the CIHR Team in Defining the Burden and Managing the Effects of Psychiatric Comorbidity in Chronic Immunoinflammatory Disease are: R.A.M., J.M.B., J.S., S.B.P., A.S., L.M.L., C.A.H., R.E.-G., PhD, A.K., J.D.F., C.N.B., L.A.G., Lindsay Berrigan, Ryan Zarychanski, Christine Peschken, James Marriott, Kaarina Kowalec.</p><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>izae188_suppl_Supplementary_Material</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="izae188_suppl_supplementary_material.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy for use of the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository under project #2014-030 (HIPC #2014/2015-19A).
