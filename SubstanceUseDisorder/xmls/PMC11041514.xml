To date, there are limited measures to evaluate patient preferences and priorities regarding substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, and many patients do not have access to evidence-based treatment options. Patients and their families seeking SUD treatment may begin their search for an SUD treatment facility online, where they can find information about individual facilities, as well as a summary of patient-generated web-based reviews via popular platforms such as Google or Yelp. Web-based reviews of health care facilities may reflect information about factors associated with positive or negative patient satisfaction. The association between patient satisfaction with SUD treatment and drug-induced mortality is not well understood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between online review content of SUD treatment facilities and drug-induced state mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A cross-sectional analysis of online reviews and ratings of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)&#8211;designated SUD treatment facilities listed between September 2005 and October 2021 was conducted. The primary outcomes were (1) mean online rating of SUD treatment facilities from 1 star (worst) to 5 stars (best) and (2) average drug-induced mortality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER Database (2006-2019). Clusters of words with differential frequencies within reviews were identified. A 3-level linear model was used to estimate the association between online review ratings and drug-induced mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 589 SAMHSA-designated facilities (n=9597 reviews) were included in this study. Drug-induced mortality was compared with the average. Approximately half (24/47, 51%) of states had below average (&#8220;low&#8221;) mortality rates (mean 13.40, SD 2.45 deaths per 100,000 people), and half (23/47, 49%) had above average (&#8220;high&#8221;) drug-induced mortality rates (mean 21.92, SD 3.69 deaths per 100,000 people). The top 5 themes associated with low drug-induced mortality included detoxification and addiction rehabilitation services (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=0.26), gratitude for recovery (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=&#8211;0.25), thankful for treatment (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=&#8211;0.32), caring staff and amazing experience (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=&#8211;0.23), and individualized recovery programs (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=&#8211;0.20).

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 70,630 drug overdose deaths in the United States&#8212;an average of 193 deaths every day [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. People with substance use disorder (SUD) have higher prevalence rates of major medical conditions and a higher disease burden compared with the general population [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SUD-related morbidity and mortality are projected to increase over the next year [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is an increased focus on ensuring that efforts to address and reduce drug-induced morbidity and mortality are patient centered to increase adoption [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To date, there are limited measures to evaluate patient preferences and priorities regarding SUD treatment [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and many patients do not have access to evidence-based treatment options [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

While online reviews are not validated measures of quality of care as compared with Press Ganey or the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), the use of online ratings of health care experiences continues to grow, reflecting the general trend of how consumers are seeking health-related information [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Prior studies of many medical settings, including essential health care facilities [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], mental health treatment facilities [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], hospitals [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], emergency departments [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], urgent care centers [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and skilled nursing facilities, have demonstrated that online reviews may capture aspects of the patient experience that are associated with positive or negative ratings, as well as quality of care [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Online reviews of SUD treatment facilities may reflect information about factors associated with positive or negative patient satisfaction [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This content may provide insights to inform the development of SUD treatment performance metrics and patient-driven priorities. Evaluating this is important as understanding patient experiences is key to moving toward more patient-centered care and improved treatment services [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We sought to evaluate publicly available online reviews of US SUD treatment facilities to examine the association between online ratings of SUD treatment facilities and drug-induced mortality across the United States. We also aimed to explore if quality of care differences were reflected in reviews&#8217; narrative content. We examined the association between thematic content of patient-generated online reviews associated with 1-star (lowest) versus 5-star (highest) ratings and drug-induced mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>All online reviews and ratings published on Yelp for outpatient SUD treatment facilities within the United States during September 2005 to October 2021 were collected. Facilities designated as non-SUD health facilities (eg, optometrists or retirement homes) were excluded (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). Consistent with prior studies on online reviews, analysis using natural language processes was used in SUD treatment facilities with 5 or more reviews [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We matched the list of US SUD treatment facilities to their corresponding facilities in the 2016 National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facility Record published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Matching was done using facility name and address to calculate the shortest string matching Levenshtein distance [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If an SUD treatment facility was not listed within the SAMHSA directory, then it was not included in the analysis.</p><p>Drug-induced mortality rates for each state were collected from the CDC WONDER Database from 2006 to 2019, and state averages were determined. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the univariate and bivariate distributions of Yelp review ratings and drug-induced mortality rates. Drug-induced mortality was treated as a continuous variable. States were considered to have &#8220;high&#8221; drug-induced mortality if their average drug-induced mortality rate was above the mean for all states. Likewise, states were considered to have &#8220;low&#8221; drug-induced mortality if their average drug-induced mortality rate was below the mean for all states.</p></sec><sec><title>Generating Topics, Identifying Themes, and Examining Associations With Facility Online Ratings</title><p>Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a machine learning approach that groups co-occurring words into topics. These topics are then hand-coded to identify associated themes [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. LDA uses an unsupervised dimension reduction procedure [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to identify latent topics among large quantities of text. The distribution of LDA topics was extracted for each facility. Themes were categorized by an independent review by 2 members of the research team (AKA and MPA), and differences were reconciled by a third member (RMM).</p><p>Ordinary least-squares regressions were performed to generate topics associated with the drug-induced mortality rates of each facility&#8217;s state average. Pearson <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> was used to calculate effect size. For each topic generated, 10 reviews were identified. Specifically, the probability of all topics for each review was calculated, and subsequently, reviews that had the highest probability for each topic were identified. These 10 reviews were used by 3 coders (AKA, RMM, and MPA) to assign each topic a theme. The Benjamini-Hochberg <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> correction and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;.05 were used to identify significant correlations. Paired 2-tailed <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests with the Benjamini-Hochberg <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> correction were used to measure statistically significant associations between themes and state-level drug-induced mortality rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Multilevel Modeling of the Association Between Yelp Ratings and Drug-Induced Mortality Rates</title><p>Because the multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model accounts for variation at the facility level, all states with facilities with at least 5 online ratings were included (n=51 states). We used null random-intercepts models to calculate intraclass correlations and variance partitioning coefficients to determine the degree of clustering in ratings at the facility and state levels. The average correlation of ratings in the same state (ie, intraclass correlation) was 0.03, while that among ratings from the same facility was 0.21. Variance components analysis showed that 2% of the variance in ratings was explained at the state level, 17% was explained at the facility level, and the remaining 81% was within facilities.</p><p>Likelihood ratio tests revealed that models that accounted for clustering at both the facility and state level fit the data better than those that accounted for only the former (<italic toggle="yes">&#967;</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=137.7, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;.001), only the latter (<italic toggle="yes">&#967;</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=946.5, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;.001), or neither (<italic toggle="yes">&#967;</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>=1405.1, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;.001). Neither of the models that allowed the relationship between drug mortality and rating to vary at the state or facility level converged, so we proceeded with a 3-level, random-intercepts model with ratings nested in facilities and nested in states.</p><p>The 3-level, random-intercepts model used to assess the relationship between online review ratings and drug mortality rates integrated only 1 state-level predictor (drug-induced mortality rates), which was grand mean centered to improve interpretability of the intercept. As the outcome was on a 5-point Likert scale, we conducted a sensitivity analysis rerunning the model using a mixed-effects ordinal regression to see if it altered the results. There were no missing data for the predictor and outcome. All analyses were conducted in Stata (version 15; StataCorp).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>This study was considered exempt by the University of Pennsylvania institutional review board.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Descriptive Statistics of Sample</title><p>A total of 589 SUD treatment facilities listed within the SAMHSA directory (6.5% of 9061 US SAMSHA-designated facilities) met the inclusion criteria of having at least 5 reviews (n=9597 reviews; n=9597 ratings). These facilities belonged to 47 states. Most facilities represented the West US census region (n=316), followed by the South (n=130), Midwest (n=67), and Northeast (n=62). The number of online ratings of SUD treatment facilities was the same as the number of online reviews (ie, each online review had a corresponding rating, so the sample included 9597 reviews and 9597 ratings).</p><p>Ratings for the 589 facilities had a bimodal distribution with peaks at a rating of 1 (n=4546) and 5 (n=3649) with a median (IQR) of 2 (2-4).

The study has 2 main findings. First, we found that the average negative online ratings of SUD treatment facilities were associated with higher drug-induced mortality. Second, there were marked differences in the themes expressed between high versus low mortality states. These findings provide insights about the gap that persists in understanding the associations between online reviews and drug-induced mortality outcomes. Further, these results may help amplify patient-generated perceptions of poor quality of SUD care that may contribute to increased drug-induced mortality.</p><p>For every 10 deaths per capita increase in drug-induced mortality, the Yelp rating is expected to be 0.3 points lower. This is important, as little research has been conducted to closely examine the association between the online ratings and morbidity and mortality outcomes in the context of SUD treatment [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consistent with a prior report that found that higher online ratings of essential health care facilities were associated with lower mortality [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], our findings suggest that online ratings may serve as a proxy for some components of quality of care such as communication with patients or availability of evidence-based treatments. This work also provides evidence that tools such as ATLAS [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a website developed to help patients find and compare SUD treatment facilities, may have value in guiding patients to care options that fit their needs and preferences.</p><p>Recently, the Shatterproof foundation developed National Principles of Care for addiction treatment, evidence-based practices to improve outcomes for individuals with SUD [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Themes associated with low mortality were consistent with these principles. For example, their second principle, &#8220;A personal plan for every patient,&#8221; matched the theme &#8220;individualized recovery programs.&#8221; This theme is also in line with a recent partnership between Shatterproof, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and OpenBeds to create a free, 13-item assessment to determine what type of SUD treatment aligns best with each patient&#8217;s needs [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>These findings provide insights into aspects of patient experience within SUD care that are often difficult to capture with numerical surveys including a focus on &#8220;caring staff&#8221; and &#8220;communication.&#8221; Themes associated with high mortality states often pertained to poor communication and low-quality or non&#8211;evidenced-based care. Many of these identified themes can guide areas of improvement regarding the delivery of patient-centered and high-quality care. The identified themes indicate aspects of the patient experience that may contribute to high and low state-level mortality. Ultimately, these results underscore a process to unify patients&#8217; &#8220;digital voices&#8221; to improve and inform treatment for SUD.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. Reviews in the sample represent a small proportion of a facility&#8217;s patients, and facilities included represent a very small proportion of the SUD treatment infrastructure. Further, online reviews may not be representative of the population seen at each facility because Yelp does not verify the identity of the user posting a rating or review. Therefore, the use of only Yelp reviews as a source of online ratings and reviews may limit the impact of our findings. Additionally, 4 states (including Washington DC) did not have SUD treatment facilities with more than 5 reviews, limiting conclusions that can be drawn about the association between themes in online ratings and mortality in those states. Further, consistent with previously published methods [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to analyze thematic online review content, the analyses in this study were not stratified by year, which limits conclusions that can be drawn. Specifically, our data are limited by the fact that the distribution of ratings by year is slightly skewed toward later years when reviews of health centers on Yelp became more popular. Other limitations of this study include its retrospective design, selection bias, and responder bias. A final limitation is that due to our sample size, our analyses were limited to mortality data at the state level despite the fact that county-level mortality data are generally available, so we could not explore facility-level services or practices that may contribute to high drug mortality. If more reviews become available, a county-level analysis in the future may provide more granular results. Our team attempted to run a similar analysis at the county level, but the intersection of mortality data from CDC and review data from Yelp was very small. Likewise, there may be possible heterogeneity across SUD populations in different states that limits the impact of these findings, as well as differences in state-level investment in SUD care and responses to drug-induced mortality rates that vary depending on state-level priorities and budgetary restrictions. Although state policy likely is linked to mortality, state-level policy differences were not likely captured in the patient-generated online content analyzed in this study.</p><p>This study also has strengths. Online review platforms serve as an organic, democratizing, and accessible space for patients to document their care experiences with rich narratives. While reviews are not representative, Yelp uses software in place to filter out inappropriate or inaccurate reviews. Moreover, the anonymity of reviews may encourage patients to express the true realities of their experiences without fear that it will impact their care. Therefore, analyses of online review content can provide insights to improve patient experiences and treatment delivery that may not be captured by numerical surveys or patient experiences surveys where patients may be concerned that their anonymity is not protected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>At the state level, mean negative online ratings of SUD treatment facilities were associated with higher drug-induced mortality. Additionally, unique narrative content themes were identified online reviews across states with low or high mortality. Online reviews of SUD treatment facilities provide an opportunity to investigate and understand elements of the patient experience, quality of care, and state level mortality. The themes generated from online, organically derived patient content can inform and improve patient-centered care for SUD treatment. Future efforts to integrate these themes into the development of an SUD treatment facility-based performance and quality measures for SUD treatment may help to further elucidate what aspects of patient care may promote or improve both patient satisfaction and drug-induced mortality.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the faculty and staff of the Center for Digital Health and the Center for Emergency Care Policy and Research at the University of Pennsylvania for their support of this work.
