Therefore, early identification of individuals with major risk factors for CVD is a cornerstone for the effective and efficient prevention of CVD. Accordingly, the Japanese government implemented an annual health check-up program for middle-aged or older adults (40&#8211;74 years) in 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The health check-up program comprises two stages: (1) a physical examination and laboratory testing and (2) follow-up health guidance (consisting of either or both a lifestyle consultation and a recommended visit to a clinic) if identified as having a high CVD risk (detailed below).</p><p>Recently, a systematic review raised concerns about the effectiveness of health check-ups in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, several investigations on Japan&#8217;s general health check-up program found limited effectiveness in CVD outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A study pointed out that the limited effectiveness is partly due to the low adherence to health guidance invitations. Individuals who received health guidance showed significant body weight loss, while 15.9% of eligible participants in the study received lifestyle consultations [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, barriers to adherence to follow-up health guidance invitations in the program are unknown because previous investigations focused on adherence to attending health check-ups [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, it is vital that detailed adherence patterns of this program are described, and any barriers to adherence to health guidance invitations are identified. By using health claims data provided by one of the largest employer-sponsored insurer in Japan, we aimed to characterize the adherence patterns of the annual CVD risk evaluation program for the general population in Japan and identify the major predictors of adherence to health guidance invitations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The present study was reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <bold>(see <xref rid="pone.0286317.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>)</bold>.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>National health check-up program in Japan</title><p>Japan&#8217;s national health check-up program is a government-led nationwide screening program (<italic toggle="yes">Tokutei Kenshin</italic> in Japanese) that examines CVD risk factors in middle-aged and older adults (40&#8211;74 years), with a particular focus on metabolic syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

In addition, if the members are employed, the employers are also obliged to provide them with the opportunity to attend health check-ups.</p><p>At the beginning of a fiscal year (from April to March in Japan), insurers provide eligibility to receive health check-ups and determine the date of attendance for individuals who have a birthday to be 40&#8211;75 years old in the fiscal year. Individuals at 74 years old at the beginning of the fiscal year should receive health check-ups before their 75th birthday. All individuals who underwent health check-ups received their results via mail. A high CVD risk was defined as obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#8805; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or waist circumference &#8805; 85 cm in men or &#8805; 90 cm in women) plus at least one of the following conditions: systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#8805; 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#8805; 85 mmHg; fasting blood glucose (FBG) &#8805; 100 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &#8805; 5.6%; triglyceride (TG) &#8805; 150 mg/dL or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) &#8804; 40 mg/dL [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If participants were already taking prescribed medication for hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), or dyslipidemia (based on self-reporting), they were instructed to continue routine clinic visits. Otherwise, individuals meeting the definition of high CVD risk receive subsequent invitations by insurers to receive lifestyle consultations or visit clinics.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Additional interventions for selected high-risk individuals to urge them to receive health guidance</title><p>Insurers were allowed to design and conduct additional interventions for selected high-risk individuals to urge them to receive lifestyle consultations or visit clinics.

Telephone-based follow-ups were conducted for participants who received lifestyle consultations. The Follow-up interval for each participant was determined according to the number of criteria for high CVD risk the participant met and the participant&#8217;s age and smoking status. Insured members were able to select a hospital or clinic to receive health check-ups, lifestyle consultations, or direct clinic visits.

To identify predictors of improved adherence to health guidance invitation, we investigated 30,979 adults invited for health guidance in the fiscal year 2017. Since detailed data were only available among those who attended health check-ups, we explored predictors for adherence to health guidance invitations but not adherence to attending health check-ups. In addition, we excluded a relatively small proportion of individuals who were lost to follow-up for health guidance (785/ 30,979 [2.5%]). Thus, 30,194 adults were included in the main analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Potential predictors</title><p>We explored available variables as potential predictors: age (categorized into five-year age groups based on their age at the check-ups except that individuals who attended earlier than their 40<sup>th</sup> birthday in the fiscal year were also classified as 40&#8211;44); sex; insured status (main insured person or family member); self-reported behavioral patterns (smoking status [current smoking or not], alcohol consumption [no consumption, more than 60 g alcohol daily, or any other types of consumption], and exercise habits [more than 30 minutes of physical exercise on more than one day per week or not]); self-reported motivation for a lifestyle change (uninterested in, interested in, or starting lifestyle change); and blood pressure and laboratory results (categorized for HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia by the thresholds used to determine a specific health guidance invitation intensity in the program, as described in <bold><xref rid="pone.0286317.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).

As 16.7% (4,449/ 30,979) of the participants invited for health guidance had at least one missing variable, we implemented multiple imputations using the chained equation (MICE) method [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An interview with the database provider indicated that those missing values occurred independently from an individual&#8217;s characteristics or actual values but based on which clinics or hospitals the check-ups took place. The imputation model included all variables in the logistic regression model and the information of the lost to follow-up. We generated five imputations with five imputation cycles.</p><p>In addition, we conducted two pre-specified sensitivity analyses. First, to account for attrition due to loss to follow-up, we performed the same regression with inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) by calculating the probability of being lost to follow-up by logistic regression with the same predictor variables. The probability of censoring was calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model, which included all predictors noted under the "<italic toggle="yes">Potential predictors</italic>" sub-heading. Observations with missing values were excluded from the analysis. Second, we conducted the same regression with &#8217;complete&#8217; cases with all necessary data and follow-up for 365 days.

The adherence rate in eligible individuals was 71.7% for attending health check-ups but remained as low as 35.2% for health guidance invitations. Older age, more concerning results in terms of HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia, and self-reported motivation for lifestyle change were associated with improved adherence to health guidance invitation. These results were consistent in several sensitivity analyses.</p><p>We confirmed low adherence to health guidance invitations even though the program took place in a highly accessible healthcare system [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that the adherence rate to attending health check-ups was two times higher than to health guidance invitations, there should be some specific reasons for low adherence to health guidance invitations. The lack of employers&#8217; support would explain the low adherence because employers&#8217; obligation by law is to provide employees with opportunities for attending health check-ups but not for receiving health guidance [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, adherence to health guidance invitations doubled when employers received warnings from insurers, compared to when only participants received specially designed letters urging direct clinic visits.</p><p>Older age was associated with higher adherence to health guidance invitations. More aged individuals would be more likely to pay attention to their health [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and have higher chances of visiting clinics or hospitals for other reasons than younger adults [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such visits may work as &#8217;nudges&#8217; to receive health guidance. In addition, older adults may have fewer working hours than younger adults [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], resulting in more flexibility in their daily schedules to visit a healthcare facility.</p><p>The more concerning results regarding HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia were another predictor of improved adherence. This finding contrasts with previous research that identified good health status as a predictor of receiving health check-ups [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both numeric information on those risk factors (e.g., blood pressure or laboratory test results) and the intensity of recommendation procedures (e.g., specific letter design and employer involvement) would have contributed to better adherence in individuals with more concerning results. Indeed, Iizuka et al. [<xref rid="pone.0286317.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that information exceeding a specific clinical threshold independently improved adherence to health guidance invitations in this health check-up program.</p><p>Our findings indicate that future policy reforms designed to improve adherence to health check-up programs should target younger individuals, those with mild stages of HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia, and those with low motivation for a lifestyle change. Such interventions may include specific letter designs for selected individuals according to the predictors of adherence. Future studies on predictors from other aspects, such as socioeconomic or geographic status, are necessary to offer additional implications.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the generalizability of the study findings (particularly descriptive statistics) is limited, given that the study population consisted of workers in the field of architecture and civil engineering or their family members. The results may differ for workers in other fields with different sociodemographic backgrounds. Second, reflecting the nature of administrative data, there remains the possibility of misclassification of the study variables. For example, the observed clinic visits with relevant disease codes might not be in response to the health guidance invitation. Third, the definition of the high CVD risk in Japan&#8217;s health check-up program, which emphasizes waist circumference, significantly differs from other commonly used risk prediction tools. For example, elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol was not considered a high-risk indicator; and people with low or normal BMI with normal waist circumflex were excluded, though many of them may have had other CVD risk factors such as HT, DM, and dyslipidemia. This difference may limit the generalizability of our findings to individuals identified as high-risk using other risk prediction tools. Fourth, the study found a male predominance (90%) among those invited for health guidance, in contrast to the 58% male attendance at health check-ups. This deviation would also be attributed to the health check-up program&#8217;s definition of high CVD risk. Last, our findings may be confounded by unmeasured or residual confounding factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In Japan&#8217;s nationwide health check-up program (<italic toggle="yes">Tokutei Kenshin</italic>), the adherence rate to attending check-ups was around 70%, but adherence to subsequent health guidance invitations remained at 35%. Older age, more concerning results in terms of HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia, and self-reported motivation for a lifestyle change were major predictors of improved adherence to health guidance invitation.

</p><p>Our responses are provided, along with comments from editors and reviewers.</p><p>1. Title: The study is not of the general population in Japan, but of a selected group of individuals (employees in architecture or civil engineering companies and their family members). The data source is an insurer database. The title needs to reflect these.</p><p>We appreciate the reasonable suggestion. We have modified the title accordingly. The revised title is "Patterns and predictors of adherence to follow-up health guidance invitations in a general health check-up program in Japan: a cohort study with an employer-sponsored insurer database".</p><p>2. Why was an insurer database for employees in architecture or civil engineering companies and their family members selected? Why were other employment categories not included? This needs discussion/ justification.</p><p>We appreciate the comment which clarifies the reason for the data source selection. We selected this insurer for the analysis because it is one of the largest employer-sponsored health insurers in Japan, covering 400 thousand of individuals. In addition, the wording and design for the health guidance invitation remained consistent throughout the study period. Therefore, we included this explanation in the Data source section in Methods.</p><p>"... This database includes information on employees in architecture or civil engineering companies and their family members who other insurers do not cover. We selected this insurer for the analysis because it is one of the largest employer-sponsored health insurers in Japan, covering 400 thousand of individuals. In addition, the wording and design for the health guidance invitation remained consistent throughout the study period. The database contains demographic characteristics, medical history, &#8230;"</p><p>3. High CVD risk was defined as obesity PLUS hypertension, diabetes/pre-diabetes, and high TG or low HDL. Elevated LDL was not considered as a high-risk indicator &#8211; why? People with low or normal BMI were excluded, and many of them may have had other CVD risk factors such as HT, DM, DL. This needs discussion/ justification.</p><p>We agree that the comment is a reasonable criticism of Japan's general health check-up program. However, the government has defined the definition of high CVD risk from the beginning of the program. Therefore, the definition was not under our control. Given the discrepancy between the cutoffs to predict high CVD risk between the program and commonly used prediction tools, we modified the limitation paragraph to reflect this issue. Please refer to the answer to comment 4.</p><p>4. Many other population-based studies and/or screening programmes use risk scores from a risk prediction tool (such as the Framingham score) to identify individuals at high CVD risk. How does the method used for detecting high risk individuals in the present study compare with these methods? Please discuss.</p><p>As per the answer to comment 3, the criteria to define high CVD risk significantly differ from other commonly used prediction tools. This difference may limit the generalizability of our findings to individuals identified as high-risk using other risk prediction tools. We edited the limitation paragraph to reflect this issue.</p><p>". Third, the definition of the high CVD risk in Japan's health check-up program, which emphasizes waist circumference, significantly differs from other commonly used risk prediction tools. This difference may limit the generalizability of our findings to individuals identified as high-risk using other risk prediction tools. Fourth, &#8230;"</p><p>5. This data is unlikely to be representative of the Japanese population at large due to several reasons: 90% of study population were men; only one selected category of employees/ professionals (this is addressed by the authors); data source was the database of one main insurer, and there is no data on individuals with other insurers. How many of the Japanese population are registered with this insurer? These limitations need to be discussed.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion that the deviation of our cohort from the general population should be discussed. We want to note that the proportion of males in those who attended health check-ups was 58%, much closer to the general population than 90%. Therefore, we suggest that the main source of the deviation would be the definition of high CVD risk rather than population characteristics. We additionally discussed this issue in the limitation paragraph.</p><p>"&#8230; Fourth, the study found a male predominance (90%) among those invited for health guidance, in contrast to the 58% male attendance at health check-ups. This deviation would also be attributed to the health check-up program's definition of high CVD risk. &#8230;"</p><p>6. Adherence to health guidance was ascertained from records of lifestyle consultation or clinic visit on the insurer database. There was no direct ascertainment from individuals. This is a limitation that can affect the accuracy of the findings. Needs discussion.</p><p>We agree there would be misclassifications in the ascertained clinic visits in response to health guidance invitations. Therefore, we also have included this point in the limitation paragraph.</p><p>"Second, reflecting the nature of administrative data, there remains the possibility of misclassification of the study variables. For example, the observed clinic visits with relevant disease codes might not be in response to the health guidance invitation."</p><p>7. There is no discussion on how these findings compare with studies done elsewhere. The discussion needs to be expanded with references to such findings.</p><p>While there have been several studies on the predictors of receiving health check-ups, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to investigate the predictors of attending follow-up risk-stratified interventions after health check-ups. In light of this, we have revised the fourth paragraph of the discussion section to provide a comparison of our findings with previous research on predictors of receiving health check-ups. We acknowledge the valuable feedback received, which has enabled us to make our discussion more informative and precise.</p><p>"The more concerning results regarding HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia were another predictor of improved adherence. This finding contrasts with previous research that identified good health status as a predictor of receiving health check-ups (3). Both numeric information on those risk factors (e.g., blood pressure or laboratory test results) and the intensity of recommendation procedures (e.g., specific letter design and employer involvement) would have contributed to better adherence in individuals with more concerning results. &#8230;"</p><p>8. What are the strengths of the study, that would warrant its publication?</p><p>To our best knowledge, this study first examined adherence patterns and predictors of attending follow-up risk-stratified interventions after health check-ups. These findings have important implications for healthcare providers designing follow-up interventions after health check-ups, particularly for individuals with chronic conditions.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Results: Pg 9: Line 245; says '&#8230;.97.5% (n = 30,979) were followed up for 365 days &#8230;'. Is this correct? Or should it say (n = 30,194)? Please check.</p><p>Thank you for the correction. As the comment indicates, 97.5% (n = 30,194) were followed up for 365 days. We corrected the paragraph as suggested. The revised version of the paragraph is shown below. The number "35.2%" did not need correction as 10,614/30,194 equals to 35.15&#8230;, which can be rounded to 35.2.</p><p>"In 2017, 71.7% of the population (133,573/ 186,316) attended a health check-up (Figure 2). Among those 133,573 individuals, 25.7% (n = 34,294) were taking prescribed medication for HTN, DM, or dyslipidemia, and 23.2% (n = 30,979) were invited for health guidance as having a high CVD risk and without such medications; of these 30,979 invited for health guidance, 97.5% (n = 30,194) were followed up for 365 days from their check-ups. Of these 30,194 individuals, 35.2% (n = 10,614) received health guidance within 365 days."</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0286317.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0286317.s004.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0286317.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0286317.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Nuwaha</surname><given-names initials="F">Fred</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Fred Nuwaha</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Fred Nuwaha</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0286317"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

Third, the definition of the high CVD risk in Japan&#8217;s health check-up program, which emphasizes waist circumference, significantly differs from other commonly used risk prediction tools. For example, elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol was not considered a high-risk indicator; and people with low or normal BMI with normal waist circumflex were excluded, though many of them may have had other CVD risk factors such as HT, DM, and dyslipidemia. This difference may limit the generalizability of our findings to individuals identified as high-risk using other risk prediction tools. &#8230;"</p><p>2.
