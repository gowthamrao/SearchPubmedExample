This review aims to comprehensively assess predictive factors for both the first occurrence and subsequent risk of esophageal variceal bleeding. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and Cochrane databases. A total of 33 studies were selected using rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Several predictive factors were identified for esophageal variceal bleeding, including the Child-Pugh score, Fibrosis Index, specific endoscopic findings, ultrasound parameters, portal vein diameter, presence and size of collaterals, CT scan findings, ascites, platelet counts, coagulation parameters, albumin levels, Von Willebrand Factor, bilirubin levels, diabetes mellitus, and the use of b-blocking agents in primary prophylaxis. The findings of this systematic review shed light on multiple potential predictive factors for esophageal variceal bleeding. Endoscopic findings were found to be reliable predictors. Additionally, ultrasound parameters showed associations with bleeding risk. This systematic review identifies multiple potential predictive factors for esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension. While certain factors exhibit strong predictive capabilities, further research is needed to refine and validate these findings, considering potential limitations and biases. This study serves as a critical resource for bridging knowledge gaps in this field.&#160;</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>systematic review</kwd><kwd>internal medicine</kwd><kwd>risk of bleeding</kwd><kwd>gastroenterology</kwd><kwd>esophageal varcices</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal distal esophageal veins connecting the portal and systemic circulations [&#8203;1]. The response of the body to the increased venous pressure is the development of collaterals. These portosystemic collaterals divert blood from the portal venous system to the inferior and superior vena cava. At the same time, one important system is the gastroesophageal collaterals that drain into the azygos vein and lead to the development of esophageal varices. When these varices get enlarged, they rupture, causing severe hemorrhage&#8203; [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. &#8203;&#8239;&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Variceal hemorrhage represents approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) episodes in patients with portal hypertension. In a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States from 2005 to 2014, a total of 348,958 (34,895 per year) patients were hospitalized with esophageal variceal bleeding&#8203; [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; furthermore, the mortality rate in patients with acute variceal bleeding is as high as 12-22% &#8203;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#8203; &#8239;&#160;</p><p>Predicting the occurrence of esophageal variceal bleeding and effectively stratifying individuals susceptible to this condition holds the promise of significantly reducing hospitalizations and mortality rates. Several scoring systems have been developed for the assessment of patients with UGB to predict clinical outcomes. The most frequently used are the Rockfall score, the Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS), and AIMS65 (albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), mental status, systolic blood pressure, age &gt;65 years) [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, these scoring systems are limited to assessing post-bleed risk [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], leaving&#8203; a critical gap in predicting the initial bleeding episode. This study aims to comprehensively assess predictive factors for both the first occurrence and the subsequent risk of esophageal variceal bleeding.&#8239;&#8239;&#160;</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methods</p><p>Search Strategy</p><p>Pubmed/MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online and Cochrane databases were searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text terms (Tables <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) on September 19, 2023.&#8239; This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the selection of articles for the systematic review and meta-analysis [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#8239; This rigorous approach resulted in a homogeneous dataset, allowing for more accurate and reliable results.&#8239;&#160;</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title> Search terms on PubMed/MEDLINE</title><p>MEDLINE: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Search&#8239;&#8239;terms</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Results&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">((Esophageal Varices[MeSH Terms]) OR (Variceal Bleeding[MeSH Terms]) OR (Esophageal Hemorrhage[MeSH Terms]) OR (Esophageal Variceal Disease[Title/Abstract])) AND ((risk assessment[MeSH Terms]) OR (Predictive Factors[MeSH Terms]) OR (Bleeding Risk[Title/Abstract]) OR (Hemorrhage Risk[Title/Abstract]) OR (Predictors[Title/Abstract]) OR (Risk Factors[Title/Abstract]))&#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1414&#8239;&#160; &#8239;&#160;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB2" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Search on Cochrane </title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Search&#8239; terms</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Results&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#1 MeSH descriptor: [Esophageal and Gastric Varices] explode all trees&#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1031&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#2 (Esophageal Variceal Disease):ti,ab,kw &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">309&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#3 MeSH descriptor: [Risk Assessment] explode all trees &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13634&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#4 (Bleeding Risk):ti,ab,kw &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15651&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#5 (Hemorrhage Risk):ti,ab,kw &#8239;&#160; &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10756&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#6 (Predictors):ti,ab,kw &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23474&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#7 (Risk factors):ti,ab,kw &#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">90879&#8239;&#160;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">#8 (#1 OR #2) AND (#3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 OR #7)&#8239;&#160;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">326&#8239;&#160;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</p><p>The review included studies that satisfied the search terms, were published between 2003 and 2023, and were written in either Spanish or English. A rigorous exclusion criterion was applied to ensure the quality and relevance of the studies included in the analysis. Studies with participants who were not diagnosed with portal hypertension were excluded. In addition, studies that were not available in full text or could not be obtained through interlibrary loans were excluded. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria in different categories are detailed below.</p><p>Types of studies: Observational studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies were included. Case reports, case series, cross-sectional studies, dissertations, book chapters, protocol articles, reviews, news articles, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, editorials, and comment publications were excluded, as these may not provide the depth of data required for our analysis. Additionally, studies lacking a clear operationalization description, duplicates, and those where necessary data couldn&#8217;t be obtained or where we didn&#8217;t receive a response from the original author were also excluded, ensuring the precision and reliability of the studies included in our systematic review.&#8239;&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Types of participants: Studies with adult participants (aged &#8805; 18 years) of all genders diagnosed with portal hypertension, regardless of its etiology, were included. Patients with confirmed esophageal varices through relevant diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy, imaging, or clinical assessment. We included patients with or without a history of bleeding secondary to esophageal varices. On the other hand, patients without a diagnosis of portal hypertension, those experiencing UGB unrelated to esophageal varices (including gastric varices, esophageal trauma, gastric mucosal lesions, benign or malignant tumors of the stomach and esophagus, and peptic ulcer disease) were excluded. Studies pertaining to UGB secondary to coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy and pediatric populations (individuals under 18 years of age) were also excluded. These refined criteria aim to enhance the study&#8217;s focus and ensure the selection of appropriate participants for investigating predictive factors associated with the risk of bleeding in esophageal variceal disease.&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Types of intervention: In this review, there was no specified type of intervention outlined within the methodology. Unlike some research studies that focus on evaluating specific interventions or treatment, the primary aim of the current review was to identify and assess predictive factors associated with the risk of bleeding in esophageal variceal disease like portal hypertension severity, variceal size and location, liver function, coagulation profile, and other relevant parameters. The goal was to comprehensively understand and delineate these factors that could aid in early interventions, better prognosis, and management strategies with a posterior reduction in mortality and number of hospitalizations. This allows for a broad investigation into clinical and diagnostic factors without being confined to a specific intervention or treatment modality.&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Outcomes: Studies that focused on identifying predictive factors associated with bleeding risk in esophageal variceal disease were included. Participants should have undergone an assessment of predictive factors for bleeding in esophageal variceal disease; participants with incomplete or missing data on this matter will be excluded. Studies that aimed to establish correlations between these factors and the occurrence of bleeding in esophageal varices were included.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Selection of Studies/Data Extraction&#8239;</italic>&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Following an initial screening based on the title and abstract, two reviewers (MMM and JACP) independently selected trials for inclusion in this review using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#8239; This search was performed by using Rayyan&#8203; [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]&#8203; to extract relevant data; duplicates were filtered.

Other factors were diabetes mellitus (6.1%), the use of sorafenib in HCC (3%) and prophylactic nonselective beta&#8208;blocker (NSBB) in cirrhosis (3%). It is important to state the predictive scores, models and indexes used many parameters including some of the previously mentioned factors and others like: alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), RBC, CT features of the liver and spleen, glucagonemia and interventional radiology (IR), age, alcohol and smoking history (Table <xref rid="TAB4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).&#160;</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Predictive Factors</p><p>The Child-Pugh score, evaluated across multiple articles [&#8203;20,22,24,37], plays a significant role in assessing the risk of bleeding in cirrhotic inpatients. Specifically, rebleeding in cirrhotic inpatients was associated with Child-Pugh grade B [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Child-Pugh score is a well-established system used to evaluate the severity of cirrhosis, with Grade B indicating a moderate degree of liver dysfunction. In the context of variceal bleeding risk, this grade signifies a higher risk of rebleeding.&#160;</p><p>The Fibrosis Index stands out as a genuinely predictive factor, and what's even more reassuring is that the studies investigating it were of high quality. The Fibrosis index with a cut-off value of 3.95 showed a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.3% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) of 62.95% for predicting f within one year [<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].&#160;FIB-4 appears to be the most efficient non-invasive liver fibrosis marker which can be used as an initial screening tool for cirrhotic patients [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Ultrasound, Endoscopy, and Other Imaging Values</p><p>Predictive factors for rebleeding identified through endoscopy encompassed specific findings, which included the presence of the red wale sign or cherry red spot, esophageal variceal grading, and the number of band ligations performed [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These factors were consistently supported across multiple articles, and their reliability was reinforced by their low risk of bias.&#160;</p><p>Ultrasound analysis revealed significant associations, such as the assessment of left gastric vein hemodynamics. Notably, EVB was more frequently observed in patients with a left gastric vein diameter exceeding 6 mm and a hepatofugal flow velocity surpassing 15 cm/s [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, a comprehensive MUI (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-Ultrasound Doppler index), which factored in the assessment of the left gastric vein, emerged as another predictive factor [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While both articles exhibited a fair quality concerning the risk of bias, the consensus drawn from their findings underscores the strength of these factors as reliable predictors.&#160;</p><p>High liver stiffness, as determined through ultrasound evaluation, has been established as a reliable predictor of bleeding risk [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This finding is further corroborated by an additional study indicating that low liver stiffness measurements effectively excluded patients with high-risk varices, particularly in individuals with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, spleen stiffness demonstrates a correlation with the presence, severity, and bleeding risk of esophageal varices, as indicated in one study; however, it&#8217;s worth noting that this study was of suboptimal quality due to a risk of bias [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].&#160;</p><p>Qingjing Zhu et al. present strong evidence that both spleen and liver stiffness are excellent predictors of liver stiffness measurement and spleen diameter, with the study&#8217;s quality being good [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize that these factors are interconnected and not necessarily independent of each other, limiting the findings of the spleen diameter as a predictor. This interrelation suggests that the outcome of one factor might be influenced by another. In summary, liver stiffness is a reliable predictor, while spleen diameter requires further research and exploration to fully understand its predictive capabilities.&#160;</p><p>Another factor evaluated by ultrasound was the portal vein diameter. Patients with variceal red signs had significantly higher values of portal diameter, cross-sectional area, blood flow volume, and congestion index [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The high risk of bias in the study limits the interpretation. Hepatic vein pressure gradient is a predictive factor for six-week rebleed episode [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].&#8239;&#160;</p><p>Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) elevates the incidence of high-risk varices and EVB [<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This underscores the clinical significance of PVTT in patients, particularly those with HCC, in terms of the associated risk of these adverse outcomes. Gao et al. further substantiate this by indicating that patients with PVTT exhibit a higher rate of rebleeding, both at the 14-day and six-week intervals [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This reinforces the idea that PVTT contributes to the risk of variceal bleeding recurrence.&#160;</p><p>The utilization of CT scans as an imaging tool in assessing esophageal varices and their potential to predict bleeding events have been the subject of recent investigations, notably in high-quality studies: the total area of esophageal varices showed more accuracy (being 7.83&#177;2.76mm in bleeding group) as a potential and novel indicator for bleeding prediction [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Findings of esophageal varices in&#160;multidetector CT (MDCT) analysis were the best predictor of esophageal varices or esophageal variceal hemorrhage, and the presence (and/or size) of specific collaterals showed a significant relationship with both esophageal varices and esophageal variceal hemorrhage: coronary, short gastric, and paraesophageal [<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These particular findings not only provide a novel indicator for predicting bleeding but also underscore the potential of CT scans to offer precise assessments of esophageal varices, enhancing clinical decision-making. Therefore, it is advisable that CT scans be integrated more widely into the clinical management of patients with esophageal varices, particularly in the context of risk assessment and preventive measures.&#160;</p><p>Another imaging measurement provided by the analysis of a dual-energy CT scan was the iodine concentration in the short gastric vein and in the spleen [<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and although they were found to be independent predictors for EVB risk, usefulness as a predictor of EVB is limited due to a high risk of bias of the study.&#160;</p><p>Ascites</p><p>Ascites was determined to be a risk factor for variceal bleeding according to the findings of Krige et al. [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Yang et al. [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and Hung et al. [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], two of them being high-quality studies. Goh et al.'s study, which had low risk of bias, determine thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, or ascites as unreliable predictors of bleeding esophageal varices [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is interesting to notice that only 27.5% of patients evaluated in this study had ascites.&#160;Only six patients had the three criteria, so we could consider that the sample size was relatively small to conclude that ascites is not related to the risk of bleeding. Wang et al. [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] determined that ascites was negatively correlated to EVB, although this study had a high risk of bias, therefore being less significative than the previous ones stating the opposite.&#160;</p><p>Platelets&#160;</p><p>Our comprehensive review of high-quality studies reveals a consistent consensus that questions the utility of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and ascites as reliable predictors of EVB in patients with liver cirrhosis. Goh et al. emphasize the unreliability of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and ascites in predicting EVB [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This challenges the traditional view that low platelet count indicates EVB risk, highlighting the need for a reevaluation of the factors contributing to EVB. Giannini et al. support the notion that platelet counts are not suitable predictors for post-endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVBL) bleeding [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings suggest the limitations of these commonly considered parameters in assessing EVB risk.&#160;</p><p>Laboratory Values</p><p>Low fibrinogen levels are associated with an increased risk of bleeding following prophylactic EVBL in cirrhotic patients and may be used to stratify patients' risk [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another coagulation parameter considered to be a predictor of variceal bleeding is the Von Willebrand Factor (vEF) and the VITRO (vEF antigen/ platelet count) score [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although our analysis determined this study to have a high risk of bias, therefore being limited in its application in predicting bleeding from esophageal varices.&#160;</p><p>Albumin was introduced as a variable considered in clinical radiomics nomogram to predict EVB in cirrhotic patients [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It&#8217;s important to highlight the study&#8217;s high risk of bias. PVT and low albumin levels &lt;30 g/l were identified as potential predictors for six-week rebleeding following EVBL [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, further analysis revealed that only PVT remained as an independent factor and albumin did not retain its predictive power in this context. The presence of PVT in cirrhotic patients often complicates the clinical picture, and it can be a crucial factor in assessing rebleeding risk. However, the limitations of the high risk of bias in this study should be taken into account, and further investigations are necessary to confirm these results.&#160;</p><p>The role of high creatinine levels in predicting rebleeding in cirrhotic inpatients has been examined by Wang et al. [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, their study's quality does not meet the criteria required for robust predictive factors. As a result, the reliability of high creatinine as an independent predictor for rebleeding remains questionable. In a study by Luo et al., AST levels were considered part of a clinical radiomics nomogram thar can noninvasively predict whether cirrhotic patients will develop EVB [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, it&#8217;s important to notice the quality of their study was poor and there was simultaneous evaluation of albumin, fibrinogen, PVT, AST, and spleen thickness. Further research is needed to validate the findings and assess the generalizability of the clinical-radiomics model. Future studies should also explore the feasibility of implementing this nomogram in clinical practice.&#160;</p><p>Bilirubin levels were also considered by two different studies [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and both found that high bilirubin levels are directly correlated to rebleeding of esophageal varices. However, it is important to take into account that one of them has a high risk of bias, needing further investigation on this parameter.&#160;</p><p>Other Predictive Factors</p><p>Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes mellitus has been considered a potential predictive factor for bleeding, especially in those with Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis, as indicated in a study by Yang et al. [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with a fair quality in terms of potential bias. Notably, it's intriguing to observe that a higher percentage of patients with diabetes were in Child-Pugh Class B/C, experiencing renal insufficiency, and having a history of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the the outcomes of Yang et al.'s study might have been influenced by the specific characteristics of the population under investigation. Furthermore, the study was constrained by a relatively small number of patients. Diabetes was also a subject of evaluation in a separate study, which also examined age, ascites, and alcohol-related disorders as potential factors, and this study was of good quality [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the need for further research in this area remains, given the complex interplay of factors and potential limitations in the existing studies.&#160;</p><p>Beta-blockers: According to Kim et al., patients who had their first episode of variceal bleeding while on primary prophylaxis with a b-blocking agent have an increased risk of further bleeding [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, their study had a poor quality and there is no support from other studies.</p><p>Protective Factor</p><p>High albumin levels were stated to serve as a protective factor by Gao et al. [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but the high risk of bias of their study subjects this factor to further evaluation in the future. No further studies found protective factors for EVB.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>It is essential to recognize that existing research has limitations, including varied treatment protocols and potential biases. The review adhered to its inclusion criteria for patients with hepatic cirrhosis of all etiologies; however, some studied patients were exposed to cirrhosis of infectious causes, primarily hepatitis B or C, and of HCC in a compensated state. These characteristics could potentially have influenced our findings. It is noteworthy that our research was limited to a specific number of academic databases, focused on articles published in English and Spanish, and was based on a specific time frame. As a result, we understand that there may be a potential bias due to these limitations that defined our search methodology. Therefore, there is a risk of omission of older studies and relevant research in different languages. The possibility that literature that is under review or in the editing process for publication may have been missed is also something to consider. Despite our dedicated search methodology and efforts to include worldwide studies, Asian regions predominated, which could influence our conclusion. It is possible that other publications may have escaped our attention and analysis.&#160;It is important to highlight that this is an exceptional systematic review on this topic, for which there were no previous peers, providing essential information that could bridge potential gaps in knowledge.&#160;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This comprehensive systematic review has explored a wide range of factors associated with the risk of EVB in patients with portal hypertension.

The primary findings suggest that the Child-Pugh score, Fibrosis Index, specific endoscopic findings, ultrasound parameters, portal vein diameter, presence and size of collaterals, CT scan findings, ascites, platelet counts, coagulation parameters, albumin levels, Von Willebrand factor, bilirubin levels, diabetes mellitus, and the use of beta-blocking agents in primary prophylaxis are potential predictive factors for EVB. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the various aspects that can influence the risk of bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.&#160;</p><p>However, it is important to note that some of the identified factors exhibit varying degrees of reliability and may be subject to limitations and biases, as highlighted in the discussion. The quality of the studies and the potential for bias in some cases warrant caution in interpreting these findings. Further research is needed to refine and validate these predictive factors, taking into consideration the potential limitations of the existing studies. In addition, it is essential to acknowledge that the complex interplay of factors and the diversity of patient populations may influence the predictive capabilities of these factors. Therefore, a more tailored and individualized approach to risk assessment for EVB is necessary, accounting for specific patient characteristics and clinical context.&#160;</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#160; Ernesto Calderon Martinez, Maria D.
