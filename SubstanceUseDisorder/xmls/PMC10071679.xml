No symptoms such as chest pain, chest tightness, fever, loss of weight or shivering were observed. On July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018, she presented to our hospital. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) results showed as follows (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A): (a) mass soft tissue density shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, abnormal increase of fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism, indicating peripheral lung cancer; (b) multiple metastases in lower lobes of both lungs; and (c) multiple lymph node enlargement and metastasis in cervical root of both lungs, hilum of right lung and mediastinum. Cranial enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed scattered ischemic foci in bilateral subfrontal cortex. CT-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy of the right lung suggested lung adenocarcinoma (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), accompanied by increase of tumor markers, including cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21-1, 17.03&#160;ng/ml), carbohydrate antigen 12&#8211;5 (CA12-5, 143.14 U/ml), carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA, 188.42&#160;ng/ml) (Figure) and CA 19&#8211;9 (931.46 U/ml) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Then, next-generation sequencing (NGS), which covers exon regions of 550 cancer-related genes, was performed on DNA derived from the tumor biopsy specimen. Meanwhile, Pemetrexed disodium (0.4&#160;g VD on day 1) for one cycle was initiated on July 21th, 2018. Then she was treated with Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Pemetrexed disodium&#8201;+&#8201;Carboplatin for 5 cycles based on NGS results [HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations (p.Y772-A775dupYNMA) and TP53 p.G226D], with mutation abundance of 4.32% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). After treatment, decreased white blood cells and platelet counts (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, B) and partial response to the combined chemotherapy and targeted therapy were noticed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) view (July 12th, 2018) of the whole body. <bold>B</bold> CT-guided core needle biopsy (July 16th, 2018) suggested lung adenocarcinoma. <bold>C</bold> HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation (p.Y772-A775dupYNMA) abundance in plasma. <bold>D</bold> The curve of carcinoma embryonic antigen after treatment</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="13019_2023_2181_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The curves of <bold>A</bold> white blood cell count and <bold>B</bold> platelet count after treatment. <bold>C</bold> Chest CT results (October 8th, 2018) showed that the mass image of the right lower lung was reduced, indicating partial response to Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Pemetrexed disodium&#8201;+&#8201;Carboplatin. <bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold> Chest CT results (December 27th, 2018 and April 1st, 2019) showed enlarged bilateral lung lesions, with no significant changes in lymph nodes</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="13019_2023_2181_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">However, the continuous combination therapy resulted in enlargement of bilateral lung lesions and values of tumor markers. Further elevated tumor marker values were found after the treatment with Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Albumin-bound Paclitaxel. Therefore, Trastuzumab (400&#160;mg) and Nedaplatin (60&#160;mg) were added. Re-examination results (December 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018) indicated that values of tumor markers reduced, suggesting that the combined therapy was effective. Whereas, the treatment was delayed for 1&#160;week due to the development of myelosuppression (grade 3). Subsequently, Albumin-bound Paclitaxel was discontinued, followed by 4 cycles of Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Trastuzumab&#8201;+&#8201;Nedaplatin q3w, one cycle of Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Trastuzumab, and one cycle of Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Trastuzumab&#8201;+&#8201;Pertuzumab for continuation maintenance therapy. The re-examination of chest CT indicated that bilateral lung lesions were significantly smaller than before (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). MRI of the whole spine showed degeneration of the whole spine, and endplate inflammation was considered (stage II).</p><p id="Par9">Since February 16th, 2019, the patient was treated with Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Trastuzumab&#8201;+&#8201;Nedaplatin. Due to the slow progress of the disease treatment, with HER2 mutation abundance of 0.87% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D, 2E), she was treated with Poziotinib 16&#160;mg for 4 cycles. During treatment, the patient progressed from an initial stabilization of the right lower lung and reduced left clavicular lymph nodes to progressed left lung lesion, with no lesion in the skull. She also had severe paronychia and oral ulcers. On December 12th, 2019, the patient received Pyrotinib&#8201;+&#8201;Nivolumab for one cycle, followed by the addition of Anlotinib (12&#160;mg) for another 2 cycles. Re-examination results of December 19th, 2019 showed larger double lung lesions and formation of bone metastases, suggesting progressive disease (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). She was treated with Pyrotinib&#8201;+&#8201;Anlotinib for 1 cycle, and Thymus facin (Ridaxian) for injection was used for anti-bone metastasis. On May 10, 2020, the double lung nodules were increased and enlarged, and cavities appeared in some nodules, indicating progressive disease (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B); and peripheral blood NGS showed HER2 mutation p.Y772-A775dupYNMA with a frequency of 16.81%, accompanied by MDM2 copy number increase and TMB-L. Thus, the therapy changed to Trastuzumab&#8201;+&#8201;Pertuzumab&#8201;+&#8201;Bevacizumab&#8201;+&#8201;Nedaplatin for 2 cycles.

Due to myelosuppression (grade 3), the treatment regimen was adjusted to DS-8201 250&#160;mg once every three weeks. Imaging data indicated partial response to DS-8201and tumor marker values decreased significantly, suggesting good efficacy. Nevertheless, DS-8201 was discontinued because of decreased platelet and white blood cell counts. Meanwhile, she was admitted to the hospital for transfusion of platelet therapy, altribopa, recombinant human thrombogenietin injection, Avattribopa maleate tablet, pegylated recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factor needle and other treatments. The patient resumed the treatment of DS-8201 from October 7th, 2020 to April 16th, 2021, and the imaging results showed that partial response to DS-8201 and tumor marker values decreased significantly. Finally, she stopped taking DS-8201 due to the reduction of platelet and white blood cell counts.

In our case, HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations (p.Y772-A775dupYNMA) was detected in the plasma by using NGS. Previous study has revealed that patients harboring HER2 mutations often have various sites of metastases, the most common of which are lung, followed by adrenal metastases, bone and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Likewise, the patient in this study experienced multiple metastases in lower lobes of both lungs.</p><p id="Par12">Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for HER2-mutant subjects with advanced lung cancer and particularly pemetrexed-containing regimens is the most effective therapy for lung adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the current study, our patient was first given Pemetrexed disodium, followed by the addition of Bevacizumab and Carboplatin based on the NGS results. HER2-targeted therapy is known to improve clinical outcomes in HER2-positive breast, colorectal and gastric cancers. Also, responses to poziotinib, Bevacizumab, Pertuzumab, Anlotinib and pyrotinib in cancer patients with activating HER2 mutations have been reported in many clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, case series of chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab achieved a 50% response rate in lung cancer patients with HER2-activating mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, the patient in this study received chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and the effects were not satisfactory such as increased tumor markers or enlarged double lung lesions. This indicates that the optimal HER2 therapy for a specific HER2 molecular target has yet to be determined clinically.</p><p id="Par13">Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates have emerged as a potent cancer treatment strategy that combines the ability of monoclonal antibody to specifically target tumor cells with the highly potent lethal capability of agents with payloads too toxic for systemic administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. T-DM1, an HER2 antibody&#8211;drug conjugate, has been shown to significantly improve survival in HER2-mutang lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In our case, due to slow progress of the disease treatment, the patient received TDM-1. Nevertheless, the frequency of HER2 mutation was increased by 16.81%, accompanied by enhanced and enlarged bilateral pulmonary nodules. Following treatment with DS-8201, the imaging data indicated partial response to DS-8201 and tumor marker values significantly reduced, revealing good efficacy. DS-8201 is a novel HER2-targeted antibody&#8211;drug conjugate incorporating a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which has anti-cancer efficacy in clinical trials and anti-tumor immunity in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The phase 2 clinical trail of Li et al. have supported the clinical benefit of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC, while 49% of patients had drug-related grade 3 or higher adverse events which must be carefully monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Tamura et al. have clarified that DS-8201 exerts preliminary activity in T-DM1-pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Meanwhile, they also noticed that all patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, with anemia in 17%, neutropenia in 14%, leukopenia in 9%, and thrombocytopenia in 8%. Our patient stopped taking DS-8201 because of grade 3 myelosuppression (decreased platelet and white blood cell), which was consistent with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In this study, HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation (p.Y772-A775dupYNMA) is found in the lung adenocarcinomas patient and displays a partial response to DS-8201.
