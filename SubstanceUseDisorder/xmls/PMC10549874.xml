In addition to negatively impacting staff health and job performance, colonoscopy-related musculoskeletal disorder injuries may also signal potential risks to patient safety. To assess the prevalence of staff injury and perceived patient harm relating to the use of manual pressure and repositioning techniques during colonoscopy, 185 attendees of a recent national meeting of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates were asked to recall experiencing injuries to themselves or observing injuries to other staff or patients during colonoscopy.

A key mediating factor in this relationship is the occupational safety of nurses; turnover is higher in units where nurses experience higher rates of occupational injury (e.g., <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Charney &amp; Schirmer, 2007</xref>). Nursing consistently ranks at or near the top of professions by rate of occupational injuries (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Occupational Safety and Health Administration, n.d.</xref>). The most common type of injuries are musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), defined as musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases and disorders caused by actions such as bending, reaching, twisting; overexertion, or repetitive motion; examples include sprains, strains, and tears, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and hernia (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Dressner &amp; Kissinger, 2018</xref>). Among hospital personnel, MSDs are largely caused by repeated manual patient handling activities including transferring, repositioning, and lifting patients (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Occupational Safety and Health Administration, n.d.</xref>). MSDs are associated with high costs to employers such as absenteeism; lost productivity; and increased healthcare, disability, and worker's compensation costs. Aggregate costs associated with work-related strains and sprains among U.S. healthcare workers are approximately $2 billion each year (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Harris, 2013</xref>).</p><p>MSDs occur at a similar or greater rate among endoscopy nurses and technicians compared with their counterparts in other subspecialities, which are partly attributable to typical patient handling duties that include applying manual abdominal pressure and repositioning patients during colonoscopy (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale, 2011</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These techniques are primarily used to address looping, a common procedural difficulty; manual pressure is deployed in approximately 60% of all colonoscopies, whereas repositioning is used in approximately 40% of procedures (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Hansel, Prechel, Horn, Crowell, &amp; DiBaise, 2009</xref>). Each task requires substantial physical exertion and endurance, especially when performed on larger or heavier patients or when manual pressure is required for a long duration. This can result in back, shoulder, or hand and wrist MSDs; one assessment estimated that the force required to apply manual pressure to the abdomen of a 260-lb patient can exceed 100 lb (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Osborne, 2021</xref>). In a recent randomized controlled trial, sustaining manual pressure for more than 3 minutes was the strongest predictor of postcolonoscopy staff-reported musculoskeletal pain; this effect was magnified when patient body mass index was greater than 30 or patient waist circumference exceeded 45 inches (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Crockett, Dellon, Biggers, &amp; Ernst, 2021</xref>). In a study of 215 endoscopy nursing staff in the United States, 21% of participants missed work due to MSDs, 45% visited a doctor for work-related injuries, and 14% of respondents had undergone surgery for their injuries; similar injury and treatment patterns exist among Canadian endoscopy nursing staff (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Drysdale, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Further, manual pressure and repositioning are both indirectly and directly associated with patient complications from colonoscopy. Indirectly, manual techniques are used to address looping; looping is associated with complications that range in severity from minor postprocedural pain to colonic perforation (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sherid, Samo, &amp; Sulaim, 2013</xref>). A 2016 study found that the strongest predictor of postcolonoscopy patient pain was use of manual pressure; patients who received manual pressure were more than twice as likely to report moderate-to-severe postprocedure pain (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, emerging literature suggests that manual techniques may also pose risks to patients in their own right, which include bruising, skin tears, and splenic injury (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Osborne, 2021</xref>). While rare, serious complications attributed directly to manual abdominal pressure, including a mesenteric tear and an abdominal wall hematoma requiring hospitalization, have been noted in two recently published case reports (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Dixon, McDonough, &amp; Fang, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Osborne, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Shacket, Gillis, &amp; Guthrie, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The exposure of endoscopy staff to workplace injury during colonoscopy may also have broader ramifications for patient safety. Numerous studies show a relationship between patient outcomes and workplace injury among nurses, mediated by such factors as staffing ratios, scheduling, and workplace culture (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Charney &amp; Schirmer, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Copanitsanou, Fotos, &amp; Brokalaki, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hahtela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Lin &amp; Liang, 2007</xref>; Taylor, 2021). Even the <italic toggle="yes">perceived</italic> risk of injury, whether merited or not, may increase nurse turnover and thus impact patient outcomes (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hayward, Bungay, Wolff, &amp; MacDonald, 2016</xref>). As such, it is important to understand how nurses and other endoscopy staff understand the physical risks of everyday job tasks, as well as their awareness of institutional measures taken to reduce the risk of occupational injury. The primary aim of the current study was to measure the perceived incidence of staff MSDs and patient complications among endoscopy nurses; as a secondary aim, this study examined the associations between these observations and institutional ergonomic policies.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A seven-question, cross-sectional online survey was developed to explore the extent to which endoscopy nurses and technicians attribute a link between manual techniques used in colonoscopy (i.e., repositioning and abdominal pressure), occupational injuries, and patient complications following colonoscopy. Participants were asked to identify their organizational role (as either nurse, nurse manager, technician, or other staff), whether they had primary responsibility for repositioning patients during colonoscopy, their observations of colonoscopy-related injury among staff and patients, and whether an ergonomics policy relevant to colonoscopy procedures was in place at their institution (see the Supplemental Digital Content Appendix, available at: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/GNJ/A94" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/GNJ/A94</ext-link>).</p><p>Participants were recruited from attendees at the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates 48th Annual Course meetings, which were conducted virtually in May 2021.

Data were collected for marketing purposes by ColoWrap, LLC, and obtained by the researchers in de-identified form through a data use agreement.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to assess the frequency of observed colonoscopy-related injury among staff and patients, types of patient injuries observed, and incidence of institutional ergonomics policies.

The findings here suggest that manual techniques commonly employed during colonoscopy may have widespread negative impacts on the staff who perform them, and that patient harm associated with these techniques may be underrecognized.</p><sec><title>Staff Injury</title><p>Almost 90% of respondents who apply manual pressure indicated that they have suffered one or more MSDs within the past 12 months that they attribute to this task. Healthcare workers leave their jobs for a variety of reasons, but work-related injuries may needlessly abbreviate what would otherwise be lengthy and fulfilling careers. Workplace injury may increase the likelihood that more experienced nurses will exit more physically demanding specialties and switch to less physically demanding positions (e.g., advanced practice or teaching); further, nurses who reported work-related disability or experienced extreme physical demands are more likely than their counterparts to leave nursing altogether (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Mazurenko, Gupte, &amp; Shan, 2015</xref>). The fact that MSDs are one of the most common reasons for nurses leaving their position should be of particular interest to gastrointestinal physicians, whose ability to perform high-quality colonoscopy and maintain procedure volumes depends on the availability of experienced, well-trained staff. Likewise, hospital administrators tasked with hiring and retaining quality personnel should take note, particularly during a period where staffing shortages are expected to increase in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Falatah, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient Outcomes</title><p>The data suggest that, in the recollections of endoscopy nurses and staff, there is a credible relationship between the use of manual pressure and repositioning during colonoscopy and the likelihood of patient complications such as postprocedural pain. Although postprocedural abdominal pain is typically only a minor complication, it is also the primary cause of patient visits to the emergency department (ED) following colonoscopy, and may require a full CT workup to rule out more serious complications such as intestinal perforation (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Makker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Ranasinghe et al., 2016</xref>). The average cost per postcolonoscopy ED visit is estimated at $6,732, and increasingly these visits are not reimbursed by payers. Respondents' attribution of postprocedural pain from the use of manual repositioning and pressure are in line with findings from previous case reviews and observational studies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Makker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Sato, Fujinuma, &amp; Sakai, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sherid et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether these techniques contribute to patients returning to the ED following colonoscopy. In addition, although splenic injuries are reported as very rare in the literature, these injuries may be underreported, as 4.8% of participants in the survey indicating having observed patient splenic injury, which they attributed to manual pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Institutional Costs</title><p>Both staff harm and patient harm also impose institutional costs. With regard to the former, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration estimates the direct cost of work-related MSDs at approximately $15,600, with indirect costs (e.g., productivity loss, replacement employee hiring and training) of 4&#8211;10 times higher (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2011</xref>). Regarding the latter, even relatively minor patient complications from routine procedures such as colonoscopies may reduce patient satisfaction, which in turn increases the likelihood that patients may negatively review the practitioners and hospitals who treat them, delay or defer future colonoscopies, and/or seek further treatment elsewhere. One recent estimate of comprehensive costs and benefits for implementing a device to prevent MSDs in colonoscopies had a cost&#8211;benefit ratio of 1:4.35 and a resulting return on investment of 435% (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">James &amp; Hathorn, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the relationship between the adoption of ergonomic policies and observations of patient injuries is counterintuitive&#8212;namely, that respondents from institutions with ergonomics policies reported having observed patient injuries <italic toggle="yes">more</italic> frequently than their counterparts from other institutions. Although these findings fall just short of the threshold for statistical significance, they nevertheless warrant further consideration on both conceptual and methodological grounds. One possibility is that the ergonomics policies themselves may have a detrimental effect on patient safety during colonoscopy, which would suggest that ergonomics policies may have the effect of transferring risk of injury from staff to patients. However, this explanation seems unlikely given that reports of staff injuries are virtually identical across institutions with and without ergonomic policies. A more plausible explanation is that the presence of ergonomics policies may have the effect of heightening staff awareness of patient injuries relating to colonoscopy&#8212;in other words, making staff more likely to attribute patient injury to manual pressure and repositioning. This interpretation seems more in keeping with the corresponding lack of variation in reports of staff injuries between institutions that do and do not have reported ergonomics policies; relative to patient injuries, another staff member's injuries may simply be more noticeable, insofar as the latter is more likely to have immediate and palpable effects on one's own schedule and work duties.</p></sec><sec><title>Recommendations</title><p>In a recent position statement, the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates highlight the contribution of manual handling duties to workplace MSDs in gastroenterology nurses and technicians, and urges institutions to develop comprehensive strategies to ensure ergonomically safe workplace environments. In particular, the statement identifies a need to &#8220;eliminate manual handling activities&#8221; wherever feasible, provide safe patient handling education, and increase the use of assistive devices that reduce physical stressors on personnel (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, Inc., 2020</xref>). Our analysis underscores the need to evaluate the uses (and limitations) of manual pressure and repositioning in colonoscopy as part of institutional ergonomic assessments. Given the potential harm to endoscopy staff and patients, there is a clear need for broader education and training to minimize risks associated with the application of abdominal pressure and patient repositioning during colonoscopy. Training in basic principles such as &#8220;endoscope looping&#8221; as well as training in awareness of ergonomics and potential solutions to prevent injury should be provided to staff. Techniques and devices that minimize the need for manual pressure and repositioning should be included. Looping is a common reason for the use of manual techniques, and yet previous studies have shown that even experienced physicians may have difficulty in locating the precise looping configuration and site, leading to inaccurate manual pressure placement. Therefore, the use of magnetic imaging may be beneficial in both increasing the accuracy and decreasing the incidence of manual pressure application (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Holme et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Shah, Saunders, Brooker, &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>). More recently, abdominal compression devices designed for colonoscopy have been shown to improve colonoscopy success rates while reducing the need for manual pressure and repositioning during colonoscopy, as well as reduce the rate of MSDs among endoscopy staff (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Crockett et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hamade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nishizawa, Suzuki, Higuchi, Ebinuma, &amp; Toyoshima, 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The survey data presented here capture the experiences and perceptions of endoscopy staff, which are derived from&#8212;but may not always accurately reflect&#8212;clinical realities. Respondents may not have perfect recollection of the events surrounding observed injuries to colleagues or patient complications that they attribute to manual pressure and repositioning; further, recollections may be mediated by other factors such as the respondent's level of experience, procedure volume, institution-specific reporting protocols, and overall job satisfaction. Additionally, the self-reported injury data do not include information about the specific types, severity, or duration of MSDs suffered by respondents. Anecdotally, most MSDs associated with manual pressure are repetitive in nature (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder or back sprain/strain). In fact, the incremental nature of MSDs sustained while supporting colonoscopy may make the associated risks less apparent in day-to-day practice, and thus less likely to be addressed.</p><p>Another important limitation of the current study is that the sample does not fully represent the population of endoscopy staff; in particular, nurses and nurse managers are the bulk of respondents, whereas endoscopy technicians and assistants are underrepresented. Previous studies indicate that although colonoscopy procedures pose occupational hazards for all involved, the nature and severity of injuries is dependent upon one's role during the procedure. Further, just as patient injury may be functionally related to injuries suffered by staff performing manual pressure and repositioning, so too may the injuries sustained by nurses performing manual pressure be functionally related to the injury risks associated with endoscopic techniques.</p><p>Finally, as suggested previously, both patient injuries and institutional policies may be underreported here, as both are likely to be affected by the respondent's role within their institution and level of managerial responsibility. Institutional ergonomic policies may be underreported by nonmanagerial staff, who are the bulk of the respondents. Relatedly, as awareness of institutional ergonomics policies relating to manual colonoscopy maneuvers may increase awareness of patient injury due to colonoscopy, these findings suggest that the latter may also be underreported by respondents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the frequency and significant impact of MSDs associated with manual pressure and repositioning among endoscopy nurses and technicians, there is a clear need for interventions to minimize these risks for both staff and patients. MSDs among endoscopy staff may be an important predictor of both turnover rates and the likelihood of patient complications, which in turn substantially impact both physicians (who rely upon the availability of experienced staff) and administrators (who must limit institutional exposure to the financial risks of staff and patient injury). This study highlights the need to increase both implementation and awareness of workplace safety standards and ergonomic policies in endoscopy practices, which may reduce the incidence of injury not only among staff but also among colonoscopy patients. Raising awareness of the problem, implementing safety and ergonomic protocols, educating physicians and staff, and allocating appropriate funds to support these measures may help reduce endoscopy staff injury and the negative effects on patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="gastnu-46-386-s001.docx" id="d64e690" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Bridget Costello and Tamara James have received honoraria from ColoWrap, LLC.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental digital content is available for this article.
