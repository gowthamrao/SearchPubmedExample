Nevertheless, while RHIs and TBI might be considered candidate risk factors for dementia in contact sport athletes, there remain many other potential dementia risk factors that have yet to be explored in these populations.</p><p>The Lancet Commission on Dementia, Intervention, and Care identified 12 potentially modifiable general health and lifestyle risk factors for dementia,<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> among which is history of TBI. Together, these 12 risk factors are suggested to be responsible for up to 40% of dementia in the community, raising the prospect that targeted intervention directed toward addressing these risk factors might produce a considerable reduction in the burden of disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Regarding former contact sport athletes, there remain relatively few and conflicting data on these wider risk factors, with no data on their contribution to dementia risk. For example, among former professional soccer players, mortality from cardiovascular disease<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and lung cancer<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> is reported as low, suggesting better cardiometabolic health and lower rates of smoking, both potentially favoring lower dementia risk. In contrast, former professional American football players are reported to have higher hypertension and diabetes rates than general population estimates<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and higher cardiovascular mortality than non&#8211;contact sport athletes.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> There is, therefore, a need to better understand the contribution of these wider dementia risk factors to dementia among at-risk contact sport athlete populations to inform appropriate risk-mitigation strategies.</p><p>Soccer is the most popular participation sport worldwide, with over one-quarter of a billion active participants across more than 200 countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Studies of former professional soccer players reported high dementia risk in comparison with general population data<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and provided limited insights suggesting that former soccer players may have better outcomes in measures of general health.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In this context, we hypothesized that rates of many general health and lifestyle risk factors for dementia would be lower among former soccer players than among matched general population controls and, furthermore, that the contribution of these wider risk factors to risk of dementia among former soccer players would be less than among matched controls.

In our current analysis, we included former soccer players aged 30 years or older at study inclusion, with data censored at December 31, 2020. The present, larger study population, therefore, included participants from our group&#8217;s earlier reports.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Notably, dementia risk observed in the current and previous retrospective cohort studies of Scottish former soccer players<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> is in line with data on standardized mortality rates among French former professional soccer players<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and self-reporting of dementia in a cross-sectional study of English former professional soccer players.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> As such, there are now several studies using varying methods and in geographically distinct populations corroborating a 3- to 3.5-fold increased dementia risk among former professional soccer players compared with general population data.</p><p>Regarding the factors associated with the observed dementia risk among former contact sport athletes, our group previously found that risk among former soccer players was associated with player position and length of playing career, with outfield positions and longest playing careers being associated with highest dementia risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Elsewhere, higher self-reported estimates of heading frequency have been reported to be associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment among former soccer players.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, multiple autopsy studies of former contact sport athletes, including former soccer players, reported the frequent finding of a specific neurodegenerative pathology, chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change, intimately associated with prior exposure to TBI and RHIs.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Taken together, these parallel observations are interpreted as evidence that a sport-associated factor (specifically, exposure to TBI or RHIs) may contribute to dementia risk. However, multiple other factors are known to be associated with dementia risk, including potentially modifiable lifestyle and general health risk factors for dementia.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care cited 12 potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia, including TBI.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> NHS Scotland&#8217;s electronic health records provide data suitable for insight into 7 of these 12 risk factors. Compared with matched general population controls, the former professional soccer players in this study had similar if not lower rates of these risk factors. In other words, in wider health and lifestyle measures, the former soccer players generally were healthier with respect to potentially modifiable dementia risk factors. Furthermore, the contribution of these risk factors to observed dementia rates among soccer players in this study was less than among matched controls. These findings are broadly in line with research demonstrating lifelong general health benefits of high levels of physical activity associated with participation in sports at an elite level.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Nevertheless, despite the demonstrable general health and lifestyle benefits observed among the former professional soccer players in this study, which conceivably might be expected to be associated with lower dementia risk, our data showed high dementia risk in this population.</p><p>Because of the observed association between contact sports and lifelong brain health outcomes, specifically neurodegenerative disease risk, there are several initiatives across sports to act to mitigate risk when practical. As such, with evidence to date suggesting that this disease risk is associated with exposure to a sport-associated factor, specifically TBI or RHIs, there are ongoing efforts to reduce unnecessary exposure to RHIs and TBI and better recognize and manage sport-associated TBI when it occurs.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi241385r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In addition to these primary prevention measures, there are various initiatives intended as secondary prevention to mitigate dementia risk in former athletes. Initiatives, such as Brain Health Scotland, have been set up in an attempt to detect early signs of neurodegenerative disease and work alongside individuals of all ages to develop their own dementia prevention plans through lifestyle alterations.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> One challenge presented by the current data might be that in the context of generally better dementia risk profiles with respect to wider health and lifestyle factors, advice on risk mitigation based on data gathered in research and clinical practice in general, nonathlete populations may have less relevance to these former contact sport athletes. Future research should seek to identify tests that detect earliest indices of evolving neurodegeneration prior to clinical disease presentation in contact sport athletes, allowing for timely interventions to reduce dementia risk or delay onset of the disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In the interim, continued interventions directed toward risk mitigation addressing recognized, potentially modifiable risk factors should continue.</p><sec id="H2-7-ZOI241385"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A strength of this work is inclusion of a large, comprehensive cohort comprising 11&#8201;984 male former professional soccer players, each matched with 3 population controls on age, sex, and socioeconomic status. By matching for area socioeconomic status, we controlled for potential biases attributable to access to the NHS and limited private health care in Scotland. Furthermore, our analyses comparing dementia risk associated with various wider health and lifestyle factors among former professional soccer players to some extent addresses the potential confounder of healthy worker bias.</p><p>This study also has limitations. Our analyses lacked certain variables that are purported risk factors for dementia. Pollution data for this cohort were unavailable. Pollution (typically indexed by fine particulate matter of 2.5) is fundamentally complex to analyze; a single cross-sectional snapshot (eg, home postcode) is unlikely to give an accurate estimate of an individual&#8217;s average lifetime exposure. Consideration of multiple key confounders (eg, time spent outdoors, proximity to roads, or pollution at the workplace) is important.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Thus, in this context, pollution was not a practical exposure to consider. We did not consider the potential association of educational attainment in this cohort. While lower educational attainment is a recognized potential factor associated with dementia,<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> inclusion of educational attainment as a covariate in exposure and outcome associations often makes relatively little difference to estimates.<sup><xref rid="zoi241385r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> It is also important to note that this study did not include information on individuals managed exclusively in a primary care setting. In an ideal study setting, information regarding health outcomes managed in a primary care setting would also be available. Nevertheless, we have no reason to expect systematic bias to one group or another in the level of health care accessed for the outcomes assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI241385"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cohort study, compared with matched general population controls, our data showed former professional soccer players had similar or lower risk of multiple common, potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Specifically, rates of hypertension, diabetes, depression, hearing loss, obesity, smoking, and alcohol-related disorders were lower among former soccer players than among their matched controls. The findings suggest that while interventions to address general health and lifestyle risk factors remain recommended, the priority for neurodegenerative disease risk mitigation among contact sport athletes should continue to be reduction, if not removal, of exposure to RHIs and TBI when practical.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI241385"><title>References</title><ref
