We collected the data from 10,000 participants who responded to the demographics survey on enrollment between November 14, 2019 and May 20, 2020. The participants were asked to complete a monthly follow-up through November 2020. The eligibility included installed Apple Research app on their iPhone with iOS version 13.2 or later, were living in the United States, being of age greater than 18 years (19 in Alabama and Nebraska, 21 years old in Puerto Rico), were comfortable in communicating in written and spoken English, were the sole user of an iCloud account or iPhone, and were willing to provide consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RESULTS:</title><p id="P5">The mean age at enrollment was 33.6 years old (&#177;standard deviation, 10.3).

The participant geographic distribution included all the US states and Puerto Rico. Seventy-two percent (7223/10,000) reported the use of an Apple Watch, and 24.4% (2438/10,000) consented to sensor-based data collection. For this cohort, 38% (3490/9238) did not respond to the Monthly Survey: Menstrual Update after enrollment. At the 6-month follow-up, there was a 35% (3099/8972) response rate to the Monthly Survey: Menstrual Update. 82.7% (8266/10,000) of the initial cohort and 95.1% (2948/3099) of the participants who responded to month 6 of the Monthly Survey: Menstrual Update tracked at least 1 menstrual cycle via HealthKit. The participants tracked their menstrual bleeding days for an average of 4.44 (25%&#8211;75%; range, 3&#8211;6) calendar months during the study period.

Common factors include stress, nutrition and body weight, physical activity, and combination lifestyle factors. Furthermore, menstrual cycle function is an indicator of health and longevity.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> For example, bone density is built and maintained in the presence of cyclic ovarian function.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Fertility, terminal breast differentiation, and aspects of cognition and memory are also influenced by menstrual status and function.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The endocrine pathways involved in menstrual cycle physiology include the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and a healthy functioning of the thyroid and adrenal glands; the anatomic structures necessary include the uterus, endometrium, and ovaries.</p><p id="P8">Furthermore, irregular patterns or the absence of menstrual cycles can serve as indicators of underlying health problems. The presence of irregular menstrual cycles may indicate hormonal disturbances, including thyroid disorders, prolactinomas, systemic illness (including cancers), anatomic pathology such as uterine fibroids, polyps, or adenomyosis; it has also has been linked to an increase in all-cause mortality.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Abnormalities in the bleeding length and amount affect up to 30% of those who menstruate.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The existing data on the menstrual cycle characteristics, including the normal distributions of the cycle length and bleeding days, are based on prior and well-designed but demographically-limited cohorts.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Little is known about how these conditions vary across subpopulations or how they relate to future health conditions.

Once the research teams had completed the initial drafting of the baseline survey, it was reviewed by Apple, Inc. to conform to their design standards across the 3 studies.</p><p id="P11">The interface for the Research app was designed to be intuitive and simple. The research profile completed at enrollment is common to all 3 studies and includes the initial demographic survey. To implement the intuitive and simple survey concept, the baseline women&#8217;s health study survey was split across the initial year of the study to distribute the participant burden over time as noted in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. The health history survey was given at month 4, and the reproductive history was given at month 10. The Monthly Survey: Menstrual Update (MSMU) was initiated after the first completed month of enrollment and then monthly thereafter. The time to survey completion was estimated in 5-minute increments on the basis of usability testing by Apple, Inc. The response time for the enrollment processes (screening, eligibility, demographics) was estimated to be 25 minutes. The expected response times as listed in the Research app for monthly surveys such as the MSMU, Pregnancy Update, and Lactation Update were 5 minutes each.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Apple research app platform</title><p id="P12">The study is hosted within the Apple Research app (available on the Apple App Store), which allows a participant to find, enroll, and participate in Apple-supported, health-related research studies.</p><p id="P13">The Research app was designed with 3 studies for a simultaneous launch, where the demographics and certain questions were standardized across the studies.

The response categories for the baseline Menstrual Status Survey included currently menstruating, lactating, menopausal, and pregnant. For the remaining months within the first year of follow-up, the participants were given monthly surveys to provide a menstrual status update, pregnancy update, and/or a lactation update. Health surveys were given quarterly to assess the changes in sleep, physical activity, nutrition, stress, alcohol use, tobacco use, electronic nicotine use, and marijuana use within the previous calendar month. Reproductive history was assessed at the tenth month (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).

The purpose of the MSMU is to give additional context for the logged menstrual bleeding days and associated symptom logging in HealthKit. The MSMU is given to those who have previously indicated the capacity to currently menstruate on the baseline survey; it is not given to those who have indicated current pregnancy, menopause, or to those who are no longer menstruating. The MSMU is delivered within the Research app on the first Sunday of every month, starting in month 2 of participation, at least 4 weeks after enrollment. The survey is available for 1 week after delivery and then expires and is no longer available to the participant. Programming logic was applied in the analysis phase as follows: the monthly surveys were counted when the participants responded at least 4 weeks after enrollment. Any monthly survey with participant responses before 4 weeks of enrollment was excluded from this count.

We have initiated the retention efforts utilizing education, communication, and engagement through a study update feature within the app and on the study website to promote monthly survey completion. To ensure continued diversity in this cohort, care must be taken to both recruit and retain the population through effective engagement strategies. Furthermore, engagement strategies may be constructed to limit the loss to follow-up of certain subpopulations. Further evaluation of the data must be conducted to understand whether nonrandom dropout may bias the longitudinal effect estimates on the basis of the monthly surveys, though the menstrual data that is tracked will be written to HealthKit, and it will limit missingness and avoid reliance on survey responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P52">The AWHS captures time-varying demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral data that are built into the Research app, an app that interfaces with multiple data sources.
