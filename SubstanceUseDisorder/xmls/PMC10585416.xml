Preliminary evidence suggests positive outcomes for patients initiating buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Additional work is needed to examine outcomes for individuals who initiated telemedicine early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is particularly important for the HCS because the pandemic led to changes in access to care shortly before the start of the study intervention. The purpose of this study is to examine how the telemedicine regulatory changes implemented under the COVID-19 public health emergency were associated with buprenorphine treatment of OUD and whether telemedicine-associated buprenorphine initiation was associated with patient outcomes such as retention in treatment or nonfatal overdose.</p><p>This study examined the use of telemedicine for OUD care immediately prior to a buprenorphine prescription, including initial prescriptions, using 2020 data from Medicaid beneficiaries in 2 HCS states, Kentucky and Ohio. We describe general trends in the frequency of buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine, including the proportion of individuals receiving any buprenorphine via telemedicine from one quarter to the next, and analyze initiations of buprenorphine via telemedicine. We also model the association between telemedicine buprenorphine initiation and 2 outcomes: treatment retention and opioid-related nonfatal overdose. If telemedicine were associated with poorer treatment outcomes, we would expect telemedicine initiation to be associated with decreased retention and increased opioid overdose risk.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-ZOI231073"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-ZOI231073"><title>Data Source</title><p>Kentucky and Ohio Medicaid claims and enrollment data from November 1, 2019, through December 31, 2020, were used to construct the analytic data set.

In fact, patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine were more likely to be retained in treatment than those without telemedicine initiation. These results are consistent with pre&#8211;COVID-19 studies reporting better retention when telemedicine visits were included in care.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> They are also consistent with recent studies examining Veterans Health Administration<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and Medicare<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> populations. In the present study, telemedicine initiation was more common among individuals with behavioral health claims in the months prior to initiation. This finding may be associated with clinicians reporting hesitancy around initiating unfamiliar patients using telemedicine,<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> or it could reflect some unmeasured aspect of clinician decision-making. For example, some clinicians may be uncomfortable with using telemedicine specifically for buprenorphine treatment of OUD due to regulatory barriers and complexity,<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and pandemic-related efforts to improve telemedicine access may have been challenging to interpret, particularly as telemedicine policies evolved later in the pandemic. In 2021, for example, Kentucky&#8217;s Board of Medical Licensure issued an opinion that acknowledged the utility of telemedicine for buprenorphine treatment while also expressing that this modality &#8220;is not appropriate for satisfying the standards of all components of a treatment program, particularly in regard to monitoring components.&#8221;<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> State legislation enacted at the end of 2021 in Ohio defined clinicians who may provide telemedicine services and removed the requirement of an in-person visit for patients receiving MOUD. Laws such as this may bolster clinicians&#8217; confidence in the effectiveness of telemedicine for substance use treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>These results offer important insights for states with a high burden of OUD looking to policies and methods to reduce barriers to treatment. The HCS selected states with high rates of opioid-related overdose (Kentucky, Ohio, New York, and Massachusetts). As telemedicine increased with the start of the pandemic, the HCS team began reviewing the use of telemedicine MOUD initiation to understand the association of the policy changes with the study outcomes. Our results show that telemedicine was associated with increased access to MOUD and improved retention. This finding may be especially valuable for improving MOUD access in states such as Kentucky, which has historically had restrictive buprenorphine access policies<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and restrictive methadone regulations, as well as a large rural population.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Telemedicine may also increase access in underserved areas, adding to the workforce for behavioral health services in rural areas. In the present study, however, rural Ohio residents were less likely to initiate buprenorphine with telemedicine, and rural residents in both states had better patient outcomes. The association between urbanization and MOUD outcomes varies across states,<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and there may be heterogeneity in the association of telemedicine with rural buprenorphine access.</p><p>Our results also provide insights about sustaining telemedicine care for MOUD after the pandemic emergency regulations end. The declaration of the national public health emergency allowed federal and state regulation changes to support increased access to MOUD and telemedicine buprenorphine initiation. Beyond regulation changes, reimbursement issues are key factors limiting telemedicine expansion. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued guidance allowing states to provide reimbursement parity for telemedicine services compared with in-person services. Most states (n&#8201;=&#8201;42) approved Medicaid parity requirements for general telemedicine visits, but only 17 approved these requirements for mental health visits, and fewer states approved commercial insurance parity requirements.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Although telemedicine visits may be more convenient, bypassing the need to take time off or find transportation to receive treatment, payers are reluctant to provide parity if telemedicine is viewed as inferior to in-person care or is associated with potential harms. Our findings provide some support for parity requirements by demonstrating that telemedicine was associated with improved access and improved treatment retention.</p><sec id="H2-10-ZOI231073"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to our analysis. For example, there may have been unmeasured confounders, such as perceived patient stability, that influenced our findings. Follow-up studies using causal inference or examining patient and clinician experiences and preferences would be valuable for understanding who is offered telemedicine during buprenorphine initiation. Given the changes in telemedicine policies and infrastructure in the years after 2020,<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> it will be important for future studies to examine whether telemedicine initiation was associated with better retention beyond 2020. Similarly, the results from the present study may not be generalizable beyond the Medicaid populations in Kentucky and Ohio. We required continuous enrollment in Medicaid, which may have biased the sample away from negative outcomes by excluding incarcerated individuals and those who died. In addition, the continuous enrollment requirement would have affected individuals differently starting in March 2020 because Medicaid agencies paused unenrollment based on eligibility during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Because Medicaid data were not linked to emergency services or death records, this study considered only medically treated overdose. Overdose was a rare outcome, and so the power to detect an association between telemedicine and overdose may have been limited. Estimated associations with telemedicine may also have been biased toward the null if changing billing guidelines led to the misclassification of telemedicine services. Finally, we did not distinguish between different models of telemedicine (eg, telephone and video), and some groups may have had less access to technology used in real-time video telemedicine. Telephone-only telemedicine may be associated with lower odds of retention compared with video telemedicine, and non-Hispanic Black individuals may have lower use of video telemedicine.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Future work examining audio-only vs audiovisual telemedicine will be valuable because audio-only telemedicine may be more accessible, but it is unclear whether evolving regulations around reimbursement parity will also lead to parity for audio-only care.<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI231073"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Mitigation strategies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic placed an additional burden on individuals seeking care for OUD. Telemedicine provided a way to initiate and/or continue OUD treatment with buprenorphine. In this cohort study, we examined how telemedicine regulatory changes implemented under the COVID-19 public health emergency were associated with buprenorphine initiation, buprenorphine retention, and management of OUD. The number of individuals receiving buprenorphine for treatment of OUD increased throughout 2020. The proportion of buprenorphine prescriptions supported by telemedicine increased and then decreased, stabilizing above prepandemic levels. Individuals using telemedicine initiation were more likely to achieve 90-day retention with buprenorphine. Opioid-related nonfatal overdose was not associated with telemedicine initiation. Our results suggest that telemedicine is a strategy associated with increased access to MOUD and improved retention. We did not find any association between telemedicine and nonfatal overdose, although additional work is needed to examine whether this finding would apply to individuals other than continuously enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries in Kentucky and Ohio. This work addresses important questions around the growing interest in continuing the use of telemedicine to support treatment and management of OUD after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends<sup><xref rid="zoi231073r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231073r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and provides insights into the utility of telemedicine to improve patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI231073"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi231073r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Cortez</surname><given-names>C</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Mansour</surname><given-names>O</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Qato</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Stafford</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Alexander</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Changes in short-term, long-term, and preventive care delivery in US office-based and telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic</article-title>. <source>JAMA Health Forum</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>2</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<elocation-id>e211529</elocation-id>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.1529</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">35977211</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC8796900</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231073r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Akre</surname><given-names>S</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>COVID-19 and the drug overdose crisis: uncovering the deadliest months in the United States, January&#8211;July 2020</article-title>. <source>Am J Public Health</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>111</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>1284</fpage>-<lpage>1291</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2105/AJPH.2021.306256</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33856885</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC8493145</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi231073r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>Ohio Department of Health</collab></person-group>.
