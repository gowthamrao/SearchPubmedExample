A diverse set of base models was trained to predict a binary outcome constructed from reported suicide, suicide attempt, and overdose diagnoses with varying choices of study design and prediction methodology. Each model used twenty cross-sectional and 190 longitudinal variables observed in eight time intervals covering 7.5 years prior to the time of prediction. Ensembles of seven base models were created and fine-tuned with ten variables expected to change with study design and outcome definition in order to predict suicide and combined outcome in a prospective cohort.

The relatively low absolute incidence of death by suicide in the US population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, approximately 14.0/100,000 population per year or 1&#8211;2% of all US deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, amplifies these difficulties. Even with a favorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, the majority of patients identified as high-risk do not go on to die by suicide. These issues lead to models with poor predictive value and thus can create a significant, potentially unsustainable, clinical burden. We hope to enable quantitative analysis of strategies to reach deeper into the risk pool by exploring the use of combined outcomes and facilitating the sub-grouping of patients for whom interventions could be more-specifically targeted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

ReachVet is based on the extensive EMRs available in the VA, and was designed to intervene specifically for veterans predicted to be in the top 0.1% of risk for suicide at each of the 150 VA medical centers. A recent program evaluation found this intervention to be associated with greater treatment engagement and fewer mental health admissions, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts, but not with a reduction in suicides or all-cause mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this work, we build from these pioneering studies, which provide both a rich set of hand-curated variables and an overall workflow developed through years of operational use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We expanded the time dependence of our predictor variables and introduced new input variables for vital signs and common laboratory metrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as well as census data from the American Community Survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> matched to patients by zip code.

We then present the biological drivers of the combined outcome as captured by the coefficients from the Rcc logistic regression base model and calibration plots for important patient subgroups, noting that our ensemble models successfully reproduce both the strong effect of healthcare utilization on the model score for the combined outcome and the much smaller dependence when predicting suicide. We then characterize the dependence of selected variables on age and the confounding effect of the level of healthcare utilization and compare the relative risk for suicide and suicide attempt outcomes of subgroups defined by each predictor variable.

Below this histogram are diagrams describing our retrospective nested case-control (Rcc) and prospective cohort study designs. We see that the number of modeled outcomes increases from 2812 suicides and 24,446 combined outcomes in a prospective two-year (C17) cohort to 31,371 suicides and 260,579 combined outcomes in our retrospective case&#8211;control (Rcc) study. Because we used the same longitudinal data pattern of eight time bins prior to the time of prediction across all cohorts and both outcomes, we can predict across both models and outcomes. In this way, we aim to combine the mechanistic insights of Rcc with the operational need to compute suicide risk in a prospective cohort.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Three important aspects of study design for suicide prediction.

Many important variables, such as emergency department visit (PoC_ED), opioid use disorder (OUD), metastatic cancer (EH_METCANCR), and being married, have similar coefficients in the two models, and correspond to plausible risk factors. Also evident are large differences for variables expected to be strongly dependent on study design and exclusion criteria, such as suicide attempts, suicide ideation, and overdoses, with the latter provided in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>. Another reason for the differences in coefficients is the greater statistical power of the Rcc model (260,579 cases in Rcc vs. 22,446 cases in C17, from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); indeed, the number of model selected predictor variables for the Rcc cohort was almost double the number for the C17 cohort.

Because of this, in the top panel of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we compared c-statistic scores on our C17 cohort after performing a transfer learning process where we fine-tuned each of our base models (Rcc, Cox-MH, Cox-Visit, or C15) with a logistic regression optimization including the ten variables named in the bottom panel of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. This process was done for both the combined outcome and suicide.

Hence, we next created two ensemble models from the eight base models (seven in each ensemble), EnsNDI for suicide (excluding C15 All), and EnsAll for the combined outcome (excluding C15 NDI) and fine-tuned them as described above for scoring the base models. This resulted in a 1 percentage point improvement over any of the base models for both outcomes, as shown in the right-most bar at the top of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and improved model calibration, described below.<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Attributes of ensemble models: (top) C-statistic scores for eight base models and our ensemble models, fine-tuned for both the combined (red bars) and suicide (blue bars) outcomes, all evaluated for the C17 cohort.

We see that approximately half of the weight to the EnsNDI model came from the C15 model, and half from the combinations of non-linear Rcc-trained models. Also evident in this figure, the Cox models did not contribute much in either ensemble model, despite having relatively high c-statistics (see top panel of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The relatively large coefficients for overdose and suicide ideation and attempt are consistent with their strong dependence on study design, as discussed in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. It is important to realize that the base model scores have roughly five times the range of the other ten variables when interpreting Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, because the ensemble model score has a broader range than the binary (0/1) predictor variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Model coefficients</title><p id="Par13">The VA EMR dataset boasts sufficient statistical power for LASSO model selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> of hundreds of time-dependent predictor variables.

The clearest difference between study designs, already visible in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, is the reliance of the prospective cohorts on fewer variables, and those that tend to be indicators of outcome, rather than indicative of particular pathways to these outcomes.

The Rcc constrains more variables both because of the greater number of cases and because acute information is available for all of the cases. Cox-MH constrains fewer variables, presumably because of the lower contrast between cases and controls when all cases and controls have a behavioral health diagnosis code. Training on suicide as an outcome drops the number of surviving predictor variables to 51 in the C17 cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Model calibration</title><p id="Par17">Calibration curves in subgroups complement c-statistics in assessing model performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

Also, our model distinguishes cases from controls throughout the risk spectrum, showing an increasing positive predictive value in the high-risk tail of the risk distribution, most readily seen with the logarithmic scale. Overdoses are the most poorly predicted component in three of the four models, as indicated by CoR. This could be because overdoses have very different predictors than suicide attempts or because our combined outcome definition assigns patients with both suicide attempts and overdoses to the suicide attempt category.</p><p id="Par26">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b compares four model training strategies in predicting C17 cohort outcomes. The first model comparison shows that EnsAll identifies 614 patients attempting suicide out of the 1090 patients in the top 0.1% risk in the down-sampled sub-cohort, corresponding to a 20% positive predictive value (PPV) for our combined outcome across the active VA patient population. When optimizing the ensemble model to identify NDI-reported suicide, the most important metric for the ReachVet program, EnsNDI identified 29 suicides in the top 0.1% risk strata, shown in the third row from the bottom of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, or a PPV of 1% in the original C17 prospective cohort. In addition to our EnsNDI and EnsAll models, the table provides results for models trained on suicides (C15-NDI and C17-NDI) before fine-tuning on C17. These two models correspond to two logical ways of making prospective cohort predictions. The C15-NDI model is trained on the most recent two-year period for which data are available in time to prospectively evaluate on the C17 NDI cohort. The C17-NDI column split the C17 cohort into even and odd date of birth cohorts, training on each half while evaluating on the other, then reporting the sum (or the average, for the rates) result in the table. Both prospectively trained models were less sensitive than the EnsNDI model at predicting suicide within the high-risk strata, with the C15 model performing more poorly than C17, even though C17 was effectively trained on only half of the data. This speaks to a lack of model generalizability across time or model drift.</p><p id="Par27">In Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, we assess this two-year time drift more carefully&#8212;taking advantage of a holdout set of NDI-reported suicides for 2019 and 2020 and made available to us after the development of all of the above-presented models. The top group of numbers provides a baseline performance of twelve models predicting two-year suicide risk from January 1, 2017. The first four models were trained directly on two-year suicide risk in the C17 cohort, then fine-tuned with the ten (time-independent) variables shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. For all linear models (GLM, Cox, and all fine-tuning) two models were trained (even and odd cohorts as training) and the average of model coefficients was used as the final model. For non-linear models, the model trained on odd cohorts was used to evaluate all data. We note that the non-linear NDI-prospectively trained models were seen to be overfit during training, with the NNet model not converging (and so not shown), the RF strongly overfit, and the TabNet model simply performing poorly. The GLM model performed best, but its LASSO model selection down-selected to 51 variables, compared to 607 for the GLM combined outcome model. The naive Bayes model was not overfit but also performed relatively poorly. Training on the combined outcome and fine-tuning to the NDI-suicide outcome provided better performance than direct training on NDI outcomes (where the fine-tuning was somewhat superfluous), with the non-linear models consistently outperforming the linear models. As noted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the EnsNDI model performance is two percentage points better than any of the component models.</p><p id="Par28">The bottom set of numbers in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c evaluate how the models trained without ever seeing the NDI-suicide data after January 1, 2019 perform on two-year suicide prediction from that date (C19 cohort). We observe first that the NB, RF, and TabNet models trained directly on the C17 NDI-suicide outcome perform much worse on the C19 data, with 6&#8211;8 percentage point decreases in c-statistic. The rest of the models, including EnsNDI, dropped by 1&#8211;2 percentage points, with the linear models losing less than the non-linear ones. It should be noted that three of the eight time bins of the predictor variables moved from ICD-9 to ICD10-coded variables in moving from C17 to C19 outcomes. To assess whether the decrease in performance was due to the base-model training or fine-tuning, the middle set of numbers kept the 2017 predictions but enabled fine-tuning on 2019 data. We see that the updated fine-tuning improved neither EnsNDI nor base model performance. Perhaps surprisingly, updating the fine-tuning appears to have decreased the ability of most base models to identify the top 0.1% suicide risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">We find that study design, variable definition, prediction methodology, model characterization, and identification of cases in a prospective cohort are intertwined, with choices made in one aspect impacting another. Our workflow utilized the observation, explained in detail by Ernster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, that retrospective nested case&#8211;control (our Rcc) and case-cohort (our C17) cohorts are well-suited for identifying biological drivers of outcome and predicting cases in a prospective population, respectively. Although primarily motivated by efficiency in sampling patients, she also noted that matching can alleviate the impacts of confounding variables and push the model toward more mechanistic and generalizable models, while maintaining a well-defined relationship to a cohort facilitates comparison across analyses. Ensemble transfer learning exploits these designs in several ways. First, the Rcc cohort is structured to maximize statistical power in training non-linear models, and is matched in order to minimize the role of age and healthcare utilization in the Rcc model. Second, ensemble learning provides a systematic way to identify and leverage the ML models with differing choices in outcome variable definitions. Third, because both Rcc and C17 models are derived from the same initial cohort, the transfer learning has a simpler task in fine-tuning the predictive model from Rcc to C17; the variables that need to be fine-tuned are those involved in matching in Rcc (age and level of healthcare utilization), those changing with outcome definition, and other outlying data points in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, such as demographics.</p><p id="Par30">While the above arguments should seem plausible, any ML-based workflow should be considered heuristic and be carefully characterized for discrimination and calibration in important subgroups defined by demographics, potentially confounded variables, risk strata, important indicators, risk factors, treatments, and sub-components of the outcome.

Second, one could lump together patients from often-misidentified outcomes to establish need, then subgroup based on the type of need. We expect that a single, non-linear model that is robust against the multitude of complex variables will outperform stratified or separate models by making more effective use of the limited number of cases observed for suicide as an outcome.</p><p id="Par32">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> provides a rich overview of logistic regression coefficients, developed on a date of birth- and age-matched Rcc model predicting on 961,423 controls and a combined outcome with 31,371 suicides, 136,351 first reported suicide attempts, and 92,857 first reported overdoses.

Critical to our effort is extensive calibration analysis in a wide variety of subgroups, evaluation of accuracy metrics in prospective cohorts nested into the cohort of all active VA patients, and comparison of risk factors emerging from our matched Rcc cohort to those obtained from literature.</p><p id="Par35">We illustrate the difficulty of comparing models across reported studies with a few recent examples. Alemi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> report a c-statistic of 0.77 for predicting &#8217;suicide or intentional self-harm&#8217; from a cohort of veterans similar to our own. When we applied the naive Bayes methodology that they used to our C17 cohort, we obtained a c-statistic 0.741 for predicting our combined outcome and 0.665 for predicting NDI suicides. This is well below our EnsAll model performance of 0.83, highlighting the caution needed to avoid conflating a serious and rare outcome with a less-serious and more common outcome, as explained in Pocock et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Two articles examining ninety-day suicide risk in non-veteran cohorts with similar size and available predictor variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> provide another useful comparison. In broad terms, their list of important predictor variables is similar, highlighting in particular the value of PHQ9 scores. Their reported c-statistic for predicting ninety day suicide risk, based on a cohort with 1240 cases, is 0.833, much larger than our value of 0.714 for two-year risk derived from a data set with 31,371 cases in our Rcc cohort. These values cannot be directly compared, however, for several reasons. First, their choice to predict across patient-visits rather than patients creates a more unbalanced data set, which directly affects the c-statistic, as explained by Cook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It also biases the sample towards patients who visit more frequently, thus having more extensive medical records, providing a stronger basis for identification. Finally, their process of randomizing training and test sets across visits, particularly the highly-correlated multiple visits in the ninety days before a reported suicide, may strongly impact the generalizability of their model. While generalizability to independent healthcare systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> is a reasonable standard for general adoption of a medical outcomes model, which historically has been problematic for predictive models of suicide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, both Justice <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and Ernster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> suggest prospective validation in an easily defined (nested) cohort as a valuable intermediate step to assess the value of models predicting medical outcomes.</p><p id="Par36">In terms of the clinical implications of our study, we have not changed the underlying facts that suicide is relatively rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> with a broad array of non-clinical drivers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and risk factors that are difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> or very difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> to quantify. We have, however, provided in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> a set of self-consistent, time-resolved, linear risk factors for our combined outcome, together with a discussion of how predictor variables differ in their relative risk of suicide and suicide attempt, in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b. One feature evident in these risk factors is epidemiological support for the role of vascular damage and hypoxia in suicide and suicide-related behavior, which has support in the literature, discussed in the Supplementary Discussion section, along with the other risk factors. Another feature is the importance of indicators of suicide, such as the answer to question 9 of the PHQ-9 survey and diagnoses for suicide ideation, suicide attempts, or visits to the emergency department. While the linear risk associated with indicators presented here are unlikely to generalize well to other populations (this is the nature of indicators), they are indicative of what is possible. If PHQ-9 surveys are not regularly given or suicide ideation not diagnosed, this evidence suggests they may be of significant value. Also, we have provided a model, based substantially on non-linear drivers of suicide described in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, that predicts suicide better than models based entirely on demographics and indicators and is well-calibrated for many important subgroups of patients, such as those defined by age, gender, and healthcare utilization. This provides a path forward to reaching deeper into the risk pool and identifying patient subgroups who may be well-suited to particular interventions, as suggested by Pisani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and Sorter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Finally, we have provided a rich baseline model from which we can evaluate the utility of novel predictors of suicide and suicidal behavior, such as genetic markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> or thought markers, described in Pestian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">This study suffers from many important limitations. Primary among these are missingness of information and difficulty in quantifying the diverse drivers of suicide-related behavior. We have primarily relied on structured clinical data from the VA EMRs, and not utilized Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data, service records from the Department of Defense, Veteran&#8217;s Benefits Administration, or specialized databases on veteran suicide. Additionally, we have not utilized clinical notes, which would require natural language processing, or genetic information in our analysis. While the diverse trajectories leading to suicide suggest the need for diverse predictors, our broad base of information, explicit treatment of data missingness, and the existence of studies suggesting minimal impacts on mortality prediction when adding Medicare claims data to VA EMRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> suggest our results can serve as a firm baseline for predicting suicide.</p><p id="Par38">Our cohort was composed of US Veterans who are adults, 90% male, and have a median age of 65 years, (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), and so the pathways towards suicide may not generalize to other populations. Our study has utilized only representative ML predictive models, with a focus on simpler and more generally understood methods, to more clearly elucidate the interplay between study design, ensemble transfer learning, and model performance. It appears likely that more elaborate base models will further improve model prediction accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">We present predictive models of suicide and a combined outcome of suicide, suicide attempt, and overdose that use 190 longitudinal and 20 cross-sectional hand-curated variables. To identify mechanistic predictors of our outcome, we use a retrospective nested case-control (Rcc) study design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> to predict our combined outcome on 260,579 cases and 961,423 controls matched on date of birth and overall health care utilization, with variables defined retrospectively from the date of the event. This creates enough statistical power for LASSO model selection to identify a broad range of risk factors involving demographics, vital signs, laboratory results, PHQ surveys, a wide range of medical diagnoses, medications, and behavioral health treatments.</p><p id="Par40">We found that the application of ensemble transfer learning techniques combined several nonlinear models using our Rcc cohort with prospective cohort models to yield predictions with c-statistics of 0.73 for predicting suicide and 0.82 for predicting our combined outcome, and were well calibrated across a wide variety of subgroups. EnsNDI outperformed the base models in placing NDI-reported suicides in the top 0.1% of risk, and suffered a two percentage point drop in c-statistic with two-years of model drift. The number of patients identified at the top 0.1% risk strata for two-year risk suggests a 1% positive predictive value (PPP) for suicides in the active VA patient population using our EnsNDI model and 20% PPV for our combined outcome using our EnsAll model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par41">The VA EMRs contain multimodal data for 24 million patients, so we created a workflow that supported iterative steps of pulling and linking the data from the patient database, defining the study cohorts, defining the variables, encoding the variables, training the predictive models, creating the ensemble models and fine-tuning, and finally the evaluation and visualization of results. Two R scripts and one Python script are provided in the Supplementary Materials that were used to perform all of these analyses. To facilitate the analysis, the data were pulled from the patient database into 100 cohorts of 240,000 patients each, sorted according to their date of birth. All patients with a birth date on or after January 01, 1901, and one or more visit recorded after June 30, 2007, was considered in our studies.

Likewise, the time of prediction was set to 45 days (fixed gap) before the outcome date to ensure that there was no outcome information leakage in the predictor variables. This creates one of several arbitrary choices associated with the Rcc study design: including patients with suicide attempts and overdoses before this cutoff will enable suicide attempts to predict suicide attempts across this boundary, while this will not occur after 2007 because the outcome is defined as the first instance of a suicide attempt outcome. Ultimately, this problem is resolved here by including suicide attempts and overdoses in the fine-tuning process and evaluating accuracy scores only on prospective cohorts that have been fine-tuned. Similarly, the time of prediction for the prospective cohorts (C15, C17, and C19) was set to be Jan 01, 2015, Jan 01, 2017, and Jan 01, 2019, respectively. To ensure no outcome information leakage, we excluded the outcome in the first week after the time of prediction. A shorter gap was used than for Rcc because most events are more than several week after the time of prediction, and we wanted to keep as many events as possible, for statistical power.</p><p id="Par44">Definition of cases for our combined outcome was done as follows: if there was a death by suicide in the allowed time window, then this was used as the outcome. If not, the outcome was defined as the first recorded suicide attempt within the allowed window. If there was no documentation of suicide or suicide attempt, then the first recorded instance of an overdose in the window was used as the outcome. This heuristic enables the model to learn the predictive values of death by suicide, suicide attempt, and overdose while utilizing all recorded suicides and not repeatedly counting patients with multiple events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Treatment of outcome variables</title><p id="Par45">Suicide provides a binary outcome and cannot recur, so is straightforward to use as an outcome for each of our models. Our motivation to combine suicide attempts and overdoses with suicide is partly the relatively low incidence of suicide, but also the ambiguity surrounding the cause of death and ascertaining intent for potentially suicidal behavior. Additionally, this study&#8217;s goal of comparing study designs and transfer learning is greatly facilitated by creating a binary variable. Hence, we enrich in more serious events (prioritizing suicide, then suicide attempts, then overdoses), and as a secondary criterion, choose first-recorded events after the time of prediction over subsequent events.</p><p id="Par46">Constructing our combined outcome by prioritizing suicide, then suicide attempts, and then overdoses creates side effects in how suicide attempts and overdoses appear as predictor variables in the different study designs. The calendar-based cohorts (C15, C17, and C19) are the most straightforward, where any suicide attempt and overdose before the time of prediction can be used as a predictor variable to predict the combined outcome obtained as described above. Our matched, nested, retrospective, case-control (Rcc) study design shows the strongest effect, where our use of first-recorded component outcome (in accord with the rules described above) to define the time of prediction, from Aug 16, 2007 means that while overdoses will still predict both suicide attempts and suicide, and suicide attempts will predict suicides, very few suicide attempt will predict other suicide attempts and very few overdose will predict another overdose.</p><p id="Par47">The event-driven time-to-event (Cox) models are intermediate, where the time of prediction is triggered by either a psychiatric evaluation (Cox-MH) or an office visit (Cox-Visit). Since the first such visit in a three-year window starting from July 1, 2007 is used, this study design also has the potential to skew the presence of predictor variables. This complex interplay of suicide attempts and overdoses as predictor variables is rooted in the distinct study designs of Rcc and prospective cohort studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This dependence motivated their inclusion in our transfer learning process where we utilize knowledge learned from all the other cohorts to improve learning and prediction in our C17/9 cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study cohorts</title><p id="Par48">We analyzed 24,558,158 distinct patients from the VA electronic medical records (EMRs), with a date of birth on or after January 01, 1901. Our study was focused on patients with the outcomes of interest, including death by suicide (as recorded in the National Death Index or NDI), suicide attempt, or overdose (the latter two based on diagnosis codes). The top panel of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows histograms of the first occurrences (since there can be more than one suicide attempt or overdose for a given patient) of individual components of the combined outcome vs. time for all cases between January 2000 and December 2021.</p><p id="Par49">Five study cohorts were used in this work as characterized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. First is a retrospective case-control (Rcc) cohort that is defined by time-dependent variables in the indicated windows before an outcome event (cases) or a randomly selected diagnosis code (control). For each case, four control patients were chosen by randomly selecting medical visits among patients without an outcome event, but over the same period as the outcome date for the cases, and then selecting one visit for each of the four chosen controls. The controls were chosen from the same date-of-birth cohort as the cases to ensure that cases and controls have roughly the same age distribution and their randomly selected medical visit was treated as their &#8217;outcome date&#8217;. This allows people with more medical visits to be preferentially chosen as controls, which both balances cases and controls on the overall level of healthcare utilization and selects an outcome time for controls corresponding to a period of healthcare utilization. Matching of variables in a case-control study design is a well-established procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> which is often motivated by modeling of rare events, but can also help in mitigation of confounded variables and those with strong, non-biological, interaction terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Matching can also introduce biases and becomes progressively more complex as the number of matched variables increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Consequently, we chose to match on only two of the most important confounding and interacting variables, healthcare utilization (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and age (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) and do so with simple algorithms.</p><p id="Par50">In addition to Rcc, we used several prospective cohorts. Time to event (Cox) models were constructed for patients with a psychiatric evaluation (StopCode 502, Cox-MH) or office visits (StopCode 323, Cox-Visit) in the three years starting on July 1, 2007, with the time of prediction being the date of the psychiatric evaluation or office visit, respectively. For both of the time-to-event (Cox) models, the goal was to mimic a clinical decision point and compare the information content in these models to the other study designs. We chose a three-year window for the initiation event to allow a lengthy (ten year) follow-up period for patients. Time to event models were right-censored on deaths, but not on last visit to the VA, specifically to include patients who may have dropped out of care. In the end, Rcc provided a richer set of mechanistic predictors and interval prediction of prospective two-year risk provided a more flexible characterization of prospective risk, so relatively little analysis of these study designs occurred here. Finally, we used two prospective calendar-based cohorts for all patients with a recorded visit in the three-month period before the time of prediction, which is either January 01, 2015 (C15) or January 01, 2017 (C17). For each cohort, data were binned in the eight time periods, and the number of controls and cases for each sub-outcome are indicated. These cohorts capture different aspects of the study with the Rcc matched on age and overall level of healthcare utilization, and outcome events spread across 15 years and the prospective cohorts designed to accurately predict suicide risk in a prospective cohort.</p><p id="Par51">A gap between the time of prediction (which is the end of the observation period) and the event was incorporated to prevent inappropriate leakage of outcome-related information into the predictor variables. For the retrospective design (Rcc), the event (for cases and controls) could occur at any time between August 15, 2007, and January 1, 2022, and the gap between the time of prediction and the event is exactly 45 days. For prospective design (C15/17, Psych-ds, and Visit-ds) the gap was only seven days.</p><p id="Par52">The time bins in the observation period were organized identically for all study designs. They increased in width as they moved more distant (earlier) from the time of prediction, on a logarithmic scale in two periods of three months, two periods of six months, two periods of one year, and two periods of two years (see bottom of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was done to enable cross-prediction of models, whereby they are trained on one cohort (typically Rcc) and evaluated on another typically C17). The fine-tuning of the handful of variables involving demographics, overlapping with outcome definitions, and matching, enabled accuracy scores of Rcc-trained models to be competitive with prospectively-trained models, when predicting in prospective cohorts, as summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. As shown in this table, the Rcc cohort was used to train logistic regression, a fully connected neural network with three hidden layers, random forest, and TabNet models for the combined outcome. The Cox-MH and Cox-Visit cohorts were used to train Cox models for the combined outcome, and the C15 cohort was used to train two logistic regression models, one for the combined outcome and another for suicide. All the models were then individually fine-tuned on the training set of the C17 cohort and their c-statistic on the test set of the C17 cohort was reported. This process created base models, to be used in our ensemble transfer learning approach, discussed below in the Prediction Methodologies section.</p><p id="Par53">Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S1</xref> shows c-statistics for our base models, evaluated both the Rcc and C17 cohorts, before and after an early version of our fine-tuning procedure. Several results evident in this table were important in developing our EnsNDI and EnsAll models. In this table, the rows correspond to ten models trained on our combined outcome plus one C17 logistic regression model trained on two-year NDI suicide risk, while the columns refer to cohorts and outcomes (combined or NDI suicide) that each of the models was evaluated against. For each model/cohort pair, the top number is the accuracy score before fine-tuning and the bottom number after. For cases where c-statistics differed more than 0.2 percentage points between test and train cohorts, they are provided as train/test pairs. Important observations from this table include: Rcc models transfer to prospective cohorts much better than in the reverse direction. Combined outcomes can be predicted more accurately than suicides. Nonlinear models applied to prospective cohorts predicting NDI suicide are prone to overfitting. None of the base models performed as well as our ensemble models, defined in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and characterized through this work. The difficulty in training models of the dimensionality used here against prospective suicide risk is evident from: 1) the very low number of degrees of freedom (in &#8217;DoF&#8217; column), of 51, making it through LASSO model selection when training C17 for suicide outcome, 2) the 1 percentage point difference between test and train for the Rcc-trained models predicting on C17 NDI suicides, and 3) the significant difference between test and train accuracies evident for the non-linear models when evaluated against NDI suicide outcome after training prospectively on our combined outcome. If accuracy scores alone were used to assess models, fewer differences would be seen among models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Predictor variable definitions</title><p id="Par54">Once the date-of-birth cohorts were defined, we worked systematically across 42 specific tables, subsetting by date-of-birth cohort, linking to national patient identifiers, unique inpatient or outpatient visit identifiers, and standard ontologies for each data domain.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Variables from diagnosis codes</title><p id="Par55">The ReachVet program, administered by the VA OMHSP, has developed a list of hand-curated diagnosis codes, building on McCarthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

Pulse pressures between 30 and 50 mm Hg were not included, and used as a reference category in the logistic regression. Labs and vital signs were first carried forward (imputed) over time when missing, and if needed, values were then carried (imputed) backward.

Using 7.5 years of longitudinal EMR data for each patient, we applied these methods to the four study designs (Rcc, Psych-ds, Visit-ds, and C15/17 cohorts) discussed above.</p><p id="Par67">For random forest, we used 500 trees, the square root of the number of input features for the number of features to consider for the best split, and required a minimum of 100 samples at a leaf node.

These included the width of the decision prediction layer (8), the width of the attention embedding (8), the number of steps in the architecture (3), and gamma (1.3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Fine tuning and ensemble transfer learning</title><p id="Par68">To test the robustness and generalizability of the methods, we tested models trained on one study cohort to cross-predict on another cohort. For example, we used the logistic regression coefficients fitted on the Rcc study design to predict outcomes in all the prospective cohorts and calculated the corresponding c-statistics. We did this across all the prediction algorithms and study cohorts. Results of this analysis are presented in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. We then performed transfer learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> on a selected subset of these models (mostly trained on Rcc) for making use of the knowledge learned from one study cohort to facilitate learning in a different cohort. This is done by fine-tuning the models trained on Rcc or C15 cohorts on the C17 cohort to predict either suicide or the combined outcome, as described in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In keeping with the goals of fine-tuning, only a minimal number of variables were included, and these were selected to be ones expected to change with study design (eg matched variables or components closely related to outcome definition). Such variables will be well away from the diagonal in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. We found these variables to include gender, race, ethnicity, young or old, and recorded presence of chronic pain, suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and overdose during the 7.5 years of the observation period. The number of degrees of freedom fine-tuned was further restricted by aggregating the presence/absence across time bins such that presence in any time period counted as present. Additionally, we created one additional variable not directly used in the base models, to describe the aggregate level of healthcare utilization, which we constructed by summing across al 75 diagnosis-defined variables across all eight time bins, for a possible range of zero to 75 x 8 = 600. In practice this number rarely exceeds 100, so we scaled the coefficient presented at the far right in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> by 100 and labeled it &#8217;100 x usage&#8217;.</p><p id="Par69">Next, we used an ensemble transfer learning approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> to obtain our best model in terms of predictive performance and generalizability for our C17 cohort, with one model predicting suicide (EnsNDI) and another predicting our combined outcome (EnsAll). We used an ensemble of seven base models including the four models (logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and TabNet) trained on Rcc cohort, two Cox models trained on Psych-ds and Visit-ds cohorts, and one logistic regression model trained on the C17 cohort. This ensemble of base models was fine-tuned as described in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The code for performing the ensemble transfer learning appears from line 1340 to line 1425. Trained models are used to score the patients in C17 and the ten variables are created for fine-tuning by aggregating across all eight time bins. Even and odd cohorts are fit without model selection and resulting scores are computed on the half of C17 not trained on. These scores can then be used for model evaluation for EnsAll and EnsNDI models. This portion of the code also implements the C17 predictions for C15 and C17-trained models, again taking care to do all the training on even (or odd) cohorts so that reported calibration and discrimination results are on test sets of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Training and testing data sets</title><p id="Par70">All data sets used for training and evaluating base models and fine-tuning across a multitude of study designs, prediction methodologies, and outcomes were based on a separation of patients into 100 cohorts in order of date of birth, allowing us to use even and odd cohorts to separate test data from training data. For two-stage training, both trainings occurred on the same set (eg. even) of patients, leaving the other set (eg. odd) for evaluation. For all models except those reported in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c, reported accuracy scores are the average of those trained on even cohorts and evaluated on odd and vice-versa.

In this instance, we created our best-possible models of C17 suicide risk, with outcomes of suicides through the end of 2018 and combined outcomes through the end of 2021, shown in the top of Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. NDI-specific models were trained on two-year suicide risk during 2017 and 2018. We then examined the drift in performance of a dozen models in predicting the holdout NDI suicides occurring from Jan 1, 2019&#8211;Jan 1, 2021, under two sets of assumptions. In the first instance, we fine-tuned each of the models on a test set of the NDI suicide data, while in the second instance, we fine-tuned the models on two-year 2017 NDI suicides, using these coefficients in predicting 2019 suicides. This provided an independent evaluation of model generalizability, with the two years of model drift allowing more independence of training and test data than the separation into even and odd date of birth cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Evaluation of model performance</title><p id="Par72">Beyond such metrics as c-statistics and various accuracy metrics, there are no standard metrics for visualizing predictive model performance for medical outcomes analysis.

For the various calibration plots, histograms, and scatter plots that we made, much of the code is straightforward joining and subgrouping operations using the data table package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, and efforts were not made to modularize the code.

The goodness of fit for the Cox models is estimated by computing Harrell&#8217;s c-index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>.
