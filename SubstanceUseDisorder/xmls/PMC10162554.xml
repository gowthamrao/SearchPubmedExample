Twin studies indicate that this co-occurrence is likely due to shared elements of risk, rather than reciprocal causation. A joint genome-wide investigation and pathway/network-based analysis of adolescent anxiety and pain problems can identify genetic pathways that subserve shared etiopathogenetic mechanisms. Pathway-based analyses were performed in the independent samples of: The Quebec Newborn Twin Study (QNTS; 246 twin pairs and 321 parents), the Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Quebec (QLSCD; n = 754), and in the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample. Multiple suggestive associations (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>), and several enriched pathways were found after FDR correction for both phenotypes in the QNTS; many nominally-significant enriched pathways overlapped between pain problems and anxiety symptoms (uncorrected <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.05) and yielded results consistent with previous studies of pain or anxiety. The QLSCD and the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample yielded similar findings. We replicated an association between the pathway involved in the regulation of myotube differentiation (GO:0010830) and both pain and anxiety problems in the QLSDC and the combined QNTS and QLSCD sample. Although limited by sample size and thus power, these data provide an initial support to conjoint molecular investigations of adolescent pain and anxiety problems. Understanding the etiology underlying pain and anxiety co&#8208;occurrence in this age range is relevant to address the nature of comorbidity and its developmental pathways, and shape intervention. The replication across samples implies that these effects are reliable and possess external validity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008240</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#233;bec-Soci&#233;t&#233; et Culture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#233;bec - Sant&#233;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>R&#233;seau qu&#233;becois sur le suicide, les troubles de l&#8217;humeur et les troubles associ&#233;s</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000155</institution-id><institution>Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Canadian Institutes for Health Research</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Ste.

A population-based sample of 662 families of twins were initially enrolled in QNTS, and then assessed longitudinally at regular intervals.

The latest completed QNTS wave of assessment (age 19) yielded a cumulative attrition rate of 23% since the study&#8217;s inception, with 73% of remaining participants in complete pairs. The QNTS encompasses a broad range of physiological, cognitive, behavioral, school-, and health-related phenotypes collected prospectively and repeatedly with multi-informant and multimethod measures.

DNA was extracted from blood or saliva samples and prepared for genotyping using standard protocols. Genome-wide genotype data were generated using semi-custom chip based on Illumina&#174; PsychArray-24v1.1 Beadchip which is a cost-effective, high-density microarray developed in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for large-scale genetic studies focused on psychiatric predisposition and risk. The custom chip had an additional 790 SNPs selected based on prior knowledge that suggested the presence of association with psychological phenotypes and social behaviors.

Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of genome-wide genotype data was also used to identify any subjects that did not cluster together with the majority of the dataset, and these were discarded, as were any outliers for genome-wide heterozygosity. Furthermore, individuals were excluded based on inconsistent relationship status. Genotype phasing was conducted using SHAPEIT v2 (r837) [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

In particular, we sought to detect an excess of association signals within genes associated with various GO biological processes.</p><p>Overall, the pathway involved in the regulation of myotube differentiation (GO:0010830) was found to be associated with pain problems and anxiety symptoms in the QNTS (<xref rid="pone.0285263.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). This finding was replicated in the QLSDC (<xref rid="pone.0285263.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). Testing for association with independent discovery and replication samples is a well-known approach in molecular genetics, and was adopted here to corroborate results from the discovery sample and minimize type I error [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A similar pattern of results was found in the combined QNTS and QLSDC sample (<xref rid="pone.0285263.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref>). Among the significant candidate genes within this nominally-significant enriched pathway, some have been previously associated with pain problems and anxiety symptoms.

The <italic toggle="yes">HDAC5</italic> gene is characterized by histone deacetylase activity, and represses transcription when tethered to a promoter. The nociceptive hypersensitivity of this gene has been indicated in different pain models [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and its expression in the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in susceptibility/resilience to chronic stress [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and is altered by epigenetic processes linked to an interaction between isolated housing and social stress [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Moreover, the current findings integrate and expand actual knowledge by showing that the observed phenotypic co-occurrence between pain problems and anxiety symptoms is accounted for by a substantial overlap of genetic factors [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. By testing the genetic association with average scores of assessments collected through early adolescence, our results agreed with previous multivariate longitudinal twin studies demonstrating that genetic factors that are common to both phenotypes support the temporal stability between pain problems and anxiety symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We can therefore hypothesize that variation at the above-described pathways accounts for function at some intermediate phenotypes, which would act as latent factors underlying the co-occurrence between common and persistent pain and anxiety (internalising conditions). Quite compelling is the possible interplay of the biological systems of harm detection, such as the perception of pain or the detection of dyspnoea (a key mechanism of panic anxiety), in emotion-related brain networks [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This suggests that anxiety and pain may be linked together under the umbrella of altered interoception, an emerging field of investigation at the crossroads of mental and physical health [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Ultimately, these findings may help healthcare practitioners and policymakers better inform diagnostic reasoning, develop more effective standardized measurement tools as well as treatment interventions for pain and anxiety/depression (internalising conditions), and reduce the social and economic burden of these conditions.</p><p>The findings of this study need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, although this is the first exploratory molecular genetic study investigating the etiopathogenetic mechanisms subserving pain and anxiety in two independent, well-characterized longitudinal cohorts, the sample size was small for genome-wide studies. Moreover, small sample size did not allow us to stratify the analyses by sex. Although available twin adolescent data indicate a similar etiology of pain and anxiety for boys and girls [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285263.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], these remain quantitative genetic modeling applications, so that molecular genetic replications in larger datasets are needed. Second, a pre-spotted microarray containing candidate genes for psychiatric predisposition and risk has been genotyped. This may have limited the potential of the study since identification of pain-relevant candidate genes is dependent on the genes with overlapping phenotypes and therefore skews the observations. Third, as in most large-scale epidemiological studies of adolescent pain, self&#8208;report measures of anxiety and pain and the reliance on single informant data, were available. Fourth, our questionnaires lacked items addressing muscular-relevant observations. Fifth, although the QNTS and the QLSCD shared a high percentage of best-guess genotyped polymorphisms (about 80%), this led to a different number of genotyped polymorphisms between the two samples. Sixth, we average pain and anxiety items in the 12&#8211;14 years&#8217; age range into unitary mean scores of general pain and anxiety proclivity. Consequently, we cannot delineate whether temporal stability and longitudinal correlation between phenotypes is attributable to stable genetic influences over time, and we cannot apply our findings to specific pain types at particular body sites or to specific anxiety symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In addressing the biological bases of the co&#8208;occurrence between adolescent pain and anxiety, we aimed at better characterizing the nature of their comorbidity, their shared developmental pathways, and the bases for sounder intervention [<xref rid="pone.0285263.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

By showing potential shared genomic risk between pain problems and anxiety symptoms, these findings can inform diagnostic reasoning, guide clinical practice, and support the development of new medications.</p></sec><sec id="sec019" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0285263.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Descriptive statistics of the phenotype&#8217;s distribution in the QNTS and QLSCD cohorts.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0285263.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0285263.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Top associations (<italic toggle="yes">p-value</italic> &lt;

However, excess of association signals within the genes of the same biological process for both phenotypes were found. Several enriched pathways with nominally significant uncorrected p values were found for both cohorts. Several pathways/GO categories were shared between mean pain and anxiety score phenotypes.</p><p>The cohorts are well described, as well as, the scores for the anxiety and pain phenotypes. The genetic analysis with the genotyping, quality control and imputation are also clear, as well as, the pathway association analysis. The results described are in adequation with their observations. The introduction is short, the material and method section is clear, as well as, the results and discussion section.</p><p>I have a concern regarding the investigation of anxiety and pain in these cohorts. Evaluation of anxiety and pain between man and woman should be taking into account independently because the distribution of anxiety and pain is different between genders with an increase of anxiety and pain in girls than boys. Furthermore, this is also true and exacerbated for adolescents or young adult populations like the Quebec Newborn Twin Study and Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Quebec. How, the authors manage that? Why the authors did not investigate separately boys and girls?</p><p>Furthermore, for adolescent women, there is an increase of migraine and pain reported due to puberty and menstrual cycles. How the authors manage it for anxiety and pain phenotypes? This should also discuss in the paragraph of limitations.</p><p>Thus, it should be very important to have a specific investigation for girls only (and boy only) of this question of the genetic profile of anxiety and pain in adolescent.</p><p>Regarding the sample size of the two investigated cohorts, they are small. Thus, could you provide a computation of the statistical power of each of your cohort, and for the combination, for an expected significant genetic association with anxiety, pain and both? I guess this power is low and it will explain why the genome-wide association studies could not reach a significant threshold after multiple corrections.</p><p>Regarding Table 1, it is mentioned 41 pathways -page 8, line 183). However, in the table 1, there is only 37 GO set ID. Could you correct that sentence?</p><p>There is no figure of the genome-wide Manhattan plots for the two combined cohorts. This could be added in supplementary document.</p><p>Tables 1 to 3 are large and on several pages. Thus, I would move the table 3 in supplementary document.</p><p>In that state, the manuscript PONE-D-22-19260 submitted by Mascheretti and colleagues need some clarifications and answers to questions to be suitable for a publication in the journal PLOS One.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript entitled &#8220;Adolescent anxiety and pain problems: a joint, genome-wide investigation and pathway-based analysis&#8221;. Authors conducted a joint GWAS to get some meaningful findings. I have the following concerns.</p><p>1. It is well-known that anxiety and pain problems may be more prevalent in adult and old population than those in adolescent. However, this study used the adolescent population. Was the target population appropriate? Please state it.</p><p>2. It is crucial to identify MZ and DZ in twin study. How did the study identify the zygosity of the twin pairs?</p><p>3. How to avoid bias in the self-reported questionnaire of pain and anxiety to ensure the accuracy of the study?</p><p>4. Did the study consider the age, sex, etc. as the covariates in the data analysis?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Furthermore, this is also true and exacerbated for adolescents or young adult populations like the Quebec Newborn Twin Study and Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Quebec. How, the authors manage that? Why the authors did not investigate separately boys and girls?</p><p>A: Our previous work with the QNTS (PMID: 31944483) showed that, while the frequencies of endorsement vary according to sex (and quite in agreement with the Reviewer&#8217;s expectation), models that imposed no sex constraints had no worse fit than models that imposed such constraints. The implication is that, regardless of different prevalence in the two sexes, the etiology (i.e., same genes) can be assumed as comparable for boys and girls.

Specifically, for frequent pain there was no symptom-by-sex interaction at any of the 5 longitudinal waves of assessment, which shows no significant variation between boys and girls for adolescent pain.

Thus, could you provide a computation of the statistical power of each of your cohort, and for the combination, for an expected significant genetic association with anxiety, pain and both? I guess this power is low and it will explain why the genome-wide association studies could not reach a significant threshold after multiple corrections.</p><p>A: We conducted post-hoc power calculations to estimate the smallest genome-wide significant association that our samples could detect with 80% statistical power (&#945;=5&#215;10-8).

Given that, it is not possible to generate a SNP Manhattan plot for the combined region similar to those provided in the Supplementary Figures. We better specified the methodological procedure as follows (page 10, lines 282-283):</p><p>&#8220;(&#8230;) we merged the genomic regions for which we found nominally significant results in both the QNTS and QLSCD to achieve stronger statistical power and thus test the robustness of the previous findings.

Authors conducted a joint GWAS to get some meaningful findings. I have the following concerns.</p><p>Authors: We really thank Reviewer 2 who expressed favorable comments and provided useful suggestions.</p><p>R: 1. It is well-known that anxiety and pain problems may be more prevalent in adult and old population than those in adolescent. However, this study used the adolescent population. Was the target population appropriate? Please state it.</p><p>A: Pain problems not caused by identified medical conditions begins early in life, are common among children and adolescents (between 8% and 12% of adolescents aged 11&#8211;17 years and 16%-20% of youths or young adults; PMID: 20971561; PMID: 31954722; PMID: 18093737; PMID: 34966130; PMID: 31944483), are associated with internalizing symptoms (PMID: 31944483; PMID: 26901806; PMID: 28267063; PMID: 23940244), persist into youth and adulthood (PMID: 15109969; PMID: 28267063; PMID: 20971561; PMID: 18093737), and are associated with negative long-term outcomes (PMID: 31651579). Accordingly, using adolescent population to understand the nature of the co-occurrence between common and persistent pain and internalizing conditions (anxiety/depression), is necessary to inform diagnostic reasoning, guide clinical practice, develop new medications, and help reducing opioid prescriptions and abuse. Adolescent anxiety and persistent pain likely constitute a gateway to premature, more prolonged, and more hazardous opioid prescription (PMID: 30681713; PMID: 29532067; PMID: 27028915). Inasmuch as a culture of risk identification has not yet entered into practice, and specific treatments for young people who present with both pain and anxiety are lacking, this type of research can prove valuable. We addressed this issue in the &#8220;Conclusions&#8221; paragraph (pages 14-15, lines 386-389):</p><p>&#8220;Pain problems not caused by identified medical conditions begins early in life, are common among adolescents [1, 4, 8, 30, 57], are associated with internalizing symptoms [4, 6, 58-59], persist into youth and adulthood [1, 57-58, 60], and are associated with negative long-term outcomes [61].&#8221;</p><p>We coherently added the following references:</p><p>[57] Stanford EA, Chambers CT, Biesanz JC, Chen E.

How to avoid bias in the self-reported questionnaire of pain and anxiety to ensure the accuracy of the study?</p><p>A: Previous studies using the same questionnaires implemented in this study reported acceptable level of internal consistency for the pain and anxiety scales. We have therefore revised the text as follows (page 4, lines 133-135 and page 5, lines 142-144): </p><p>&#8220;Across the longitudinal assessment waves, the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha indices of the pain items&#8217; cumulative scores (range: 0.71-0.74) and the anxiety symptoms mean scores (0.82-0.84) were acceptable [4]. (&#8230;) Average anxiety scores were then computed at each assessment time, with Cronbach alphas averaging 0.80 across measurements [23]&#8221;</p><p>We coherently added the following reference:</p><p>[23] Garmroudinezhad Rostami E, Touchette &#201;, Huynh N, Montplaisir J, Tremblay RE, Battaglia M, et al. High separation anxiety trajectory in early childhood is a risk factor for sleep bruxism at age 7. Sleep 2020; 43:zsz317. </p><p>R: 4. Did the study consider the age, sex, etc. as the covariates in the data analysis?</p><p>A: Age was not considered as covariate in our analysis because we addressed temporal stability of pain and anxiety symptoms by averaging scores across the different assessment waves. We addressed this issue in the Methods section (pages 4-5, lines 135-138 and page 5, lines 140-144)</p><p>&#8220;Because of the moderate-to-strong covariance of pain problems and anxiety symptoms across the 12, 13, and 14 assessment waves at age, suggesting temporal stability [4], we averaged these scores to obtain: a QNTS_Mean Pain, and a QNTS_Mean Anxiety index for each twin (S1 Table). (...) At age 12 and 13, each subject rated presence of headaches on a dichotomous (Yes/No) scale and 3 items for anxiety symptoms (i.e., &#8220;too fearful or anxious&#8221;, &#8220;worried&#8221; and &#8220;nervous, high-strung or tense&#8221;) on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (never occurs) to 2 (frequently occurs). Average anxiety scores were then computed at each assessment time, with Cronbach alphas averaging 0.80 across measurements [23]&#8221;</p><p>Regarding sex, our previous work with the QNTS (PMID: 31944483) showed that, while the frequencies of endorsement vary according to sex (and quite in agreement with the Reviewer&#8217;s expectation), models that imposed no sex constraints had no worse fit than models that imposed such constraints. The implication is that, regardless of different prevalence in the two sexes, the etiology (i.e., same genes) can be assumed as comparable for boys and girls.
