A systematic review, including more than 4 million individuals with type 2 diabetes, showed that CVD was responsible for 50.3% of all deaths globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Data from Australia estimated that 57% of people with diabetes have CVD, and nearly 65% of CVD-related deaths occur in people with prediabetes or diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Likewise, in Europe and Canada, and despite advances in CVD prevention and treatment, studies report persistent excess death associated with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Nonetheless, in the United States (US), a reduction in all-cause and CVD deaths was reported (23% and 40%) in people with diabetes between 1997 and 2006, suggesting improvement in CVD risk-factor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, in Australia, Harding et al. showed a significant decrease in all-cause and CVD deaths among Australians with type 2 diabetes between 1997 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also, the incidence of stroke remained stable from 2010 to 2019, while the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) decreased from 2012&#8211;2013 to 2018&#8211;2019 in Australians with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite these encouraging trends and efforts in expanding evidence-based guidelines for managing CVD in people with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], CVD prevalence in type 2 diabetes is a burden that is likely to persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

This study, however, analyzed the whole Australian population and did not provide insights into the excess CVD burden in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">As the majority of CVD deaths in Australia occur in people with prediabetes or diabetes, prevalence rates of CVD outcomes are required to forecast the societal burden of CVD in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we projected the health and economic burden of CVD among people with type 2 diabetes in Australia for each year from 2022 to 2031 using a dynamic multistate model, which allows for the movement of individuals into and out of the simulations and accounts for changes in mortality and migration as well as incident type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Model Structure and Description</title><p id="Par10">After reviewing prior published studies on the burden of CVD complications due to type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], a two-stage dynamic multistate Markov model was constructed using Microsoft Excel to predict the societal burden of CVD among Australians with type 2 diabetes using yearly cycles.</p><p id="Par11">The model covered a 10-year time horizon from 2022 to 2031, and the population of interest was people with type 2 diabetes aged 40&#8211;89 years, stratified according to age and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Here, the population with type 2 diabetes was allowed to enter the model at the age of 40 years, assuming that at 40 years old the risk of CVD increases among the Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and exits when they reach age 89 years, which nearly reflects the life expectancy in Australia (84.3 years in 2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Overall, the model followed individuals for 10 years, until they died or until they reached 89 years of age in the model.

Risk estimates were extracted from the National Health Survey (NHS) (2011&#8211;2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and were calculated based on sex, age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, diabetes status, hypertension treatment status, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The 2013 PCE-ASCVD has been validated, and showed better performance in Australians with type 2 diabetes compared to other CVD risk prediction tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The NHS included 4205 Australians, of which 313 had type 2 diabetes and were aged between 40 and 90 years. Characteristics of the Australian population included in the PCE-ASCVD to estimate the CVD risk for the type 2 diabetes without CVD population are described in ESM Table 5. The next step was to derive sex- and age-specific average 10-year risk scores and convert these scores to annual probabilities. Annual event rates were plotted against the midpoints of each 10-year age group, and polynomial functions were used to model the values for every year of age (ESM Table 6). The PCE-ASCVD algorithm only estimates composite CVD outcomes (fatal and non-fatal combined); thus, to estimate the proportions of fatal and non-fatal MI and stroke events among Australians, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This corresponded to 0.28 and 0.72 for fatal and non-fatal MI and 0.32 and 0.68 for fatal and non-fatal stroke, respectively. Type 2 diabetes without CVD captured the population's dynamic movement that considered predicted migration and mortality changes. Migration in people with type 2 diabetes and mortality data stratified by sex and single year of age were extracted from the 2017 ABS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cardiovascular Disease Risk in the Type 2 Diabetes with Established Cardiovascular Disease Population</title><p id="Par18">To calculate the transition probabilities of recurrent fatal and non-fatal CVD in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD, data from the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry were used, which includes 30,043 people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Cardiovascular risk rates from the REACH registry were only reported as overall rates. Thus, these were adjusted to single-age event probabilities via increasing or decreasing the cardiovascular risk from the median age in the REACH registry (72 years) as per age variations in cardiovascular mortality rates in Australia (thus assuming the effect of age on fatal and non-fatal CVD is equivalent). Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular event rates for diabetes people can be seen in ESM Table 7, and the estimated transition probabilities are shown in ESM Table 8. To account for the non-CVD deaths in this cohort, we initially used the age- and sex-specific mortality rates for the general Australian population from the General Record of Incidence of Mortality 2019, as contemporary age- and sex-specific mortality rates for Australians with type 2 diabetes are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Then we adjusted these rates for people with type 2 diabetes based on data from a Danish diabetes registry that included over 400,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes from 1996 to 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To estimate the mortality rates by single year of age, mortality rates for the age group were first plotted against the midpoint age for that age group (e.g., 50 for the age group 45&#8211;54 years). Then polynomial functions were applied to model the mortality rates for age in single years (ESM Table 9).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes</title><p id="Par19">To account for the new cases of type 2 diabetes over time, incident type 2 diabetes cases were added each year for type 2 diabetes to the cohorts with and without CVD until 2031. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were obtained from the NDSS (2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and we assumed that the incidence rates would remain constant throughout the time horizon (ESM Table 10 shows the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes per 1000 persons). Because the NDSS does not quantify the proportion of people with incident type 2 diabetes with or without prior MI/stroke, published sources were used to estimate the ratios.

The utility weight for type 2 diabetes (0.83) was derived from the ADVANCE trial, which included 978 Australians with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The same study was used to obtain the weighted utilities of acute (at baseline) and chronic (at 2 years) CVD events. The utility score in people with type 2 diabetes who had acute MI was 0.80, and was 0.75 for acute stroke. The utility for chronic CVD (MI/stroke) was set at 0.81 with a weighted utility score decrement of 0.02. To calculate the composite utility within 12 months for the type 2 diabetes population who experience the first non-fatal event (MI/stroke), we applied 6 months of the &#8216;type 2 diabetes&#8217; utility score, 3 months of the acute utility (MI/stroke), and 3 months of the chronic CVD utility. For the type 2 diabetes with established CVD population, acute utility scores were applied for 3 months, and chronic utilities were applied for the remaining 9 months.

Validation</title><p id="Par48">External validation suggests that our model may overestimate the burden of CVD in type 2 diabetes in Australia. The AdViSHE checklist is presented in ESM Table 19. Our model was validated by comparing the model's findings versus the results reported by the AIHW and Morton et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additionally, our findings were compared against the results of the study by Marquina et al., which estimated the burden of CVD among Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our model over predicted non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and CVD death in primary and secondary prevention. Calibration results are presented in ESM Table 20.</p><p id="Par49">The CHEERS assessment is presented in ESM Table 21.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">This study is the first to report the health and economic impact of CVD among people with type 2 diabetes over the next decade and the first in the literature to use a multistate dynamic model, which reflected predicted changes in migration and death, as well as incident type 2 diabetes over time.</p><p id="Par51">Our findings show that CVD in the type 2 diabetes population will substantially impact the healthcare system and society by 2031, in line with recent Australian reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Our projections indicate that the combined number of fatal and non-fatal CVD events experienced by Australians with type 2 diabetes aged 40&#8211;89 years will be 50,204 and 142,392, respectively, between 2022 and 2031.</p><p id="Par52">The model also expected that the total costs among Australians with type 2 diabetes, with and without CVD, will exceed AU$18.66 billion from a societal perspective, with higher costs in males than in females, which might be due to more males having type 2 diabetes with and without CVD.</p><p id="Par53">Furthermore, fatal and non-fatal CVD events decreased over time in males with type 2 diabetes with established CVD, which might be explained by lower life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Our model demonstrated more QALYs and less total costs in people with type 2 diabetes without CVD compared to those with type 2 diabetes and CVD (5,730,796 vs 902,101) and (AU$7.67 billion vs AU$10.78 billion), respectively. Importantly, our findings showed that there will be a significant decrease in the total cost of type 2 diabetes and CVD by 2031 compared to 2022 (AU$834.67 million vs AU$1.46 billion). This is mostly driven by the decrease in the size of the Australian population with type 2 diabetes and CVD from 186,753 males and females in 2022 to 166,612 males and females by 2031. It could also be due to the increased mortality events (34,924 in 2031 vs 27,040 in 2022). This is in line with a recent study in Australia that showed that mortality due to diabetes increased from 2010 to 2016, with an average of nearly 3% annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Results of previous studies are not comparable to our findings due to expected different approaches to modelling. Previous studies were based on the simple Markov cohort, versus a multistate dynamic model in our study. The multistate dynamic nature of our model allowed for demographic variations over time and incidence of type 2 diabetes to reflect a more realistic picture of CVD burden and projection of CVD burden in type 2 diabetes in Australia. Additionally, while in fixed Markov models results are reported per person, it is a challenge to include per person outcomes in dynamic models. Previous published dynamic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] have only reported the total impact, with an explanation that every individual in the model has a different follow-up, and this will not represent true costs per person over 10 years.</p><p id="Par56">A systematic review by Einarson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] included data from 13 countries ranging from less than 1 year to 10 years of follow-up, and revealed that CVD costs contributed between 20 and 49% of the total healthcare cost of managing type 2 diabetes. The total costs comprised inpatient and outpatient costs (i.e., emergency department visits, hospitalization, pharmaceuticals, laboratory, and physician visits). The same study reported excess costs of CVD of US$3418&#8211;US$9705 per person per year as opposed to those without CVD in the type 2 diabetes population. Furthermore, Einarson et al.&#8217;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] found that the healthcare cost of managing CVD due to type 2 diabetes was mostly attributed to hospital&#8217;s resource utilization compared to chronic costs, which was the key driver in our study. Studies included in this systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] were capturing only direct cost of disease; this in return may largely underestimate the actual economic burden of CVD in type 2 diabetes. Another systematic review, by Vaidya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], included studies from six countries and revealed that CVD (MI/stroke) was the second contributor to the healthcare burden among people with type 2 diabetes after end-stage renal disease. The total healthcare costs (i.e., emergency visits, hospitalization, outpatient costs, and prescription medication) ranged from US$8805 to US$9648 per person with type 2 diabetes and CVD in the US. However, the Vaidya et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] focused on the prevalence of CVD complications in people with type 2 diabetes rather than new incidence cases.</p><p id="Par57">A study by Straka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] reported that people with type 2 diabetes incurred higher direct medical costs for cardiovascular care during their first hospitalization than those without type 2 diabetes in the US. The total healthcare costs in people with type 2 diabetes and CVD over a 3-year follow-up period in Straka et al. was US$16,149 per person.</p><p id="Par58">In Australia, a previous study by Marquina et al. portrayed the burden of CVD among general Australians irrespective of their diabetes status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although this study demonstrates the total burden of CVD in Australians, less than 10% of the Australians included in the model comprised people with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the study did not reflect the true picture of the health and economic impact of type 2 diabetes. The Marquina et al. study reported 377,754 fatal cardiovascular events and 991,375 non-fatal cardiovascular events, compared to 50,204 fatal cardiovascular events and 142,392 non-fatal cardiovascular events, respectively, in our current study. The reported total costs in the Marquina et al. study were also higher than in the current study, AU$140.65 billion versus AU$18.66 billion. This is likely reflecting the higher number of Australians with and without CVD in the Marquina et al. study compared to only the type 2 diabetes population in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Of note, Marquina et al. did not capture the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those initially without type 2 diabetes. This is essential to designing strategies focused on CVD complications associated with management of type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="Par59">Our study, as such will serve as a foundation for future work to investigate different strategies to optimize the control of different risk factors for the prevention and treatment of CVD in Australians with type 2 diabetes using comprehensive dynamic models. The dynamic nature of our model might also help inform the budget impact analysis of future treatments or prevention programs. It is crucial to allocate resources efficiently, design strategies focused on type 2 diabetes patients, and aid policy makers and clinicians in prioritizing interventions to prevent and manage CVD in type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="Par60">We acknowledge several limitations in our model. Firstly, clinicians have expressed concerns in relation to the 2013 PCE-ASCVD algorithm performance for the type 2 diabetes without CVD population, as it has been only validated among adults aged 40&#8211;79 years, and suboptimal calibration in people 80 years or older may overestimate the risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. However, the 2013 PCE-ASCVD has been validated, and demonstrated better performance, in Australians with type 2 diabetes, compared to 1991 Framingham, 2008 Framingham, and 2008 office-based Framingham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] models, and has been recommended in clinical practice for risk stratification to guide primary prevention strategies for people with ASCVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, the current study calibration results revealed that the PCE-ASCVD performed better against Australian mortality and incidence rates data. We did not use the Fremantle diabetes-specific CVD risk equation for Australians, as it has been validated to predict 5-year CVD risk and was based on a population from Western Australia only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Additionally, the Fremantle risk equation did not include smoking, hypertension treatment, or systolic blood pressure as risk factors. In contrast, the 2013 PCE-ASCVD validation was based on the AusDiab study population, a national, longitudinal, population-based cohort study in six Australian states and the Northern Territory, and followed people for 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">A second limitation is that we used data from the 2011&#8211;2012 NHS, where only 313 Australians with type 2 diabetes, aged 40&#8211;90 years were available. However, the NHS data represents the only nationally available sample population in Australia for these purposes. Another limitation is that we did not consider the equity issues in the model, such as socioeconomic characteristics. Based on a recent study, CVD is expected to influence Australians in the lowest socioeconomic quintile the most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Also a limitation, with regard to the type 2 diabetes with established CVD population, is that we obtained the CVD risk from the REACH registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which is limited to 4 years follow-up only, but the REACH registry is a global registry where almost 3000 people were enrolled from Australia.</p><p id="Par62">An added limitation is that the proportions of fatal and non-fatal MI and stroke events among Australians were not stratified according to age and sex. This may result in an overestimation or underestimation of the effects. In addition, it was difficult to account for employee replacement costs in the model. However, our model may more accurately reflect the real-world picture of lost productivity, in which replacement of employees may not always be possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In any case, including this information will further increase the productivity loss (i.e., overestimate the effect). A seventh limitation is that the model also did not consider the on-costs for employees, such as payroll tax and compensation insurance, as these were difficult to accurately estimate, which may overestimate the productivity loss (i.e., overestimate the burden). The fact that the model omits intangible costs and costs associated with traveling time and spillover effects on families due to disease burden is another model limitation, which may underestimate the indirect costs. It is also important to acknowledge that other lost productivity costs of complications that are associated with type 2 diabetes, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, were not accounted for in the model. Including this information, however, will only increase the economic burden of productivity loss. Finally, the performance of our projection model might lead to different findings depending on the input variables. For example, when we considered multiple scenario analyses to account for optimal and suboptimal risk-factor control, such as varying type 2 diabetes and CVD prevalence by &#177;&#160;10%, the number of fatal and non-fatal CVD events and overall costs changed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par63">In conclusion, our analysis provides original insights and projects nationally representative estimates of CVD&#8217;s societal burden among people with type 2 diabetes in Australia between 2022 and 2031.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="40273_2023_1258_MOESM1_ESM.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 422 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.
