This study examined the convergent validity of a person-dependent definition of flares (&#8220;a worsening of your low back pain that lasts from hours to weeks&#8221;) as compared to (1) LBP intensity, (2) LBP-related pain interference, and (3) analgesic use, in a large, prospective research study of Veterans with LBP. Veterans seeking care for LBP (n=465) were followed prospectively for up to 1 year. Participants completed up to 36 scheduled surveys and additional patient-initiated surveys (triggered by the onset of new flares) over follow-up. Each survey inquired about current flare status, pain intensity measured on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS), LBP-related pain interference, and analgesic use. Linear mixed-effects models estimated the association between current flare status and pain intensity, with and without adjustment for potential confounding factors; secondary analyses examined associations with pain interference and analgesic use. In longitudinal analyses of 11,817 surveys, flare status was significantly associated with a 2.8-NRS-point greater pain intensity (p&lt;0.0001), with and without adjustment for other factors. Statistically significant associations were found between flare status and LBP-related pain interference and analgesic use. New flare periods were associated with impacts on coping, functional limitations, and mood/emotions. These findings support the convergent validity of a person-dependent flare definition.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="summary"><title>SUMMARY</title><p id="P2">A person-dependent definition of &#8220;flare&#8221; among individuals with low back pain has convergent validity as shown by its associations with pain intensity and pain interference.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1.</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and associated with greater healthcare costs in the United States (US) than any other health condition.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] While low back pain has traditionally been characterized as a dichotomy of &#8220;acute&#8221; (short-duration pain) and &#8220;chronic&#8221; (long-duration pain, typically &#8805;3 months), it is now recognized that these features are insufficient by themselves to describe the varied trajectories and patterns of changes in pain that are part of the LBP experience.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Exacerbations of existing LBP or new LBP episodes, collectively referred to as &#8220;flares&#8221; or &#8220;flare-ups&#8221;, are an important feature of the LBP experience not captured by a &#8220;acute&#8221; and &#8220;chronic&#8221; dichotomy of pain. As compared to those with LBP who do not experience intermittent flares, people with LBP who do have flares tend to experience greater back pain-related disability, lost work time, and societal costs.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Accordingly, the prevention and treatment of LBP flares have begun to receive attention as potential ways to mitigate the substantial negative societal impact of LBP.</p><p id="P4"><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents definitions of LBP flares used in prior research on this topic. Typically, flare definitions are presented to research participants, who then endorse whether a flare is present currently and specify other aspects of flare history. Used in this manner, a flare definition is a critical part of a <italic toggle="yes">measure</italic> that can ascertain the presence or absence of a flare. Early definitions of flares focused on pain severity or intensity when presenting the flare concept to participants.[17; 18; 23] More recently, researchers have tried to establish new LBP flare definitions that incorporate participants&#8217; perspectives on the experience of flares (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by defining flares not only in terms of increased pain but also in terms of participants&#8217; perceptions of their reactions to pain and/or the effects of flares on pain-related outcomes or &#8220;domains&#8221; other than pain intensity, such as mood and coping.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] An alternative to these types of researcher-specified flare definitions is to allow participants to decide what a flare is from their perspective: a <italic toggle="yes">person-dependent flare definition</italic>. This flare definition can then be followed by additional question items that allow participants to specify the pain-related <italic toggle="yes">domains</italic> involved in a given flare. To date, few flare definitions [3; 17] [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have been subjected to quantitative assessments of convergent validity with regards to pain intensity and/or other factors associated with the pain experience (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">This study examined the convergent validity of a person-dependent LBP flare definition focused on &#8220;worsening&#8221; of LBP as perceived by the participant. The study aim was to examine the validity of this flare definition as compared to outcome domains that are commonly used in LBP research, including (1) pain intensity, (2) pain interference (pain-related functional limitations), and (3) analgesic use as a reflection of the need for concurrent pain treatment. We hypothesized that, if valid, the presence of a flare using a person-dependent LBP flare definition would be significantly associated with measures of pain intensity, pain interference (pain-related functional limitations), and analgesic use.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2.</label><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Conceptual overview.</title><p id="P6">Although the concept of a &#8220;flare&#8221; is common to many pain and rheumatologic conditions,[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] there is no widespread agreement on how to operationalize the assessment of flares or what participant-reported measure should be used to ascertain whether a flare is present. In general, research has taken two approaches to LBP flare definitions.</p><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1.</label><title>Pain intensity-focused flare definitions.</title><p id="P7">The first approach, articulated in the earliest publications on &#8220;flares&#8221; or &#8220;flare-ups,&#8221;[18; 23] was to define flares primarily as increases in pain intensity or severity (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which we refer to henceforth as <italic toggle="yes">pain intensity-focused flare definitions</italic>. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> shows a conceptual model depicting one example of a pain intensity-focused flare definition, illustrating how a risk factor may cause a pain intensity-focused flare, which in turn might cause other downstream sequelae such as changes in mood or functional limitations (which are associated with each other). A variation on model A could include bidirectional arrows between incident LBP/increased LBP intensity and changes in mood and/or functional limitations. Numerous other models with other consequences or correlates of pain intensity-focused flares can be envisioned.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.1.2.</label><title>Multidimensional flare definitions.</title><p id="P8">The second approach has been to consider a more holistic concept of flares, defined not only by pain intensity but by other domains that are part of the pain experience, some of which may occur as a consequence of increased pain intensity and some which might occur independent of or without increases in pain intensity. We refer to this second approach as a <italic toggle="yes">multidimensional flare definition</italic>. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates a conceptual model exemplifying a multidimensional flare definition, in which flares are defined not only by increases in pain intensity, but also or instead are defined by changes in mood and/or functional limitations.</p><p id="P9">Beginning with results from an Australian online qualitative study of people with LBP by Setchell et al. [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], multidimensional flare definitions were developed by Costa and Hodges and colleagues in a multistage process. Setchell et al. aimed to determine how flares were experienced from the perspective of individuals who retrospectively characterized their flare experiences.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Content analyses found that increased pain was the feature most commonly associated with flares (79% of participants), followed by &#8220;other sensations&#8221; such as paresthesias, stiffness, and spasms (58%), functional limitations (50%), and changes in emotions and thinking (37%).[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These results led to an <italic toggle="yes">interim multidimensional flare definition</italic> incorporating not only pain intensity but several other domains associated with flares: &#8220;A flare is an increase in pain or other related symptoms that lasts from hours to weeks and is difficult to settle. You may also have mood changes and/or difficulty with your normal activity.&#8221;[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The idea that a multidimensional flare definition may capture something different from increased pain intensity was supported by data from a separate cohort of people with LBP, in which 68% of flares defined using a multidimensional flare definition were not accompanied by an increase in LBP intensity of &#8805;2 numeric rating scale (NRS) points, and 36% of periods with an increase in LBP intensity of &#8805;2 NRS points were not identified as a multidimensional flares.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, this lack of complete overlap between two different flare definitions may simply reflect psychometric characteristics such as the lack of complete test-retest reliability with any self-report measure,[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] variation between any two measures evaluating the same pain construct,[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] the use of a cutoff for increased pain intensity that was quite high (&#8805;2 points), and/or the likelihood that requiring a LBP intensity increase of &#8805;2 NRS points will often (but not always) select a subset of flares that are more severe.</p><p id="P10">After input and refinement from LBP experts, a Delphi process to reach consensus, and testing in a predominantly Australian sample of individuals with LBP, changes were made to the interim multidimensional flare definition: the term &#8220;worsening&#8221; was added in order to cover all potential symptoms associated with LBP rather than highlighting pain intensity alone, and the phrase &#8220;your condition&#8221; was added in order to refer not only to LBP but to related symptoms such as stiffness, spasms, and others. The resultant <italic toggle="yes">final multidimensional flare definition</italic> after these stages of input and refinement defined a flare as &#8220;&#8230;a worsening of your condition that lasts from hours to weeks that is difficult to tolerate and generally impacts your usual activities and/or emotions.&#8221;[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This multidimensional flare definition has the strength of having involved an expert consensus process in its development, but&#8212; unlike the interim flare definition[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]&#8212; it has not yet received quantitative validation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.2</label><title>Rationale for a third approach: a person-dependent flare definition.</title><p id="P11">The person-dependent flare definition derived for use in the current study was developed to (1) incorporate common elements among prior flare definitions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) address potential strengths and limitations of pain intensity-focused flare definitions and multidimensional flare definitions.</p><p id="P12">A common element across prior flare definitions is the specification of a minimum and maximum period of time during which a change in pain characteristics would be considered a flare, so that periods of worsened symptoms that are too short (e.g., a momentary increase in pain) or too long (e.g., a 6-month period of increased pain, which would be considered a new baseline level of more severe pain) would not count as a flare. Durations of &#8220;hours&#8221; to &#8220;weeks&#8221; were most commonly specified across prior flare definitions, and these bounds for duration were therefore incorporated into the current study&#8217;s person-dependent flare definition.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p id="P13">A potential strength of the multidimensional flare definitions developed by Costa and colleagues was their expansion of the flare definition to include other pain-associated domains besides pain intensity.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, there are also possible limitations from this decision. First, the qualitative methods of Setchell et al. used to inform the multidimensional flare definition were intended to capture the patient experience of flares, without a need to discriminate <italic toggle="yes">components</italic> of flares from <italic toggle="yes">consequences</italic> of flares. While the distinctions between these aspects may be immaterial to patients, combining them into a single flare definition could pose problems for researchers who wish to disentangle the components of flares from the consequences of flares. For example, if a risk factor was found to be associated with a multidimensional definition of flares, including changes in pain intensity, mood, and/or functional limitations, it would be unknown which of these three domains was driving the risk factor-flare association (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A second potential limitation is that the flare-associated domains included in the multidimensional flare definitions by Costa and colleagues might have been specific to the internet-based sample of Australian people in which they were derived. This could limit the definition&#8217;s external validity when applied to people from other countries, health care systems, and/or sociocultural backgrounds.</p><p id="P14">A potential strength of pain intensity-focused flare definitions is that they may allow researchers to better separate the components of flares from the consequences of flares (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A potential limitation of such a definition, however, is suggested by the qualitative study by Setchell et al., in which 79% of individuals with LBP perceived increased pain intensity to be a component of flares, yet 21% did not.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>],</p><p id="P15">Given these considerations, the current study evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel flare measure based on a <italic toggle="yes">person-dependent flare definition</italic> (i.e., &#8220;&#8230;a worsening of your low back pain that lasts from hours to weeks&#8221;). This definition inquires about &#8220;worsening&#8221; of LBP in an open-ended manner. When a flare is reported using a person-dependent flare definition, it is meant to be followed by <italic toggle="yes">descriptive questions</italic> that inquire specifically about the pain-related domains that are perceived to be components of the flare for a given participant. While the person-dependent flare definition is expected to include pain intensity, which is the most prevalent component of flares, a strength of the definition is that it allows for different participant perspectives on the pain-related domains that comprise flares in different populations, without the researcher specifying what those domains must be. This addresses the concern about generalizability of the multidimensional flare definitions by Costa and colleagues noted above, as flare components identified by one population are not be assumed to be applicable to another population. Another strength of the person-dependent flare definition is that, when followed by the above-mentioned descriptive questions, the descriptive questions allow the researcher to know precisely which pain domains are described as components of flares by a given participant. This allows the researcher to conduct <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses examining the subset of flares reflecting any combination of flare components specified by the researcher. For example, a researcher using the person-dependent flare definition could conduct secondary analyses using an alternate flare definition that emulates the final multidimensional flare definition of Costa et al. by specifying the type of flare to be analyzed as one that meets the person-dependent flare definition, but also requiring that the flare be described by the participant as difficult to tolerate, <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> either impacting usual activities <italic toggle="yes">or</italic> emotions. Alternatively, if a researcher wishes to narrow down to a more exclusively pain intensity-focused definition of flares (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) to mitigate the potential conflation of flare components and flare consequences in a single flare outcome, they could specify an alternative flare definition that requires flares to meet the person-dependent flare definition, but also requires that flares be described by the participant as involving greater pain intensity than is usual for a participant, or having higher pain NRS ratings as compared to a participant&#8217;s non-flare periods.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.3</label><title>Study sample.</title><p id="P16">We evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel flare measure based on a person-dependent flare definition in an ancillary study to a longitudinal case-crossover study of people with LBP. Participants were recruited between April 2020 and September 2023 from adults seen for LBP in the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS). VAPSHCS provides health care to military Veterans in the US states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. The study was approved by the VAPSHCS Institutional Review Board (01860). Inclusion criteria included: (1) age 18 to 65 years; (2) having pain in the area of the low back between the lowest ribs and the gluteal fold, with or without lower extremity radiating symptoms; (3) regular access to a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access; (4) having a mobile phone capable of receiving text messages; (5) basic computer literacy; and (6) being able to understand and read English sufficient to provide informed consent and complete the study assessments. Exclusion criteria included: (1) pregnancy; (2) being imprisoned; (3) having a &#8220;red flag&#8221; condition such as spinal infection, malignancy, fracture, or spondyloarthropathy; (4) unstable or severe psychiatric conditions (e.g., delirium, mania, psychosis, thought disorder); (5) dementia or other significant cognitive dysfunction; (6) thoracolumbar spine surgery in the past 1 year; and (6) major orthopedic, abdominal, or chest surgery within the past 6 months. The parent study was designed primarily to examine the short- and long-term effects of physical activities on flares of LBP and was not designed specifically or exclusively for the current analyses.

The study&#8217;s main finding was that LBP flares measured based on a participant-dependent flare definition (i.e., &#8220;A flare of low back pain is a worsening of your low back pain that lasts from hours to weeks&#8221;) were highly significantly associated with more severe pain outcomes on validated LBP-related outcome measures, with or without adjustment for person-level factors. Participant flare periods were associated with greater LBP intensity NRS values than non-flare periods by an average of nearly 3 NRS points, a large difference well above the commonly accepted minimal clinically important change (MCIC) values of 1&#8211;2 NRS points.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly, participant flare periods were highly significantly associated with greater LBP pain interference by nearly 3 NRS points and a 4-fold increase in the odds of analgesic use, as compared to non-flare periods. New flare periods were perceived as having impacts on many pain-related domains (e.g., coping, functional limitations, mood/emotions, and others). These results provide strong support for the convergent validity of the measure based on this participant-dependent flare definition.</p><p id="P41">The findings of the current study comport with prior studies examining the convergent validity of flare definitions with pain intensity. In the first longitudinal study to validate a flare definition, Suri and colleagues found that a pain intensity-focused flare definition (i.e., &#8220;...a period of increased pain lasting at least 2 hours, when your pain intensity is distinctly worse than it has been recently&#8221;) was significantly associated with a 2.7-NRS-point greater pain intensity during flare vs. non-flare periods, nearly the same magnitude association with flare status (2.8 NRS points) found in the current study.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Similarly, Costa and colleagues reported statistically significant greater average LBP intensity during flare vs. non-flare periods of between 1.3 to 3.3 NRS points when assessing the presence of an LBP flare using a pain intensity-focused definition, and smaller-magnitude yet still significant differences in LBP intensity between flare vs. non-flare periods (between 0.3 and 0.9 NRS points) when a multidimensional pain definition was used. In addition, and also similar to the current study&#8217;s finding of significantly greater pain interference and analgesic use during flare periods vs. non-flare periods, Costa and colleagues found greater LBP-related pain interference and analgesic use with both pain intensity-focused and multidimensional flare definitions, although pain intensity-focused definitions generally had larger-magnitude associations with flare status than did multidimensional flare definitions for non-pain intensity outcomes such as LBP-related pain interference, mood-related outcomes, and most other outcomes (with the exception of analgesic use).[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The findings of the current study are generally consistent with results derived from qualitative research that flares involve dimensions that are broader than pain intensity alone.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] On the other hand, one could argue that the experience of pain in general impacts dimensions and domains broader than pain intensity alone, so in this respect flares are no different than any other aspect of the pain experience. Of note, the proportion of flare periods in which participants in the current study reported the co-existence of impacts on coping, functional limitations, and mood/emotions exceeded the prevalences found in the qualitative research of Setchell and colleagues,[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which may be explained by the different study designs, settings, and flare definitions used.</p><p id="P42">During 19% of flare periods in the current study, participants reported their LBP intensity was roughly the same as their usual LBP when not having flare, indicating that respondent interpretations of the study&#8217;s participant-dependent flare definition did not require perceived &#8220;worsening&#8221; to be defined by increases in pain intensity alone. This proportion closely resembles the finding of Setchell and colleagues that 21% of people with flares did not report pain intensity increase as part of the flare experience.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the current study, some proportion of flare periods reported as having &#8220;the same&#8221; LBP intensity as usual were reported to impact coping (28%) or mood/emotions (46%), such that pain intensity may have remained the same, but participants&#8217; ability to cope with that pain may have decreased, or they may have developed mood impairments (e.g., greater depression symptoms) as a result of being in pain, resulting in the perception of a flare taking place. Additionally, large proportions of flare periods were reported as having the same LBP intensity as usual were associated with brief, transient increases in pain (57%) or feelings like the back was weaker or more vulnerable than usual (42%) in the preceding 24 hours, either of which might have contributed to the perception of a flare even when current LBP intensity was no different during flare vs. non-flare periods. However, another explanation for the 19% of flare periods reported as having roughly the same LBP intensity as usual could simply be imprecision or inaccuracy in reporting caused by the subjective nature of pain assessments. Such an explanation is suggested by <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses indicating that even during flare periods when participants reported that their LBP intensity was the same as usual, their average LBP intensity was 2 NRS points higher than during non-flare periods.</p><p id="P43">A strength of this study is the large number of participants and very large number of periods analyzed (&gt;11,000) over 1-year of follow-up. Another unique strength is that, as reported elsewhere,[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the current study sample has been shown to be representative of the underlying study population of military Veterans with LBP served by the VAPSHCS healthcare system serving 5 states in the western US, with respect to a wide range of sociodemographic, medical, psychological, and other clinical factors. A study limitation is that although we established the convergent validity of the study&#8217;s participant-dependent flare definition as compared to LBP intensity, LBP-related pain interference, and analgesic use, we did not conduct similar analyses for other important pain-related domains (e.g., changes in depression, coping, etc.). Further, one could argue that the participant-dependent flare definition for LBP used in the current study implies pain intensity as a requisite for flare, as participants who had difficulty understanding the study&#8217;s flare definition and required more information to distinguish flare vs. non-flare periods were encouraged to consider an increase in their LBP intensity &#8805;2 NRS points over their usual LBP intensity as a tool to help them identify flares. Nevertheless, the current study&#8217;s finding that 19% of participants reported their LBP intensity during flare was the same as their usual LBP intensity argues against the idea that participants believed that an increase in LBP intensity over their usual intensity is always necessary for such an event to &#8220;count&#8221; as a flare. Moreover, prior work using multidimensional flare definitions that included more explicit specification of increased pain intensity as a requirement for flare (&#8220;an increase in pain&#8230;&#8221;) have concluded that flares using such definitions were not defined by pain intensity alone.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Finally, the current study does not examine whether participant-dependent flare definitions are better or worse than pain intensity-focused or multidimensional pain definitions, which is a worthwhile future research direction.</p><p id="P44">Despite possible limitations, the current study&#8217;s findings support the convergent validity of a new measure of LBP flares based on a participant-dependent flare definition. This participant-dependent flare definition can be used by researchers to examine the frequency and impact of LBP flares, as well as the impact of interventions designed to decrease LBP flares.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="media-1.docx" id="d67e683" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p id="P45">Dr. Suri, Dr. Korpak, Mr. Timmons, Ms. Tanus, Ms. Brubeck, and Dr. Daniels are employees of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, Washington.
