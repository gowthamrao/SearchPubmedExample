This paper aimed to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of CDM policies over a lifetime for long-time survivors of stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A Markov model, using three health states (stable, hospitalised, dead), was developed to simulate the costs and benefits of CDM policies over 30 years (with 1-year cycles). Transition probabilities and costs from a health system perspective were obtained from the linkage of data between the Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (cohort <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12,368, 42% female, median age 70 years, 45% had CDM claims) and government-held hospital, Medicare, and pharmaceutical claims datasets. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from a comparable cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 512, 34% female, median age 69.6 years, 52% had CDM claims) linked with Medicare claims and death data. A 3% discount rate was applied to costs in Australian dollars (AUD, 2016) and QALYs beyond 12 months. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to understand uncertainty.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Per-person average total lifetime costs were AUD 142,939 and 8.97 QALYs for those with a claim, and AUD 103,889 and 8.98 QALYs for those without a claim.

The probability of cost-effectiveness of CDM policies was 26.1%, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD 50,000/QALY.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CDM policies, designed to encourage comprehensive care, are unlikely to be cost-effective for stroke compared to care without CDM.

There is evidence that nationwide multidisciplinary care programs, with financial incentives, could reduce mortality and morbidity and improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) post-stroke [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A comprehensive care plan aimed at preventing recurrent stroke, improving functional and psychological status, and managing risk factors and comorbidities is recommended to optimise long-term care for people with stroke [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Since 1999, the Australian Government has been providing incentives to primary care physicians (PCPs) who deliver chronic disease management (CDM) to people with chronic conditions, such as stroke [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These CDM policies include Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items which cover the development and review of CDM plans. The CDM plans are developed by physicians in collaboration with patients to detail the problems, management goals, actions, and services needed by the patient [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2016, 51% of survivors of stroke were provided with CDM plans [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Claims related to CDM policies have doubled over the last decade and are estimated to be worth nearly AUD 1 billion annually [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In a recent evaluation of CDM policies, compared to those without a claim for a CDM plan, those with a claim between 7 and 18 months following stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) had improved survival by 26% between 19 and 30 months but increased hospitalisations by 17% [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Two-thirds had unplanned hospitalisations, mostly for cardiovascular disease, chest pain or collapse, and abnormal findings. From a policy perspective, it is also important to understand cost-effectiveness within the context of the current health system. In this study, we estimated the potential cost-effectiveness of government-funded CDM policies for long-term survivors of stroke or TIA over a lifetime from an Australian government funder perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A cost-utility analysis was conducted using Markov modelling in accordance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data Sources and Input Parameters</title><p>Input parameters for Markov models were obtained from cohorts of two studies: Evaluation of enhanced models of primary care in the management of stroke and other chronic disease (PRECISE study) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Shared Team Approach between Nurses and Doctors for Improved Risk Factor Management (STANDFIRM) trial [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

The Australian Government financially incentivises PCPs who provide targeted management for people with chronic diseases in the form of CDM plans [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A CDM plan is a care plan developed by physicians in collaboration with patients and includes problems, management goals, actions, and services needed by the patient [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The claims data we used lacked information about the content of CDM plans. A CDM plan (MBS item 721) can be claimed once every 12 months, and its review (MBS item 732) once every 3 months [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Costs covered all-cause hospitalisations, Medicare services, and medications (painkillers, antihypertensive, antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, and anti-inflammatory agents; medications to treat anxiety, depression, arthritis, and osteoporosis). Costs of hospitalisation were calculated using the average cost of inpatient separations by diagnosis-related group obtained from all hospitals from the relevant state-held patient admission datasets [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, the costs of emergency department (ED) presentations were estimated using state-held ED datasets, which include ED data from public hospitals.</p><p>Medicare services included community-based services covered by the Australian Government, such as primary care, speciality care, allied health, and pathology (online suppl. eTable 3).

Each year, individuals either remained stable, were hospitalised for any reason, or died.

Over a lifetime, primary care with CDM claims was more expensive and less effective than primary care where a CDM claim was not made. Results were similar when both a CDM plan and its review, or different time horizons, discount rates, or approaches to estimating QALYs, were considered, and there was considerable uncertainty around these findings. Identification of health needs, increased surveillance, and referral pathways imposed by the CDM plans likely contributed to the increased costs. A review of these policies for stroke or TIA to optimise their use may be warranted.</p><p>Our model outputs were compared to other published literature for sense checking. For example, the cumulative proportion of the simulated cohort who died over 30 years in our model was 67.7%, while 87.8% of the 2,051 people with stroke who were followed up over 30 years died in the Copenhagen City Heart Study [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This difference may be explained by the fact that the cohorts from which we used input parameters for the model consisted of long-term survivors of stroke or TIA (&gt;15 months), whereas the Copenhagen City Heart Study was a population-based study. We also compared per-patient costs from the model with those published in the literature. Our estimate of the average direct per-patient cost across two study groups was AUD 120,028 for ischaemic strokes over 30 years. This is similar to the lifetime costs reported in the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (AUD 122,208 for ischaemic stroke and AUD 97,661 for intracerebral haemorrhage, converted from a reference year of 2010&#8211;2016 with annual 3% discounting). However, the lifetime costs in the NEMESIS included informal care and productivity loss, costs that we did not have available [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, in a recent modelling study, the medical costs of stroke over 30 years were AUD 99,690 in the reference year of 2018 and based on inputs from a very early rehabilitation trial, a clinical trial of rehabilitation following stroke [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our cost estimates are within the bounds of these two studies, thereby providing some confidence in our results.</p><p>To our knowledge, there has not been a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing government-funded CDM policies in primary care for stroke in Australia. Comparison to other studies is challenging because post-stroke care interventions are complex [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and our study is novel. However, the conclusion that the policy supporting CDM was unlikely to be cost-effective is in line with those of short-term cost-effectiveness analyses of other similar interventions. Two cost-utility analyses with 1-year follow-up involving related but different types of structured interventions have been conducted, both based on randomised controlled trials [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In one of the trials conducted in the UK (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 800), community-based long-term stroke care incorporating structured and individualised care planning was not cost-effective compared to usual care from both health system and societal perspectives [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the other trial, conducted in the Netherlands (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 113), self-management intervention incorporating action planning was not cost-effective over education-based intervention from a societal perspective [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although some aspects of these interventions are relevant to CDM, these studies were efficacy trials and, unlike PRECISE, did not include an evaluation of the population effect of an already implemented policy.</p><p>There is evidence that CDM plans used in Australia can be cost-effective for cardiovascular diseases other than stroke. Primary care with CDM plans was found to be cost-effective in coronary heart disease (CHD), with an ICER of AUD 8,081 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) in a modelling study (reference year 2006) by Chew et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, these analyses were based on numerous assumptions, including a 15% reduction in CHD premature deaths and DALYs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The authors referred to a 17% reduction in CHD deaths and a 15% reduction in CHD events reported in the 1998 National Health Priority Areas Report, but these estimates were also based on assumed potential gains &#8220;through improved acute management of patients&#8221; [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, the long-term disability that often occurs as a consequence of stroke is likely to incur much greater costs than CHD. The greatest cost benefits for stroke are likely to be gained from prevention. Further research is warranted to fully understand the cost-effectiveness of CDM policies for patients with CHD and whether such findings can be translated to survivors of stroke.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is that we included input parameters based on patient-level data obtained from large, well-characterised similar cohorts. In particular, costs were estimated from administrative datasets, which are considered to be more reliable than patient-reported data due to issues related to participant attrition and recall bias [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, linking administrative data to the trial and AuSCR provided us with comprehensive clinical and socio-demographic data on the characteristics of the study groups. It is important to know the profiles of the participants in the study groups when observational data are used in economic evaluations. Moreover, we undertook a cost-utility type of economic evaluation, which enables comparison of findings across interventions and disease groups.</p><p>Some limitations of our study are worth noting. The main limitation of our study was that the input parameters for the model were limited to observational datasets. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution because of potential confounding effects between the comparator groups. Additionally, input parameters were obtained from two different cohorts. The STANDFIRM cohort was derived from a trial performed within a single metropolitan region with extensive participant inclusion criteria. Furthermore, half of the STANDFIRM cohort were randomised to receive an enhanced form of CDM that is not part of standard CDM policies, which is different to what was evaluated in PRECISE using population-level CDM claims. Moreover, as we used claims data to identify the use of CDM policies, we were unable to assess the content, quality, or adherence to plans developed under the policy. Additional qualitative research is needed to explore how these plans are actually being used in primary care. Finally, estimated costs were limited to the government funder perspective, and medication costs included only prescribed medications that were subsidised by the government. Therefore, our analyses were limited to direct medical costs. A societal perspective should also be considered in future research, as this is particularly important for people living with long-term impairment following stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide evidence from the perspective of an Australian government funder that CDM policies in primary care are unlikely to be cost-effective for stroke or TIA.
