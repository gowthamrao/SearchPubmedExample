Several studies have characterized the transcriptomic profile of affected and unaffected skin in small populations. In this study of 20 patients, RNA from lesional and matching non-lesional skin biopsies in 20 subjects were used to identify an expression-based HS disease signature. This was followed by differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses, as well as jointly reanalyzing our findings with previously published transcriptomic profiles. We establish an RNA-Seq based HS expression disease signature that is mostly consistent with previous reports. Bulk-RNA profiles from 104 subjects in 7 previously reported data sets identified a disease signature of 118 differentially regulated genes compared to three control data sets from non-lesional skin. We confirmed previously reported expression profiles and further characterized dysregulation in complement activation and host response to bacteria in disease pathogenesis. Changes in the transcriptome of lesional skin in this cohort of HS patients is consistent with smaller previously reported populations. The findings further support the significance of immune dysregulation, in particular with regard to bacterial response mechanisms. Joint analysis of this and previously reported cohorts indicate a remarkably consistent expression profile.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004330</institution-id><institution>GlaxoSmithKline</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.

While historically considered a rare disease, it is clear from recent literature that it relatively common with a prevalence of 0.7&#8211;1% [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with a predilection for female and African-American patients [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite its severe impact on quality of life and relatively high frequency in the population, the pathogenesis of HS is still not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a pressing need to develop more effective treatment as only one FDA-approved treatment, the TNF-inhibitor adalimumab, currently exists with only 50% of patients achieving a meaningful clinical response [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], especially in later disease when the opportunity to stop progression has been missed [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Mechanisms involving follicular occlusion, abnormalities in the skin and follicular microbiome, and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways have been described and supported in relatively small studies and have been recently summarized [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, a number of genetic variants have been reported contributing to HS susceptibility or severity involving genes encoding subunits of the &#947;-secretase protein complex, connexin-26, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor, defensin beta 2 and 3, interleukin-12 receptor, and MyD88 [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], elevated expression was reported for antimicrobial peptides lesional vs non-lesional skin and for inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-36 in lesional skin and blood of patients with HS [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This analysis also discovered increases in complement expression and a plasma cell signature that had not been well-described previously.

While the role of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands in HS has been the subject of much debate, it is difficult to interpret these findings. Given the intense tissue inflammation and destruction in lesional skin the reduced expression of these genes may reflect lack of expression in the general setting of inflammation and new tissue repair, but, in contrast to lesional HS skin, wounded skin has been shown to have increased DCD and AQP5 expression [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, sweat glands have been shown to have a potential role in wound repair [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and it is possible that altered sweat gland structure and function contributes to impaired wound healing in HS. Since HS can appear in locations not typically associated with apocrine glands such as the flank and posterior neck the pathogenesis is unlikely to rest with apocrine glands alone.</p><p>Prominent upregulation of pathways known to be associated with HS including Th-17, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1&#946; are once again features common with many previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Further, increases in classic complement protein expression, particularly those that are cleaved to form anaphylatoxins such a C4 and C5 are consistent with previous reports. We additionally report increased activation of the mannose binding lectin pathway with upregulated ficolin, mannose binding lectin 2, and MASP1 expression. Conversely, CD55, which acts as a check on complement-mediated inflammation by binding to and breaking down complement proteins, is downregulated in lesional HS. This indicates further dysregulation and over activity of complement-mediated inflammation. Inhibitors of C5a have shown early promising results in the treatment of HS, and it is possible that other components of this cascade have therapeutic relevance [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>One of the most striking associations identified in the current dataset is with bacterial response mechanisms, which is reflected in the combination of upregulated AMPs, complement signaling, and inflammatory pathways associated with Th-17, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1&#946;. The clinical features of HS such as abscesses, erythema, warmth, pustules, and purulent drainage are identical in many ways to the presentation of acute bacterial infections such bacterial abscesses, cellulitis, and folliculitis. HS is set apart from cutaneous infections clinically as it is not contagious and leads to chronic/recurrent inflammation that does not fully respond to antibiotics. HS does, however, improve temporarily with broad spectrum antibiotics or antibiotic regimens tailored to the patient microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This indicates that commensal bacteria likely play a role in activating the immune response that mimics the response seen to more classic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, which is identified infrequently in HS lesions. This is possibly related to complement activation by bacteria and subsequent production of anaphylatoxins, though other players in the innate immune response may also be involved [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284047.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Characteristic microbiome patterns in patients with HS have been established [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], but it is unclear if this dysbiosis is a result of abnormal host defenses, an abnormality in follicular structure or function, a combination of these factors, or perhaps merely a byproduct of the inflammatory changes associated of HS. Whether this dysbiosis plays a causal role triggering follicular inflammation or the inflammatory environment of HS leads to characteristic changes in the microbiome is unclear, but the role of commensal bacteria in amplifying and sustaining inflammation in the disease seems certain.</p><p>Joint re-analysis of previously reported data sets in conjunction with these newly reported profiles demonstrates a strikingly consistent disease signature of 118 dysregulated genes in HS lesional skin (<xref rid="pone.0284047.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with our new cohort, the profile indicates that upregulated neutrophil and leukocyte mediated immunity, complement activation, response to bacteria and extracellular matrix remodeling are the predominant pathways activated in HS lesions. While the re-analysis allows for a larger sample size than individual previous reports, it is limited in that it reflects a predominantly Caucasian population from North America and Western Europe. Other challenges include heterogeneity due to varying study designs and transcriptomic platform technologies used. We employed a simple vote-counting method to jointly analyze the current and prior data to sidestep these challenges. A more complex formal meta-analysis could potentially address cohort heterogeneity but integrating microarray and RNA-Seq data in such analysis remains challenging. Our own dataset is also limited since most patients had moderate or severe disease that required surgical intervention, so these findings may not be generalizable to earlier stages of disease. All datasets examined are also limited by a lack of characterization of the histological findings in the tissue, such as the presence of epithelialized tunnels, which likely have an impact on expression patterns and contribute to heterogeneity of the findings [<xref rid="pone.0284047.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Future studies should aim to characterize more diverse and well-characterized populations with more information on disease severity, course, and comorbidities. They should also strive to include patients before and after starting a variety of treatments in significant numbers to help understand how expression profiles may be impacted with various interventions and predict treatment response. Further studies utilizing single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis also have the potential to better characterize HS pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients were recruited in a subspecialty hidradenitis suppurativa clinic at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill Department of Dermatology from October 2017 through February 2018.

This work is well written and organized.</p><p>However, please consider these points:</p><p>1. Page 3, line 48. Please consider this work about HS and Adalimumab mainly focusing on the concept of &#8220;window of opportunity&#8221;: Marzano AV, et al.

Br J Dermatol. 2021;184(1):133-140. doi: 10.1111/bjd.18983.</p><p>2. Page 3, from line 51. Please also consider the involvement of keratinization and autoinflammatory genes such as GJB2, NLRP3 et al. We invite you to consider these works and explore the concept of the polygenic autoinflammatory nature of HS:</p><p>a) Moltrasio C, et al. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Perspective on Genetic Factors Involved in the Disease. Biomedicines. 2022;10(8):2039. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines10082039.</p><p>b) Marzano AV, et al.

Dermatology. 2022;238(5):860-869. doi: 10.1159/000521263.</p><p>3. The table 1 should be expanded. Add other clinical items such as age at diagnosis, age at onset, comorbidities&#8230;</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This paper describes an RNASeq analysis on lesional and non-lesional skin of 20 subjects with HS and a meta-analysis together with the previously published HS transcriptomics studies.</p><p>The authors used a routine method and analyses to strengthen the findings on hidradenitis suppurativa biological pathways involved in skin inflammation.</p><p>This study lacks the clinical characterization of the patients analyzed</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>1. The clinical characteristics of the subjects are poorly described. We could imagine the cohort the Authors studied is enriched for severe patients undergoing a surgical procedure to alleviate HS. It is not clear either how these patients were treated before the surgical procedure as these treatments could impact biological pathways found by the RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>2. It is not clear to me how the non-lesional area was chosen. It is known that dermal lesions and fistula can be present in the dermis without apparent clinical signs on the skin surface. This could have severely affected the genes and pathways found by the RNA-seq experiment.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Introduction- lines 51 to 54 - not all the genes reported in this paragraph have been associated with HS susceptibility. MyD88 and IL-12r, for instance, have been associated only with HS severity. Please correct this part.</p><p>2. Introduction- lines 54 to 56 - where the measures for these cytokines were done is unclear. Blood? Skin? Lesional vs non-lesional skin? HS patients vs controls? This should be better explained</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;Thankyou for the opportunity to review this manuscript- A highly novel and insightful piece with high standard statistcal analyses.</p><p>The only discussion point I would add is the inherent limitation in the selection of biopsy site in previous studies. The presence of epithelialised tunnels is known to impact the gene expression and protein expression in HS samples (Navrazhina et al JACI 2021), and this should be acknowledged as a potential source of heterogeneity.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#160;The manuscript by Johannes Freudenberg et al. describes the transcriptomic signature of skin samples (lesional and perilesional) from 20 patients with HS. The manuscript is well written, the RNA-Seq is appropriate, and the results and discussion are consistent with the analysis reported. A meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptome datasets was also performed, confirming their findings.</p><p>(1) The authors are off to a good start, however, the methodology fails to address how the meta-analysis was performed. The authors should include more information that clarifies and justifies their choice of methods, especially regarding the heterogeneity of the studies. Since the meta-analysis is performed using different datasets (high throughput sequencing that quantifies mRNA short read counts and microarray that analyzes the relative amount of mRNA with a fluorescence scanner) and different controls (HS non-lesional skin and healthy control skin, both of them having different molecular patterns), the authors should provide heterogeneity estimates and demonstrate how they dealt with them. Heterogeneity could be one of the reasons for log2 fold change variance cited at page 7, line 147, "Comparing log2 fold change estimates from individual studies for select genes in the HS disease signature showed considerable variation of fold changes and p-values but taken together, this panel is consistently dysregulated in HS (Figure 3B)". If not possible, avoiding high heterogeneity or changing the analysis method would provide more reliable results.</p><p>(2) I advise the authors to clarify any study heterogeneity as a limitation alongside the others already reported at line 212, page 10.</p><p>(3) In line 145, page 7, the authors state: "We identified 118 protein coding genes that were consistently differentially expressed across HS cohorts and platforms in at least eight of the 11 resulting comparisons". Since the studies were heterogeneous, I suggest the authors highlight the condition of these comparisons, explaining the type of control and array used by them.</p><p>(4) Paraphrasing the authors "several studies have characterized the transcriptomic profile of affected and unaffected skin in small populations" (abstract). The authors reported interesting findings regarding complement activation and bacterial response.

</p><p>Reviewer #1: This is a very interesting work about the molecular disease signature derived from HS patient samples by high-throughput RNA sequencing and meta-analysis of previously reported transcriptomic data sets. This work is well written and organized.</p><p>However, please consider these points:</p><p>1. Page 3, line 48. Please consider this work about HS and Adalimumab mainly focusing on the concept of &#8220;window of opportunity&#8221;: Marzano AV, et al. Evidence for a 'window of opportunity' in hidradenitis suppurativa treated with adalimumab: a retrospective, real-life multicentre cohort study. Br J Dermatol. 2021;184(1):133-140. doi: 10.1111/bjd.18983.</p><p>Commentary and reference has been added.</p><p>2. Page 3, from line 51. Please also consider the involvement of keratinization and autoinflammatory genes such as GJB2, NLRP3 et al. We invite you to consider these works and explore the concept of the polygenic autoinflammatory nature of HS:</p><p>a) Moltrasio C, et al. Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Perspective on Genetic Factors Involved in the Disease. Biomedicines. 2022;10(8):2039. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines10082039.</p><p>b) Marzano AV, et al. Whole-Exome Sequencing in 10 Unrelated Patients with Syndromic Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Preliminary Step for a Genotype-Phenotype Correlation. Dermatology. 2022;238(5):860-869. doi: 10.1159/000521263.</p><p>We have included these references and added these genes to the manuscript.</p><p>3. The table 1 should be expanded. Add other clinical items such as age at diagnosis, age at onset, comorbidities&#8230;</p><p>Comorbidities were not included, but age at diagnosis, symptom onset, mean IHS4, and concomitant medication use are now included in table 1</p><p>Reviewer #2: This paper describes an RNASeq analysis on lesional and non-lesional skin of 20 subjects with HS and a meta-analysis together with the previously published HS transcriptomics studies.</p><p>The authors used a routine method and analyses to strengthen thTe findings on hidradenitis suppurativa biological pathways involved in skin inflammation.</p><p>This study lacks the clinical characterization of the patients analyzed</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>1. The clinical characteristics of the subjects are poorly described. We could imagine the cohort the Authors studied is enriched for severe patients undergoing a surgical procedure to alleviate HS. It is not clear either how these patients were treated before the surgical procedure as these treatments could impact biological pathways found by the RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>We have expanded table one to describe additional clinical characteristics including IHS4 score as a measure of severity and concomitant medications. Those on biologics at the time of tissue collection were intentionally excluded to minimize impact of immunomodulation on expression patterns. Full clinical data will be made publicly available alongside the transcriptome data following publication.</p><p>2. It is not clear to me how the non-lesional area was chosen. It is known that dermal lesions and fistula can be present in the dermis without apparent clinical signs on the skin surface. This could have severely affected the genes and pathways found by the RNA-seq experiment.</p><p>In each of these cases, all involved tissue was carefully examined and probed intraoperatively to delineate the margins of clinically involved tissue. Any non-lesional skin was at least 5 centimeters away and had no apparent inflammatory changes are scarring present. While it is impossible to be certain, we feel highly confident that this skin was not significantly inflamed and acts as a reasonable comparative control. Going further away than this would risk losing site-specific background features of the body region, which would lead to more confusion in interpretation. Comparing skin of the axillae to the lateral trunk or upper arm without the typical follicles or adnexal structures seen in the involved area could lead to many differences in expression that are merely site specific.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Introduction- lines 51 to 54 - not all the genes reported in this paragraph have been associated with HS susceptibility. MyD88 and IL-12r, for instance, have been associated only with HS severity. Please correct this part.</p><p>This is amended to point out that some are related to susceptibility and some to severity</p><p>2. Introduction- lines 54 to 56 - where the measures for these cytokines were done is unclear. Blood? Skin? Lesional vs non-lesional skin? HS patients vs controls? This should be better explained</p><p>This has been added</p><p>Reviewer #3: Thankyou for the opportunity to review this manuscript- A highly novel and insightful piece with high standard statistcal analyses.</p><p>The only discussion point I would add is the inherent limitation in the selection of biopsy site in previous studies. The presence of epithelialised tunnels is known to impact the gene expression and protein expression in HS samples (Navrazhina et al JACI 2021), and this should be acknowledged as a potential source of heterogeneity.</p><p>We have added this commentary in discussion of limitations and included the reference.</p><p>Reviewer #4: The manuscript by Johannes Freudenberg et al. describes the transcriptomic signature of skin samples (lesional and perilesional) from 20 patients with HS. The manuscript is well written, the RNA-Seq is appropriate, and the results and discussion are consistent with the analysis reported. A meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptome datasets was also performed, confirming their findings.</p><p>(1) The authors are off to a good start, however, the methodology fails to address how the meta-analysis was performed. The authors should include more information that clarifies and justifies their choice of methods, especially regarding the heterogeneity of the studies. Since the meta-analysis is performed using different datasets (high throughput sequencing that quantifies mRNA short read counts and microarray that analyzes the relative amount of mRNA with a fluorescence scanner) and different controls (HS non-lesional skin and healthy control skin, both of them having different molecular patterns), the authors should provide heterogeneity estimates and demonstrate how they dealt with them. Heterogeneity could be one of the reasons for log2 fold change variance cited at page 7, line 147, "Comparing log2 fold change estimates from individual studies for select genes in the HS disease signature showed considerable variation of fold changes and p-values but taken together, this panel is consistently dysregulated in HS (Figure 3B)". If not possible, avoiding high heterogeneity or changing the analysis method would provide more reliable results.</p><p>The reviewer raises a great point. We are using a vote-counting procedure [Bushman &amp; Wang] after conducting differential expression analysis within each study individually. We chose this method exactly for the reasons the reviewer pointed out. We have added more detail to the text to clarify the method used.</p><p>(2) I advise the authors to clarify any study heterogeneity as a limitation alongside the others already reported at line 212, page 10.</p><p>Thank you for flagging this. We have added a sentence regarding study heterogeneity to the section as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>(3) In line 145, page 7, the authors state: "We identified 118 protein coding genes that were consistently differentially expressed across HS cohorts and platforms in at least eight of the 11 resulting comparisons". Since the studies were heterogeneous, I suggest the authors highlight the condition of these comparisons, explaining the type of control and array used by them.</p><p>This is again a great point. We have added a statement describing the controls and transcriptomic platforms used.</p><p>&#65533;</p><p>(4) Paraphrasing the authors "several studies have characterized the transcriptomic profile of affected and unaffected skin in small populations" (abstract). The authors reported interesting findings regarding complement activation and bacterial response. Thus, if possible, it would be nice for the authors to provide histopathological data such as immunostaining or immunoblot or even western blot showing these markers variation at the translational level. These correlative analyses would increase the impact of the current manuscript and differentiate it from previous works.</p><p>We agree that this would be and interesting direction for study. We currently have some of this work evaluation complement activation and bacterial response in our labs, but it is currently not ready for publication and likely will be part of a larger and separate project that expands on this work.</p><p>(5) Finally, it appears to me that figure 1 is incomplete. To avoid confusion, the authors should include the images corresponding to the letter B and C into the figure 1 as described on its caption or remove B and C from it.</p><p>Thank you for catching this. We had updated our figures and somehow did not remove the extra information for the caption. Reference to panels B and C have been removed.</p><p>Reviewer #5: This is a well executed study and analysis. My only minor comment is that on Page 9, lines 196-197 data does not quite support the assertion that complement pathways play a driving role. There is dysregulation of the immune response to commensal bacteria, but other pathways may also be involved. This should be edited for clarity.</p><p>This suggestion has been softened with mention that other aspects of the innate immune response may also be players. References have been added for support.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0284047.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0284047.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Simon</surname><given-names initials="M">Michel</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Michel Simon</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Michel Simon</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0284047"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

Due to a high heterogeneity of samples, controls and methodologies of RNA sequencing and annotation included in this study, a rigorous meta-analysis should be performed to avoid bias. Vote counting does not address samples heterogeneity. It is a relatively simple method of knowledge utilization, whereas meta-analysis requires careful explanation of the discretionary steps taken in analysis. Moreover, the vote counting method is not being clarified in the methods section. The technical details should be well explained to ensure that readers understand exactly what has been done.</p><p>Still the group has interesting results, and it would be a pity to not share this information with others that work in the field. Therefore, based on all the points raised, I advise the authors to change the method of analysis. Instead of performing a meta-analysis, the authors could perform a vote counting review of DEGs. This would be an easy solution to address the bias due to heterogeneity, and still find similar results.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

Please clarify and modify within the entire manuscript and figures.</p><p>It would have been better to compare lesional, perilesional and non-lesional sites but it is still good and satisfying work.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This has been modified as non-lesional throughout since all samples described this way were at least 5 cm from a site of inflammation where the lesional biopsy was performed.</p><p>Line 49, please delete &#8220;..&#8221; before the reference 9.</p><p>Done.</p><p>Lines 52-56: in the context of genetic variations underlying HS susceptibility and severity, it is important to mention first the genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity (specifying it) and then the genes involved in keratinization and autoinflammation pathways. The references are adequate, but I suggest to also include this novel manuscript that highlight the potential causative role of AIM2 in hidradenitis suppurativa pathogenesis (in particular of syndromic HS). The manuscript is: &#8220;Moltrasio C, Cagliani R, Sironi M, Clerici M, Pontremoli C, Maronese CA, Tricarico PM, Crovella S, Marzano AV.

Vaccines (Basel). 2023 Jan 11;11(1):162. doi: 10.3390/vaccines11010162&#8221;.</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention as it was published after the most recent draft of our manuscript was completed. We have updated this draft to include it.</p><p>Genes name must be written in italics. In addition, Cx26 is encoded by GJB2. Please write &#8220;GJB2&#8221; gene</p><p>without &#8220;Cx26, GJB2&#8221;.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The sentence at line 54 mentioning connexin-26 is structured to say &#8220;genes encoding subunits of the gamma-secretase complex, connexin-26&#8230;&#8221; Since we are not specifically naming a genes in this sentence and describing encoded proteins we would be mixing up proteins and genes if we particularly described GJB2. We may be understanding this comment incorrectly and are happy to adjust this if additional review is requested or during the proofing process.</p><p>Line 63: Please also consider this recent and interesting work: &#8220;de Oliveira ASLE, Bloise G, Moltrasio C, Coelho A, Agrelli A, Moura R, Tricarico PM, Jamain S, Marzano AV, Crovella S, Cavalcanti Brand&#227;o LA.

Unfortunately, some of them have not been fully addressed. There are still some fundamental concerns with the experimental design and with the analysis that must be revised. This means the strong conclusions put forward by this manuscript are not warranted.</p><p>(1) The authors aim to perform a meta-analysis using HS RNA-Seq publicly available data, however, the method of choice does not fully support this. Due to a high heterogeneity of samples, controls and methodologies of RNA sequencing and annotation included in this study, a rigorous meta-analysis should be performed to avoid bias. Vote counting does not address samples heterogeneity. It is a relatively simple method of knowledge utilization, whereas meta-analysis requires careful explanation of the discretionary steps taken in analysis. Moreover, the vote counting method is not being clarified in the methods section. The technical details should be well explained to ensure that readers understand exactly what has been done.</p><p>We are concerned that a &#8220;rigorous meta-analysis&#8221; would be more challenging than suggested with this type of data since we are aiming to jointly analyze both microarrays which measure probe intensities on an arbitrary scale and RNA-Seq datasets which count the number of observed transcripts. To establish the right statistical methods to jointly model such divergent data types without introducing new biases is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To nevertheless address the reviewer&#8217;s concerns we have decided to remove any reference to the term &#8220;meta-analysis&#8221; since the method we used is a meta-analysis in broad sense and could be interpreted as misleading. In addition, we have added two sentences to the discussion (line 145) reflecting the reviewer&#8217;s point regarding the limitations (line 222) of the vote counting method and we have updated the methods section (line 299) to describe how the HS signature was determined.</p><p>Still the group has interesting results, and it would be a pity to not share this information with others that work in the field. Therefore, based on all the points raised, I advise the authors to change the method of analysis. Instead of performing a meta-analysis, the authors could perform a vote counting review of DEGs. This would be an easy solution to address the bias due to heterogeneity, and still find similar results.</p><p>We hope this concern has been adequately addressed with changes discussed in the previous comment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0284047.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0284047.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Simon</surname><given-names initials="M">Michel</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Michel Simon</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Michel Simon</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0284047" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
