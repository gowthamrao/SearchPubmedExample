Over time, consistent unhealthy drinking may lead to physiological changes in regions of the brain and the development of alcohol dependence (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Levey <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the associated high level of disease burden, it has been estimated that only 10% of European patients with alcohol dependence receive the treatment they need (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Rehm <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Mann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). It has been argued that offering a treatment strategy able to better meet the patients&#8217; preferences and needs may reduce this treatment gap by increasing treatment seeking in people with an alcohol use disorder (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Luquiens and Aubin, 2014</xref>). More broadly, new avenues of success are to be found in the development of personalized treatment approaches aiming at improving patient matching with medications (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Litten <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Witkiewitz <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). In 2015, the French Alcohol Society updated their guidelines to reflect the needs of the modern day French addiction care system. The revised guidelines recognized that total abstinence may not be an achievable aim for many patients and recommended that reduction of alcohol consumption can be considered as an alternative approach to reducing negative consequences in people with alcohol dependence (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Rolland <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2016</xref>).</p><p>Nalmefene (Selincro<sup>&#174;</sup>, H. Lundbeck A/S, Valby, Denmark) is an opioid system modulator licensed in Europe and Japan for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence who have a high drinking risk level (high DRL is defined as alcohol consumption &gt;60&#160;g/day for men and &gt;40&#160;g/day for women), without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification. It was the first drug to receive regulatory approval for the indication of reducing drinking in alcohol-dependent individuals and the updated French guidelines recommended nalmefene as the first-line medication for reducing alcohol consumption in people with alcohol dependence (grade A) (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Rolland <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). Regulatory approval of nalmefene in Europe was based on the results of phase III clinical trials, which consistently demonstrated that nalmefene, given to alcohol dependent patients with a high DRL, on an as-needed basis and together with psychosocial support, reduces the total amount of alcohol consumption (TAC) and number of heavy drinking days (HDDs) (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Mann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, following European approval, additional data were required by the French Health Technology Assessment agency (HAS, Haute Autorit&#233; de Sant&#233;) to inform on the real-world effectiveness and safety of nalmefene as given in routine practice in France.</p><p>We aimed to document the &#8216;real-life&#8217; use of nalmefene and evaluate its impact on alcohol use health status.

The protocol received all legal approvals and authorizations from the national medical committee (Conseil National de l&#8217;Ordre des M&#233;decins, CNOM), the data-protection committee for biomedical research (Comit&#233; Consultatif sur le Traitement de l&#8217;Information en mati&#232;re de Recherche dans le domaine de la Sant&#233;, CCTIRS) and the national data-protection authority (Commission Nationale de l&#8217;Informatique et des Libert&#233;s, CNIL).</p><p>The study was conducted in a random sample of French prescribers. The prescribing physician sample included general practitioners, psychiatrists and physicians practicing within an addiction specialist setting. The main inclusion criteria required patients to be consenting adults &#8805;18&#160;years who were starting treatment with nalmefene. Patients should not have been included in another study likely to modify their management, and they should not have been under guardianship.</p><p>Data were collected via standardized paper questionnaires completed by the investigators and patients. At baseline, the physicians had to complete an inclusion questionnaire documenting: general patient characteristics, disease history, alcohol consumption as assessed by TAC, number of HDDs and DRL according to the WHO classification (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">EMA, 2010</xref>). In addition, physicians provided a review of the consultation, including alcohol consumption target, associated treatments and date of the next consultation. Patients attended visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#160;months, and at each visit, physicians completed follow-up questionnaires documenting nalmefene treatment, consultations that had taken place since the last visit, laboratory workup, clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Forkmann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2011</xref>), alcohol consumption. When liver function tests were recorded, analyzed variables included &#947;-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Investigators also documented any adverse events.</p><p>Patients also completed a series of self-assessment questionnaires at each visit, including patient-rated quality of the psychosocial follow-up and global impression (CGI-P) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Forkmann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). Impact on quality of life was evaluated with the Alcohol Quality of Life Scale (AQoLS) (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Luquiens <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2016</xref>) and EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">EuroQol, 1990</xref>), and functional impact was evaluated using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 1996</xref>). Best efforts were made to collect data on patients who were &#8216;lost to follow-up at 12 months&#8217;, firstly via a telephone interview with the patient or, failing that, with their attending physician.</p><p>For the USE-PACT study, we estimated that a sample size of 600 patients was needed to obtain precision of &#177;5% for the relative variation in TAC, with a standard deviation of 63% and 95% confidence intervals. Assuming a dropout rate of 40%, a total of 1000 patients were required for recruitment. All statistical analyses performed were descriptive in nature. In order to understand the impact of treatment in different treatment groups, we also assessed results of TAC and HDDs by DRL at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>USE-AM study design</title><p>USE-AM was performed as a cohort study in a healthcare reimbursement database based on data from the National Health Data System (SNDS) in France. The SNDS database links claims, with hospital-discharge summaries (PMSI) and the national death registry, using pseudonymization of the unique national identifier. It currently includes 98.8% of the French population (i.e. more than 66 million people from birth/immigration) until their death/emigration) (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bezin <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). The Echantillon G&#233;n&#233;raliste de B&#233;n&#233;ficiaires (EGB) is a permanent representative sample of the SNDS, which includes currently about 700,000 beneficiaries whether or not they have received reimbursement of care.

Access to SNDS was approved by the national data protection authority (CNIL) after advice from a committee on healthcare data research (CEREES).</p><p>The USE-AM study included adult (&#8805;18&#160;years old) patients from the EGB sample who have had a first dispensing of nalmefene over a period of 1 year, between the 1 January and 31 December 2016. Patients should have had &#8805;2&#160;years of history in the database, and &#8805;1&#160;year of follow-up (i.e. coverage in the database). The time of follow-up was set at 1&#160;year after index date (day of first nalmefene dispensing). For each patient in the study population, the following data were extracted: EGB affiliation history, socio-demographic data, long-term medical condition data occurring up to the index date (along with ICD-10 codes, and start and end date); drug dispensations between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2016; consultations and medical visits carried out between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2016 (completion date, physician specialty).

Treatment was generally well tolerated, adverse events showing a profile similar to that observed in clinical trials (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Mann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the USE-PACT study, the reductions in TAC and HDDs followed a similar time course as seen in the pivotal studies (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Mann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2014</xref>), and in particular, the ESENSE 2 trial, which included patients from France (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). While baseline alcohol consumption was somewhat lower than in the pivotal studies (65 vs. 92&#160;g/day in ESENSE 2), we observed a similar magnitude of reduction (~64% in USE-PACT vs. ~68% reduction in TAC in the ESENSE 2 nalmefene group). Also consistent with clinical trial results, the reduction in TAC and HDDs at 6&#160;months and at 1 year was more pronounced in patients with a high/very high heavy drinking risk on starting nalmefene (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). This corresponds to the approved indication of nalmefene use. While it appears that almost half of patients had a medium or low risk DRL at baseline (nalmefene is indicated for patients with high DRL), this discrepancy may be partly explained by the fact that USE-PACT patients had already come in to see their physician for treatment and may already have reduced their consumption from earlier levels. In the ESENSE 2 trial, 33% of patients had reduced their drinking prior to start of treatment, before any intervention (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>Prescription patterns for nalmefene showed that many patients discontinue treatment over the course of 1 year. In particular, a significant proportion of patients in the USE-PACT study discontinued after only a couple of months&#8212;while remaining in the study follow-up. It is the authors&#8217; clinical experience that there are several potential reasons for discontinuation. The early experience of adverse events, such as dizziness or nausea, which are usually mild to moderate and transient (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2014</xref>), can be off-putting to the unprepared patient and prevent them from persevering with treatment. A small proportion of patients weary of taking any drug after some time, and some patients, although wishing to reduce (but not stop) their drinking report that they avoid the treatment because it prevents them to the pleasurable experience of intoxication. Finally, nalmefene is to be taken &#8216;as needed&#8217;, which may make it easier to forget versus a specific schedule for patients to follow. In USE-AM, where virtually all patients stopped treatment during 1&#160;year of follow-up, the initial prescription of nalmefene was more commonly made by GPs, followed by doctors practising in hospital facilities (of unknown specialty) and psychiatrists. The longer use in the USE-PACT study (48% of patients were still on treatment at 12&#160;months) may be due to (a) the higher proportion of patients treated in a specialist setting and (b) a greater incentive to remain on treatment during a formal, albeit observational, study.</p><p>The safety and tolerability profile of nalmefene was in line with previous trial reports and known profile (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gual <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Mann <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and no new safety concerns were identified. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and insomnia, which are expected with opioid antagonism and were predominantly mild to moderate and transient. As discussed above, it is useful for patients to know that nausea and dizziness tend to occur within 1 day after the first dose and are generally of short duration (around 3&#160;days) (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). In the pivotal studies, recurrence of these frequent events was not related to the pattern of study medication intake, and there was no difference in safety for the patients when nalmefene was taken daily or intermittently (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). In these real-world studies, rates of death were slightly higher than seen in the pivotal trials, but were in line with overall mortality rates in alcohol-dependent patients (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Duberq <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2020</xref>). The deaths were not considered related to nalmefene treatment in this study; there was one suicide recorded in the USE-PACT study, which was in the context of an emotionally unstable patient during a family conflict while intoxicated with alcohol. In the pivotal trials, there were no completed suicides in patients receiving nalmefene, but two patients receiving placebo committed suicide (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">van den Brink <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p>In real-world studies, it is always a matter of discussion if participating practices and/or the included patients are truly representative for the patients actually treated in the respective health care system, or if selection bias may have influenced the results. Our dual-study approach allowed the comparison of the USE-PACT study with national healthcare data in the USE-AM study that is, by definition, not subject to selection bias. Patient characteristics were similar in both studies, thereby supporting the external validity of the prospective study. In the USE-AM study, the proportion of prescribers practicing in a hospital facility were lower compared to the USE-PACT study, which may also explain the slightly higher proportion of patients with complex co-morbidities and prior pharmacological treatment for alcohol in the USE-PACT study. However, coding systems were not the same for the two studies. In the USE-AM study, coding for type of physician was performed (by the dispensing pharmacists) according to the prescription, which could lead to doctors from a specialist facility being classified in the &#8216;hospital doctor (specialty unknown)&#8217; group, or as general practitioners. In the USE-PACT study, the coding is based on the statement made by the doctor in the participation form. Likewise, comorbidities in USE-AM were limited to those classified as long-term disease registrations and it is notable that rates of current concomitant medications were more similar between the two studies. It should be noted, however, that our findings are somewhat specific to the French healthcare system, and therefore may not be fully generalizable in other countries. In particular, nalmefene (like other approved medications for alcohol use disorder) is reimbursed in France.</p><p>Although limited by missing data, results of the liver function tests, and patient reported measures of global function and quality of life show the relevance of reduced alcohol consumption in real-life practice. Other limitations included the lack of a control group and those inherent to observational studies such as the high loss to follow-up despite best attempts to keep these patients in the study. Unfortunately, difficulties in recruitment prevented us from reaching the target 1000 patients in the USE-PACT study. Since the prospective study was an uncontrolled observational trial, it is not possible to infer the role of nalmefene in patients&#8217; improvements. Other factors such as therapeutic settings, psychosocial support, patient&#8217;s expectancies and regression to the mean (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Rutherford and Roose, 2013</xref>) are likely to have impacted our observations. One should also keep in mind that, in this real-world study, a number of patients take other medications&#8212;for their alcohol use disorder as for comorbidities&#8212;that can interact with nalmefene in various ways. However, nalmefene is considered a relatively safe drug for co-administration, with the exception of opioid agonists (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Guerzoni <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2018</xref>).</p><p>This real-world study included patients being treated as per routine practice, and we do not know if patients had previously followed a detoxification treatment. However, nalmefene should not be used in patients requiring immediate detoxification (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Selincro SmPC, 2018</xref>). While nalmefene is the only medication specially developed for alcohol reduction (as opposed to relapse prevention), naltrexone remains a possible alternative, as it has shown some efficacy in reducing alcohol drinking in heavy drinkers (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Kranzler <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). An indirect comparison meta-analysis of these two drugs concluded that nalmefene may be more effective than naltrexone (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Soyka <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2016</xref>), although whether a clinically relevant difference between the two medications really exists is still an open question. Side effects of nalmefene seem similar to naltrexone (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Witkiewitz <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.,</italic> 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in this routine practice study in France, patients with alcohol dependence treated with nalmefene, taken as needed, showed reduced alcohol consumption, and nalmefene was generally well tolerated. Substantial proportions of patients discontinued treatment over the 1-year follow-up periods. Nevertheless, the favourable results observed in USE-PACT in terms of alcohol consumption indicate that the actual level of nalmefene exposure in the study was sufficient to reach the observed effect in terms of drinking level reduction. These data form a vital part of the nalmefene post-launch risk management plan and provide important information for health authorities and payers.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the interpretation of the data, provided critical review of the manuscript and approved the manuscript for submission.
