We propose an integrated approach for screening/diagnostic testing and treatment in 6,665 Viennese PWIDs registered to access opioid agonist therapy (OAT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>OAT prescriptions were required monthly at one of nine approved authorities, making them ideal platforms for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening. All PWIDs attending these authorities between January 2019 and March 2020 were offered on-site HCV screening, and consecutive HCV RNA PCR in case of positive HCV serology. In HCV viremic PWIDs, offsite referral to HCV care and treatment according to directly observed therapy (DOT) alongside OAT were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>4,327/6,665 (64.9%) individuals were contacted before the COVID-19-related project discontinuation. There were 1,538/4,327 (35.5%) individuals who had participated in the study. HCV serology was available in 1,510/1,538 (98.2%): 795/1,519 (52.6%) had a positive serology, among whom 632 (79.5%) were followed-up with a PCR test. In 8/1,538 (0.5%) additional study participants HCV RNA PCR was assessed without prior serological screening. 239/640 (37.3%) individuals were HCV viremic with 51 (21.3%) having started on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). 48/51 (94.1%) had completed treatment, among whom 42 (87.5% according to ITT) had achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after completing treatment (SVR12) and 6 (12.5%) had been lost to follow-up after completion of therapy (SVR12 according to mITT: 42/42, 100%). No treatment failures had occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Providing integrated point-of-care HCV screening/diagnostic testing at central OAT approved centers, followed by DOT with DAAs, represents an effective HCV microelimination strategy. While some PWIDs were lost in the cascade to cure and the absolute number of SVR was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic, our approach will allow linkage to care in a large proportion of Viennese

The low-threshold institution involved in this project is a multidisciplinary facility offering integrated medical care, social services, temporary housing, and a syringe-exchange service for PWIDs in Vienna ("Suchthilfe Wien"). OAT must typically be ingested under the supervision of the pharmaceutical or healthcare staff at the pharmacy or at the low-threshold institution, ensuring that OAT is taken by the authorized PWIDs and not used for intravenous injection or sold on the streets (i.e., "directly observed therapy", DOT).</p><p id="p0145">Patient evaluation for and inclusion into the OAT program as well as OAT prescriptions are conducted by addiction medicine specialists.

The hepatitis clinic is operated by an experienced hepatologist from the Klinik Ottakring, a Viennese tertiary care center authorized for the treatment of HCV and prescription of DAAs.

Furthermore, hepatitits B (HBV) unvaccinated individuals were informed about the recommendation to undergo HBV immunization and received counseling on where this service was provided (e.g. family doctor, outpatient clinics).

Depending on previous adherence to OAT, expected adherence to DAA, socio-economic status (importantly including availability of stable housing), and health insurance coverage as assessed by the study team on-site, PWIDs with good adherence and those who were in a stable socio-economic situation were preferably assigned to the tertiary care center while those with expected high risk of non-adherence and those who were in a more precarious socio-economic situation were preferably assigned to the low-threshold facility. Of note, all PWIDs were seen by the same experienced hepatologist independent of the institution they were referred to, and pretreatment evaluation did not differ between the tertiary care center and the low-threshold facility. Both institutions are located within the city of Vienna and can be reached easily using the accessible, reliable, and affordable urban public transportation system, hence transportation was not provided during the project. Diagnostic testing, pretreatment workup and DAA treatment were performed according to current guidelines using only licensed pharmacological substances; no financial compensation was provided for PWIDs undergoing HCV testing and/or DAA treatment in this project. However, HCV testing as well as DAA treatment and follow-up visits were provided free-of charge for individuals lacking health insurance coverage at the time of this initiative.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Pretreatment workup</title><p id="p0180">Pretreatment evaluation included medical history (including alcohol consumption habits and ongoing IDU [defined as one or more injections within the three months preceding the evaluation]), socio-economic status (relationship, housing and employment status, criminal record), physical examination, abdominal sonography, standard laboratory testing, serum HCV RNA quantification, HCV genotype (GT), HIV antibody screening, HBV serology (HBsAg, antiHBs, antiHBc), and liver fibrosis stage assessment via transient elastography (TE) fibroscan.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The applied methods were described in detail in a previous publication from our group.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Antiviral therapy</title><p id="p0185">PWIDs received a fixed-dose combination treatment with either SOF/VEL (400&#160;mg sofosbuvir and 100&#160;mg velpatasvir once daily for 12 weeks) or with G/P (100&#160;mg glecaprevir and 40&#160;mg pibrentasvir, three tablets once daily for 8 weeks, administered with food) according to the drug label.

The PWIDs in whom advanced fibrosis or HBV coinfection were detected received counseling on further treatment and surveillance implications, e.g. the necessity of biennial screening for hepatocellular carcinoma via abdominal sonography in cirrhosis and in HBV coinfection, and the recommendation of HBV treatment evaluation via a tertiary care center on a regular basis in HBV coinfection. All individuals received an index sonography and standard laboratory evaluation during the pretreatment workup at the low-threshold facility, and in cases with evident indications for pharmacotherapy, e.g. diuretic treatment in decompensated cirrhosis, the respective prescriptions were made during the pretreatment evaluation visit at the low-threshold facility.

However, it must be acknowledged that these calculations likely represent an underestimation of the real HCV prevalence as 163 (10.6%) individuals with positive HCV serology declined confirmatory HCV RNA PCR testing. This drop-off in diagnostic testing owing to our two-step screening approach may be overcome by reflex testing, providing the possibility to perform HCV RNA PCR from the same sample that was used for HCV antibody screening.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> However, single-step reflex testing requires taking a blood sample in every individual, while the easy and convenient approach of saliva-based antibody screening followed by point-of-care confirmatory HCV RNA PCR that was used in our project represents a major strength of this study.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Among 1,510 PWIDs who underwent HCV serology screening, we found an HCV seropositivity prevalence of 52.6%, which is higher than the positive HCV antibody prevalence of 42.2% discovered through a similar project performed among PWIDs in Southern Italy in 2019.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Yet of note, the prevalence of HCV viremia was significantly lower among our study population at 37.3% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) as compared to 70.2% among the Italian cohort.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> On the one hand, this finding may be a reflection of the geographical differences in HCV prevalence, which was estimated to be higher in Italy than in Austria with 1% versus 0.2% of the national populations, respectively, in 2020.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> On the other hand, ongoing HCV elimination efforts aimed specifically at PWIDs in Vienna may have led to these substantial differences in HCV viremia prevalence.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Interestingly, a recent study from Australia, who is currently on track to meeting the WHO requirements for HCV elimination by 2030, found HCV viremia rates of 50% among PWIDs with low socio-economic status who were screened for HCV in a point-of-care setting, however, these results may be influenced by a smaller sample size.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Importantly, 65 (27.2%) PWIDs who were found to be HCV viremic in our study reported having never been tested for HCV before, which is lower than in the Italian cohort where 48.1% were newly diagnosed.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Overall, 163 (68.2%) of the 239 HCV RNA(+) identified in our study were unaware of their HCV viremia.

While Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien is a low-threshold institution aiming to overcome barriers to treatment for PWIDs and pretreatment evaluation was performed in a single visit there, the geographical change from the substitution approval center to the low-threshold facility alone represents an obstacle in the cascade to HCV cure, which, hence, underlines the need for further decentralization and integration of HCV care in the everyday routine of PWIDs. However, pretreatment evaluation did not lead to any cases of loss to FU in our study. Of note, among the Australian cohort, a similar SVR rate of 21% of HCV viremic individuals was found as compared to our data.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p><p id="p0320">Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly interfered with the realization of this project, as only 6 of the total 8 awarding authorities could be investigated. Additionally, social distancing and official governmental restrictions specifically impaired linkage to care in our cohort, which may in part explain the low percentage of treatment initiations among the HCV viremic population. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are, however, impacting HCV elimination programs all over the world, and will have to be acknowledged upon the assessment of all global HCV elimination efforts towards the WHO goal.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Nevertheless, it is to be taken into consideration that the population investigated in this study represents a very difficult-to-reach cohort that has so far escaped all previous HCV elimination initiatives in Vienna.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Therefore, linkage to care can be expected to be specifically challenging and may require repeated recalls and/or the implementation of additional services, like for example a peer-based support program, which was shown to be effective in previous studies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> To close existing gaps - including those provoked by linkage to offsite care - in the HCV elimination cascade for PWIDs, embedding screening and treatment in an established OAT program was shown to be highly effective.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that the Austrian regulation of exclusively tertiary care-mediated DAA prescription represents one of the most relevant obstacles in HCV care for PWIDs. While in this project as well as in previous HCV elimination efforts performed by our group<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> the regulation was overcome by outsourcing an outpatient hepatitis clinic affiliated with a tertiary care center authorized to prescribe DAA at a low threshold facility, enabling a broader spectrum of healthcare providers. Low threshold facilities to provide DAA treatment prescriptions still remains to be achieved in Austria.</p><p id="p0325">We believe that our study provides a new approach to overcome the barriers to HCV screening/diagnostic testing in Viennese PWIDs. Performing HCV screening/diagnostic testing in a point-of-care setting at the awarding authorities incorporated into the OAT program has facilitated the comprehensive delivery of HCV care to PWIDs who may otherwise never have attended an HCV screening/diagnostic testing institution. Overall, we have engaged a large population at risk of HCV infection in the screening/diagnostic testing process and combined screening/diagnostic testing with the established approach of DOT/modified DOT with DAA to accommodate the needs of PWIDs. Importantly, adherence to DOT/modified DOT was excellent with only 0.2% of the scheduled ingestions being missed by our treated individuals, which led to an aliquot extension of treatment duration in the respective cases.</p><p id="p0330">However, our study also has some limitations. First, only 1,538 (23.1%) of the total 6,665 PWIDs eligible for screening could be included, which was due to the shortened study duration for external reasons, and due to the high rate of PWIDs who declined participation in the project. The initial characterization of the included population is very basic (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which, however, goes in line with the concept of the project, delivering low-barrier HCV care in a point-of-care setting, and which can be intensified during the pretreatment workup. Second, linkage to care remains low with 21.3% of HCV viremic patients having started DAA therapy. Originally, linkage to care was greatly impaired by COVID-19-associated restrictions but is currently being actively pursued, hence we expect an ongoing increase in treatment initiations. Third, considering that we did not observe any HCV reinfections during FU, it must be pointed out that enforcement of the recommended intervals for HCV RNA PCR-FU was not subject to this project, and as adherence to long-term appointments remains problematic among PWIDs as elaborated in this manuscript, we cannot provide data from standardized assessment points. Therefore, intercurrent HCV reinfection and spontaneous clearance cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, 31/48 (64.6%) PWIDs who achieved SVR12 had FU HCV RNA PCR tests performed between week 13 and 115 after the end of treatment, which represents a considerable rate of FU testing given the fact that all individuals included in this project were of low socioeconomic status and considered at risk for non-adherence to medical therapy, as represented by the high percentage of daily OAT dispensation among our study population. A fourth limitation of this project is that women represented a rather low percentage (21.6% female vs. 78.4% male DAA recipients) among the treated population. As this distribution mirrors the sex distribution documented among the overall PWID population enrolled in the Viennese OAT program, we do not believe that women suffered from a gender-specific disadvantage in this particular project.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> However, this finding draws attention to the fact that the incidence of HCV among young women marks a change in epidemiology in some parts of the world, and especially women with a history of IDU and/or on OAT may experience risk factors specific to this subpopulation that may have been overlooked so far (e.g. partnership with an older male, being in a relationship with a man who injects drugs, having to exchange sex for drugs to help a male partner obtain drugs, childcare and eldercare responsibilities with lack of childcare at medical appointments/inability to bring children to OAT dispensing visits, etc.).<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Especially for female PWIDs of childbearing age, this deficiency in targeted HCV care implies a potential risk for vertical transmission that may consecutively be overlooked.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> In Austria, vertical infectious disease transmission, namely concerning HIV and HBV, has been effectively targeted through a universal national screening program for pregnant women.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Hence, adding HCV screening to this existing program would be a feasible first step in including this often overlooked but vulnerable population in targeted HCV care.</p><p id="p0335">While there are some promising strategies to increase linkage to care in previously diagnosed HCV viremic PWIDs,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> screening/diagnostic testing in those who declined to take part in low-threshold projects like this will remain a challenge. One option may be the implementation of "opt-out" screening/single-step diagnostic testing scenarios as part of harm reduction services,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> however, a small population of PWIDs - especially those who are not integrated in any systematic programs such as OAT or who do not use services such as syringe exchange - may currently not be able to get treated.</p><p id="p0340">In conclusion, this tailored approach to screening/diagnostic testing and treatment for HCV in Viennese PWIDs was an effective measure to include a population who may otherwise not have been diagnosed. Given the high rate of ongoing IDU among this population, targeted strategies to increase diagnosis rate and treatment receipt are key to avoid further HCV transmission and progressive liver disease. In the absence of an effective HCV vaccine, the combination of OAT, DAA, and harm reduction as applied in this project will be key to facilitate HCV elimination among PWIDs. Our project supports the integration of HCV screening and treatment into preexisting services for PWIDs, which may be transferable to other regions nationally and internationally in the context of HCV elimination.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Financial support</title><p id="p0345">This study was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Gilead</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0350">Schwarz C.
