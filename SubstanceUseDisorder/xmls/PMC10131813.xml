However, awareness of this risk remains low. National breast screening programs are uniquely positioned to provide timely and targeted health information and behavior change strategies to improve alcohol literacy and reduce consumption. A breast screening service is a novel health care setting for brief alcohol intervention, with the potential for extensive reach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>This study aimed to conduct a formative evaluation with breast screening service consumers to understand the need for, and acceptability of, brief alcohol intervention in the breast screening setting and collaboratively design a brief alcohol intervention (Health4Her); to test the effectiveness of Health4Her in improving knowledge of alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor (primary outcome), improving alcohol literacy, and reducing consumption among women attending a breast screening service; and to examine the implementation strategy through process evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial comprising a randomized controlled trial (RCT) alongside a mixed methods program evaluation guided by applicable elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Formative evaluation comprised a retrospective analysis of alcohol consumption data (n=49,240), a web-based survey (n=391), and focus groups and interviews (n=31) with breast screening service consumers. Women attending routine mammography, drinking at any level, were recruited to the single-site, double-blind RCT (n=558), and completed a baseline assessment before randomization (1:1) to receive Health4Her (alcohol brief intervention + lifestyle information) or control (lifestyle information) via animation on an iPad. Follow-up assessments were performed 4 and 12 weeks after randomization. The process evaluation included evaluation of trial administrative data, participant quantitative (n=497) and qualitative feedback (n=30), and site staff qualitative feedback (n=11).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This research was funded in March and May 2019.

Meta-analyses demonstrate a dose-response relationship between alcohol and breast cancer [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with the relative risk of breast cancer increasing by 4%, 23%, and 61% for light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption, respectively [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lifetime and current alcohol consumption have been found to contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, alcohol consumption after the age of 40 years is strongly and independently associated with breast cancer risk [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among women with a history of breast cancer, alcohol intake of &lt;1 standard drink per day has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence or development of a second primary breast cancer [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Despite strong evidence, awareness of the alcohol&#8211;breast cancer link has remained surprisingly low [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; recent Australian and international estimates indicate that only 16% to 20% of the population accurately identifies alcohol consumption as a risk factor for breast cancer [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Australia, per capita alcohol consumption is declining [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; however, risky alcohol consumption (based on 2009 Australian Alcohol Guidelines, consuming &gt;2 Australian standard drinks per day) has remained stable among women aged &#8805;40 years and has even increased among women aged between 50 and 69 years [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study of Australian women with newly diagnosed first episode of invasive breast cancer found that the proportion of women drinking at the time of diagnosis and 2 years after diagnosis remained stable at 71%, with 1 in 6 women continuing to drink in excess of the national alcohol guidelines that were in place at the time (ie, &gt;2 standard drinks per drinking day) after breast cancer diagnosis [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite this, alcohol consumption among middle- to older-age individuals is often underrecognized as an area of concern [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has largely been absent from breast cancer prevention strategies and health promotion.</p><p>Internationally, computerized brief alcohol interventions (ie, feedback on personal drinking levels compared with age and gender norms, alongside information about alcohol risks and harms) have received strong empirical support as a simple, cost-effective method of addressing alcohol consumption and reducing related harm in primary care populations [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Computerized brief alcohol interventions offer a low-cost, labor- and time-efficient approach that has the potential to overcome some of the issues with implementation in busy health care environments [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Meta-analyses show that a single computerized intervention session is effective in reducing alcohol consumption and improving health-related knowledge, attitudes, and intentions [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and has the potential for wide reach.</p><p>Population-based screening programs can provide a window of opportunity to receive relevant targeted health information. Approximately 43 million women participate in population breast screening programs annually in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. An intervention offered within an already established national breast screening program, which could provide information on alcohol and breast cancer risk alongside behavioral change strategies, has the potential to improve women&#8217;s alcohol literacy, reduce alcohol consumption, and have extensive reach. Some recent research suggests that integrating brief alcohol interventions into breast screening services is perceived by clients as acceptable [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; however, the effectiveness of such an approach is yet to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The aims of this research were to (1) conduct a formative evaluation with breast screening service consumers to understand the need for, and acceptability of brief alcohol intervention in the breast screening setting and collaboratively design a brief alcohol intervention (Health4Her) with women in this setting; (2) test the effectiveness of Health4Her in improving knowledge of alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor (primary outcome), improving alcohol literacy, and reducing consumption among women attending a breast screening service; and (3) examine the implementation strategy through process evaluation to accelerate the translation of this research into practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] comprising a randomized controlled trial (RCT) alongside a mixed methods program evaluation (<xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), guided by applicable elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A mixed methods quantitative and qualitative formative evaluation comprised a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional alcohol consumption data from a large sample of breast screening service consumers, a web-based survey, and focus groups and interviews with subsets of breast screening service consumers. The single-site, parallel group, double-blind RCT was designed to evaluate whether the Health4Her intervention is effective in improving knowledge of alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor, improving alcohol literacy, and reducing consumption among women attending a breast screening service. A mixed methods quantitative and qualitative process evaluation examined the implementation strategy via the evaluation of trial and site administrative data, quantitative and qualitative feedback from trial participants, and qualitative feedback from breast screening site staff.

To collect qualitative data from breast screening service consumers, focus groups were initially conducted on-site and replaced with telephonic interviews conducted from the end of March 2020 to comply with social distancing requirements owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The first component of the formative evaluation comprised a retrospective analysis of deidentified cross-sectional alcohol and sociodemographic data (collected from May 2010 to November 2019) from 49,240 women who are members of Lifepool [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a large convenience sample of women living in Victoria, Australia, who are recruited predominantly through the state-wide BreastScreen program. For the web-based survey, 391 participants were recruited through an email invitation circulated to randomly sampled batches of Lifepool members, stratified by age, based on an anticipated response rate of 25% (total invitations e-mailed, n=1412). Women who participated in the web-based survey and were living in the Melbourne region were invited to register for participation in a focus group or interview at the end of the survey. In addition, purposive sampling was employed to recruit women living in the Melbourne region who reported drinking 3 to 4 (or more) standard drinks, 3 to 4 (or more) days per week (based on the data collected at cohort entry), to participate in a focus group or interview (additional invitations, n=199; focus group or interview participation, n=31). As with all components of this study, women with or without a history of breast cancer were able to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>For the retrospective analysis of Lifepool data, there were data available on participants&#8217; typical and heavy alcohol consumption patterns over the previous 12 months (eg, <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;</italic>In the last 12 months, how often did you have an alcoholic drink of any kind?&#8221; and &#8220;In the past 12 months, how often have you had more than 4 standard drinks in a day?&#8221;) [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group at a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization used standard computer-generated permuted blocks of a variable-size scheme. A randomization list was generated at the start of the study by a data scientist and linked to a unique identification code. The data scientist generating the random allocation sequence played no other role in the study. The study was described as a trial of two types of women&#8217;s health promotion that minimized the trial&#8217;s alcohol focus and concealed allocation to the intervention arm. Researcher 1, who administered the corresponding intervention per a priori generated randomization list, was not blinded to trial allocation. Researcher 2, who performed the 4- and 12-week telephone assessments, was blinded to trial allocation throughout trial data collection and may only have been unblinded once quantitative program implementation evaluation feedback was sought from trial participants before closing the 12-week call (ie, data collection that did not require blinding). Given the nature and content of the intervention and the outcome assessments, emergency unblinding procedures were deemed unnecessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Interventions were delivered on an iPad using a prototype of a brief eHealth intervention (ie, researcher-administered screening alcohol questions, intervention administered by the researcher for the participant to view alone).

Take-home study-branded earphones were provided to each participant to view the animation privately.

As such, lifestyle information in the control condition was also provided in the intervention condition. This also served to maintain equivalence across the treatment conditions.

A description of the trial schedule of the assessments can be found in <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. An electronic case report form was completed for each participant using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], hosted on a secure server and managed by Eastern Health IT Services with individual access via a secure login, and accessible only to approved members of the research team. REDCap stored screening and trial data, as well as identifiable data, including participant names and contact information. Identifiers were flagged in REDCap to provide additional protection for these data during data exports (ie, identifiers were automatically removed from all exported material generated by REDCap). Spreadsheets containing reidentifiable information (ie, for the purpose of conducting follow-up assessments; timeline follow-back data, which could not be collected using REDCap) were protected with unique passwords. Hardcopy data were stored and secured in a locked cabinet on-site at Turning Point. Upon completion of trial data collection, data were transferred from the electronic case report form and other source documents (eg, timeline follow-back spreadsheets) to Stata and R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) packages for analyses. Protected health information (ie, participant name and contact information) was not exported. All data collected during this study will be retained by the research team for at least 5 years, as outlined in the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research.</p></sec><sec><title>Power and Sample Size</title><p>Power and sample size estimates were carried out using PS: Power and Sample Size Calculation (version 3.1.2; Vanderbilt University) [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], assuming a type 1 error probability of &lt;.05, 2-tailed, and equal-sized groups. Power calculations were based on the primary end point and the change in the proportion of participants who accurately identified alcohol as a clear risk factor for breast cancer. On the basis of the data from our web-based survey of breast screening service consumers (n=391) conducted as part of the study&#8217;s formative evaluation, the proportion of participants identifying alcohol as a clear risk factor for breast cancer at baseline was estimated to be 22%. On the basis of a related study examining the effects of a public health campaign on awareness of the alcohol-breast cancer link [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the response rate for participants receiving an alcohol brief intervention was estimated to be &#8805;12% greater at 34% at 4 weeks postrandomization. Accounting for 20% attrition at the follow-up, a sample of at least 548 participants (274 per arm) was estimated to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis Plan</title><p>Data were collated, cleaned, and validated in a database that was locked before analysis. No interim analyses were planned to be conducted, and as no substantial harm was anticipated from this trial, no formal stopping guidelines were specified. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, with the &#945; level set at .05, and analyses were conducted using the most appropriate procedures in Stata or R All randomized participants were included in the analyses (ie, intention-to-treat) for primary and secondary outcomes. Sociodemographic characteristics will be summarized and reported by intervention arm. Analyses examined change in outcomes over time (4 weeks, 12 weeks, or 4 and 12 weeks; pre-specified for each outcome) relative to baseline. The Generalized Linear Mixed Model approach with fixed effects for treatment and time, their interaction, and random effects for subjects and assessments within subjects was applied to examine the treatment effect of the intervention on all outcomes. For outcomes assessed at a single postrandomization time point, the models were equivalent to traditional logistic regression. For consumption outcomes, subgroup analyses were conducted with participants exceeding national guidelines for weekly consumption. Mixed models are robust to missingness under the assumptions of missing at random and missing completely at random, thereby maintaining analyses based on intention-to-treat principles. For outcomes with 2 time points, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Monitoring</title><p>The trial&#8217;s chief investigators performed the function of a Trial Steering Committee, because they had the technical expertise necessary to oversee all aspects of trial conduct (eg, monitor compliance with the protocol, provide ethical and clinical governance, provide standardized training and other means of quality control, and monitor trial arm fidelity). Given the minimal risks of harm associated with this brief intervention, a formal data-monitoring committee was not considered necessary. Regular liaison between the immediate research team and the principal investigator occurred to permit discussion of day-to-day trial progress and any potential concerns. The broader research team met intermittently to review the overall progress of the project and conduct the trial. Data audits were conducted at periodic intervals and were led by the trial manager.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Amendments</title><p>Protocol amendments were approved by the Eastern Health Human Research Ethics Committee. No major changes to the protocol were implemented without prior approval and there were no modifications to the intervention during the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse Events</title><p>The risk of harm or discomfort to participants during this trial was anticipated to be minor and transient, in line with the research team&#8217;s experience conducting brief alcohol intervention research (eg, minor distress responding to questions about alcohol consumption). The research team monitored possible adverse effects throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant Withdrawal and Discontinuation</title><p>All participants were advised that they had the right to withdraw consent at any time and without consequences. Withdrawal of consent could occur verbally or in written form (ie, email or text message correspondence), and participants could elect to remove all of their previously collected data or consent for further data collection. No further contact was initiated by the research team once the participants withdrew consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Ancillary and Posttrial Care</title><p>Participants were advised during enrollment and at the end of participating in their allocation intervention that they should continue to engage with health care as usual while participating in the study and to contact their primary care provider if their participation in this study raised concerns about any aspect of their health (ie, alcohol use, general health, breast cancer risk).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Program Implementation Evaluation</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Researchers conducting the process evaluation were based at Turning Point, with telephone or videoconferencing used to collect feedback from trial participants and breast screening staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The first component of the process evaluation comprised quantitative feedback about the health information received (Health4Her and control) and its implementation from the 497 women who participated in the 12-week follow-up assessment and responded to the program evaluation questions. Qualitative data about the Health4Her intervention and its implementation were collected from in-depth semistructured telephone interviews conducted with 30 participants after trial. A nested sample design was used to select a subsample of participants for the qualitative interviews [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. All women were asked if they would be interested in being contacted for an optional qualitative telephone interview. From those who consented to participate in this extra component of the study, systematic random sampling was used to contact participants who (1) were randomized to the active arm and (2) reported drinking alcohol at baseline to arrange an interview. Of this sample, 9 women were purposively sampled from participants who were drinking above the Australian Alcohol Guidelines at baseline assessment and who had consented to the optional interview.</p><p>Staff feedback about the intervention and implementation was obtained via 3 videoconferencing focus groups with 11 Maroondah BreastScreen staff members (managers=2, radiographers=6, and reception staff=3) held at the completion of the trial. All staff members who were interested in participating in a focus group and who were available on the day a focus group was being run were able to take part.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>Applicable elements of the RE-AIM framework [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] guided the development of the quantitative participant feedback schedule, the semistructured participant interview, and interpretation of participant feedback to understand the Health4Her intervention&#8217;s reach (eg, participants&#8217; use of health information and reach of information beyond trial participants [distributed health literacy]), efficacy (eg, intervention acceptability and perceived benefits), and implementation (eg, intervention delivered via iPad). Some elements of the CFIR [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were also used to understand the characteristics of the intervention (eg, format and delivery) and outer setting (eg, existing health campaigns and intervention needs) from the perspectives of participants to identify factors influencing successful implementation.</p><p>Applicable elements of the CFIR [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were used to guide the development of the semistructured staff focus group schedule and interpretation of staff feedback to understand the outer setting (eg, client needs and resources) and inner setting (eg, Maroondah BreastScreen culture, implementation climate, compatibility, and resources). Elements of the RE-AIM framework [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were also used to understand reach and efficacy relative to staff facilitating intervention delivery (eg, letting women know about the intervention in advance), adoption (eg, factors predicted to affect the uptake of the Health4Her intervention at other breast screening services), and maintenance (eg, factors that facilitate long-term uptake of the Health4Her intervention).</p><p>Guided by the RE-AIM framework [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the process evaluation also included the evaluation of trial and service administrative data collected during implementation (eg, intervention reach and uptake, such as the rate at which women participate in the trial of women invited to participate, reasons for nonparticipation when available, participant characteristics including health inequity factors [culturally and linguistically diverse background; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and other LGBTIQ+ status; experiencing disability; low education; and living alone], intervention reach beyond trial participants [distributed health literacy], and COVID-19 impact on operations).</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analyses</title><p>Summary data from quantitative trial and service data and participant feedback were expressed as counts and proportions or means and SDs. For participant and staff qualitative data, interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a professional transcribing company and organized using NVivo 20 according to the relevant domains of the RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks. Deductive thematic analysis was conducted using the framework method [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics Approval</title><p>This research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the 2007 National Health and Medical Research Council National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (updated 2018), the 2000 Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95), and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. This protocol and informed consent processes for each element of the research were approved by the Eastern Health Human Research Ethics Committee (LR19-011-50551) and the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (21,395).

Data collection for the formative evaluation was conducted from January to April 2020 (retrospective analysis of alcohol consumption data from Lifepool, n=49,240; web-based survey with breast screening service consumers, n=391; focus group and interviews with breast screening service consumers, n=31). Trial recruitment was conducted from February to August 2021 (n=588), with follow-up data collection finalized in December 2021. Quantitative process evaluation data were collected during trial implementation, and the collection of participant and staff feedback was finalized in December 2021 (participant quantitative feedback, n=588; participant qualitative feedback, n=30; and breast screening site staff feedback, n=11). We anticipate that the results of the retrospective analysis of alcohol consumption data from Lifepool (part of the mixed methods formative evaluation) will be published in March 2023. We anticipate that the results of this RCT will be published in March 2023. The program evaluation (comprising the preimplementation web-based survey and focus groups and interviews with subsets of breast screening service consumers and mixed methods process evaluation using trial and site administrative data and feedback from trial participants and breast screening site staff) is also planned for publication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Anticipated Findings</title><p>Previous research has found brief alcohol interventions to be effective in increasing alcohol-related knowledge and reducing alcohol consumption in primary care and other settings [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This is the first known hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to examine the benefits of a novel, tailored alcohol brief intervention among women attending the breast screening setting. The study design permits an extensive mixed methods program evaluation alongside a RCT to provide a sound understanding of the factors affecting implementation of the Health4Her intervention to predict and facilitate uptake in practice. The RCT is anticipated to provide evidence that Health4Her intervention increases the proportion of women accurately identifying alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor, improving alcohol literacy more broadly (ie, increasing the proportion of women accurately identifying the amount of alcohol in an Australian standard drink, the number of standard drinks in an average restaurant serve of red wine, and the maximum number of standard drinks per week recommended by current Australian Alcohol Guidelines), and reducing alcohol consumption. The breast screening appointment can act as a window of opportunity to increase engagement with breast cancer risk reduction information; this research will generate new substantial knowledge on the alcohol consumption and alcohol literacy needs of this population and the extent to which these can be addressed using a low-cost, scalable intervention, with the potential to contribute to the prevention of alcohol-attributable breast cancer and the related burden of disease and quality of life among this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial design, guided by applicable elements of the RE-AIM [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and CFIR frameworks [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], represents a key strength of this study. The integration of quantitative and qualitative data occurring at each level of the implementation evaluation [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] will build upon the outcomes of the RCT to provide real-world indicators of program implementation, to accelerate the translation of this research into practice. The RCT used a double-blind design; a typical limitation of brief alcohol intervention studies with hazardous drinkers in primary care settings is the bias introduced by difficulties with participant blinding [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. One limitation of this research is the risk of assessment reactivity, where mere exposure to alcohol questions prompts awareness and behavior self-regulation in the trial&#8217;s control group and can bias trial results toward the null and lead to underestimates of true intervention effects. In the design of the RCT, alcohol knowledge and consumption outcomes were interspersed with general lifestyle questions to minimize the salience of the trial&#8217;s alcohol focus. However, control group assessment reactivity may still occur. An additional limitation is that this initial trial was powered to identify a change in knowledge of alcohol as a breast cancer risk factor and not alcohol consumption per se. Still, this study will provide preliminary data on consumption end points, rates of missing data, and participant attrition, providing important estimates for future scaled-up research.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The benefits of brief alcohol interventions have been demonstrated in primary care and other settings; however, their effectiveness and implementation in the breast screening setting remain to be explored. The Health4Her intervention, targeting alcohol literacy and harmful consumption among women attending the breast screening setting, has huge potential for scalability and is particularly relevant considering the increasing prevalence of risky drinking among middle- to older-age women and strong evidence that even very light alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk. This study will evaluate both the effectiveness and implementation of Health4Her intervention to predict and facilitate uptake in breast screening services.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination Plan</title><p>The findings of this research will be disseminated to funding bodies and other relevant stakeholders, published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at national and international conferences, and presented via public talks and media and social media.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by research grants from VicHealth and Eastern Health Foundation.
