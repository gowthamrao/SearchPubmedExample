</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Tyrosine receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors offer one of the latest therapeutic advancements among a range of targeted treatments on the basis of genetic alterations in malignant cells. First-generation TRK inhibitors, such as larotrectinib and entrectinib, have been shown to be effective and well-tolerated treatments in patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ solid tumors (<italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+), with high response rates regardless of tumor histology.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Early results from three clinical trials demonstrated that larotrectinib is effective at shrinking tumors, with durable response across a range of different cancer types, including lung, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tumors.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Larotrectinib and entrectinib represent the first innovative precision therapies to receive approval from international authorization and commissioning bodies for the treatment of a specific genetic expression, regardless of the site from which the tumor originated.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The development of second-generation TRK inhibitors is currently underway. Such targeted therapies have clear advantages over conventional cytotoxic treatments and the systemic side effects they induce.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>These recent developments have important implications for patients, clinicians, and genomic screening services for health care providers worldwide. However, despite robust clinical response to TRK inhibitors, the natural history and prognostic implications of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> fusions in solid tumors are poorly understood, largely because of the rarity of such mutations. With the recent introduction of TRK inhibitor therapies and molecular testing for <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions into clinical practice, it is important to evaluate the prognostic significance of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions in survival to provide some context to the clinical effectiveness observed in clinical trials of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>-targeted therapies. In addition, although <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions are predictive of benefit from treatment with TRK inhibitors regardless of the tumor type, the prognostic significance of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions in clinical trials in the pan-tumor setting remains unclear.</p><p>Previous studies<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> have suggested that the prognosis for overall survival (OS) is worse in patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ solid tumors compared with those with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> fusion&#8211;negative (and/or wild-type fusions; <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>&#8211;) solid tumors. However, these studies are based on small numbers of patients, with a large amount of uncertainty around the reported estimates. The aim of this article was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies comparing OS in the <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ and <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>&#8211; cohorts to increase the statistical precision of the comparative survival rates. A reliable estimate of the prognostic value of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> status and survival will contribute to the evidence base and provide useful insights for ongoing and future trials of therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Search Strategy</title><p>This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Studies published up to August 11, 2022, were retrieved from Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed. The full literature search strategy is presented in Appendix Table A<xref rid="tblA1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. No restrictions on the basis of language, time, study design, or article type were made.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection Criteria</title><p>Articles were included in the review if they satisfied the following eligibility criteria: (1) the population included patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ solid tumors, (2) OS was included as an outcome, and (3) comparative results with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>&#8211; tumors were provided. The results from the respective electronical databases were combined, and duplicate references were removed. Abstracts were reviewed independently by two systematic reviewers against the eligibility criteria and classified as include, exclude, or unsure. Results were compared, and where discrepancies arose between reviewers, final consensus was reached by mutual consent. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer casted the deciding vote. For those abstracts selected for inclusion, the double review process was repeated using the full-text articles. The primary reason for exclusion at each stage was recorded. The bibliographies of all articles included for data extraction were hand searched for further eligible articles. Only unique patient cohorts were included in the meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Extraction</title><p>The following prespecified data items were extracted from the full-text articles of included studies and associated clinical study reports (if available), otherwise, the information was acquired from conference abstracts and posters if the full text was not available: study, patient cohort, sample size, study design, data source, country, patient age and sex, practice type (academic/community), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale, <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> fusion status, index date, censoring, follow-up time, number of events, OS rate, and covariate adjustment. The data were entered into a data extraction form and independently validated. The availability of Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and whether extraction of further data points using digitizing software and a previously published algorithm was necessary were determined.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Risk of Bias Assessment</title><p>Risk of bias was evaluated independently by two reviewers, using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This is a non-numerical, domain-based scale with acceptable validity and reliability and a comprehensive coverage of important biases. It comprises six domains related to methodological quality: participant selection, confounding control, exposure measurement, outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Each domain was graded as low, high, or unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Synthesis and Analysis</title><p>The study characteristics and availability of end point data were assessed to ascertain the feasibility of performing a quantitative evidence synthesis. First, log hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled for included studies using a fixed-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> (percentage of variability in group effect estimates because of between-study heterogeneity rather than sampling error). The fixed-effects approach assumes that all the effect estimates are evaluating a common underlying <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion effect, which may not be plausible in the presence of heterogeneity across studies. Ideally, given a larger number of studies, a random-effects approach would be used to incorporate any heterogeneity into the model. To address this limitation of very few studies, a Bayesian random-effects model was fitted, exploring the use of suitable prior distributions for the between-study heterogeneity parameter (including appropriate informative prior distributions).<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The random-effects models were compared using the leave-one-out information criteria (LOOIC); lower values indicate better fit. Results of the best-fitting model were presented in a forest plot, reporting the posterior mean log HR (95% credible interval [CrI]) for each study, along with the overall pooled effect (95% CrI). A funnel plot was inspected for evidence of reporting bias although a test for asymmetry was not used because of the small number of studies.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The statistical software RStudio version 4.2.1 (meta and brms packages) was used for the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="results"><title>Search Results</title><p>The search strategy was conducted on August 11, 2022, and retrieved 265 articles (Fig <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first such review conducted, providing an up-to-date synthesis of new and emerging evidence in this novel field of precision medicine using targeted TRK inhibitor therapies. Despite heterogeneity between studies, we were able to use random-effects Bayesian analysis and incorporate it into the model estimates. On the basis of the available evidence for a rare genomic alteration,<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which is now actionable, we provide a more precise and reliable estimate of the risk of mortality for patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ tumors in a natural setting across a range of tumor types.</p><p>Although there were few studies identified for inclusion in this review and most had a small sample size because of the rarity of the condition, the findings across studies were notably consistent. Despite there being variations across patient populations (age, patient sex, tumor type, progression) and methodology (choice of index date, matching criteria, censoring date), all studies reported the same direction of effect, that <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ status increases the risk of mortality, with varying degrees of uncertainty. Furthermore, all studies included in the meta-analysis excluded patients either receiving TRK inhibitors or censored at the date of initiation of such therapies. The pooled estimate from our study suggests that this genomic alteration is associated with a 50% increased risk of mortality within the first 10 years from diagnosis or the start of standard therapy, compared with patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>&#8211; tumors. The median OS was reported to be 10.2 and 12.7 months in the two studies where it was estimable. Longer OS has been reported in recent clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TRK inhibitors in patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ tumors, as would be anticipated in treated patients in a trial setting. For example, in an integrated analysis of three phase I/II clinical trials of entrectinib in 121 patients, the median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI, 23.4 to 46.4),<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and in a pooled analysis of three phase I/II clinical trials of larotrectinib in 159 patients, the median OS was 44.4 months (95% CI, 36.5 to not estimable).<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The main limitation of this review is the small number of studies included and the limited number of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ patients available in the study cohort, leading to an estimate where a high level of uncertainty remains. All the studies were retrospective case-control designs on the basis of databases collecting routine data and may not be completely representative of the wider patient population. The study populations were limited to patients who had been tested for this genetic mutation, which might have introduced selection bias. For example, testing may be more likely to be performed for certain tumor types, or in certain types of centers where testing is available, or in patients unresponsive to standard treatments. There were differences in the factors used for matching cases and controls across studies, and data were not available for all potential confounders, so bias because of confounding cannot be ruled out. However, balance was achieved by matching within study, ensuring that patient characteristics were balanced on key factors in the case and control groups. Limited information on baseline characteristics made it difficult to assess the heterogeneity of the patient populations across studies and how appropriate it was to combine them. There was limited scope to address the issue of potential heterogeneity and bias as only aggregate data summary estimates were available for three studies; however, if individual patient data became available, more sophisticated statistical methods could be used to mitigate this.</p><p>Criteria used for defining censoring times and patient inclusion criteria were not consistent across studies, and the studies used different index dates, capturing patients at mixed stages of the disease: Bridgewater et al<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> used the first date of cancer diagnosis for the gene sequenced tumor, Hibar et al<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> used the date of locally advanced/metastatic/recurrent disease diagnosis, and Santi et al<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> used the date of the first postbiopsy treatment. Combining these studies in a meta-analysis assumes that the hazard function for each group is constant over the periods between different index dates. This is difficult to establish although in a sensitivity analysis, the study by Hibar et al<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> obtained almost identical OS estimates when the date of the start of last available treatment line was used instead of the date of diagnosis. All three studies used Cox regression to estimate the HR; however, only the study by Bridgewater et al<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported that the proportional hazard assumption was satisfied. Although it is not possible to rule out the existence of nonproportionality, the published KM curves were notably consistent and displayed a clear separation in groups after 10-12 months, with the <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ group having poorer prognosis up to a follow-up of 3-4 years. The OS analyses also assumed that the prognostic effect of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion is the same across a broad range of tumor types, which may not be the case.</p><p>In conclusion, we have provided a more robust estimate of the prognostic effect of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ status in a real-world setting, given the caveats outlined above and the limited window of opportunity because of the likely proliferation of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>-targeted therapies in the future. It would be useful if further analyses could explore how differences in the choice of index date affect estimates of OS. The clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>+ solid tumors on standard treatments are not well characterized and are possibly highly variable across cancer types. Therefore, the study of larger cohorts to obtain tumor-specific estimates of OS would be a significant advance in knowledge. Further prognostic studies, which include additional prognostic factors to reduce residual confounding, are required to confirm the prognostic value of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions and to increase precision.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="contributed"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><bold>Conception and design:</bold> Jesus Garcia-Foncillas, Antoine Italiano, Gilles Vassal, Noman Paracha, Marisca Marian, Keith Abrams</p><p><bold>Administrative support:</bold> Louise Linsell, Keith Abrams</p><p><bold>Provision of study materials or patients:</bold> Ulrik Lassen, Carsten Bokemeyer, Jesus Garcia-Foncillas</p><p><bold>Collection and assembly of data:</bold> Antoine Italiano, Noman Paracha, Marisca Marian, Yuxian Chen, Louise Linsell</p><p><bold>Data analysis and interpretation:</bold> Ulrik Lassen, Carsten Bokemeyer, Jesus Garcia-Foncillas, Antoine Italiano, Noman Paracha, Marisca Marian, Yuxian Chen, Louise Linsell, Keith Abrams</p><p><bold>Manuscript writing:</bold> All authors</p><p><bold>Final approval of manuscript:</bold> All authors</p><p><bold>Accountable for all aspects of the work:</bold> All authors</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this manuscript.
