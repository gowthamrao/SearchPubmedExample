</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent a class of immunotherapy treatments that have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic cancers, such as melanoma.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Despite the success of this treatment in a subgroup of the patient population, a significant proportion of patients does not respond or experiences severe side effects. Hence, a strong need remains to improve patient stratification and to better understand different patterns of response,<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> such as dissociate response and pseudoprogression. Several studies investigated the efficacy and safety outcomes of ICIs in both RCTs and real-world settings. They not only partially reported similar results for both approaches<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but also observed differences, mainly indicating lower survival and more severe adverse events in real-world populations.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Acknowledging the role of RWE generated from such population-based observational studies for assessing the generalizability of RCT findings, both US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency promote RWE to support regulatory decision making.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Despite its promise and the ubiquity of clinical RWD, RWE is difficult to obtain. RWD, such as clinical or imaging data, typically must undergo labor-intensive curation steps before they can be used in quantitative population analyses and contribute to RWE. For example, RWD investigations of the response patterns after treatment with ICIs require structured access to (1) patient and treatment information for cohort selection, (2) clinical covariates such as information about blood, molecular, or genetic markers, and (3) longitudinal information about tumor burden and characteristics, ideally at the single-lesion resolution. Most of this information is not readily available from the raw data collected in clinical routine that consist of mainly unstructured entries in electronic health records (EHRs) and archived imaging data, both oriented toward clinical use. To enable the use of EHR data for RWD studies, information about patient characteristics, diagnoses, and treatment history must be extracted and structured. Similarly, imaging data need to be annotated to identify and extract relevant information. In the context of oncologic imaging for assessing the response to anticancer treatments, quantitative information about the longitudinal evolution of tumor characteristics and burden is needed. This type of information is typically collected in RCTs using criteria such as RECIST<sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> or positron emission tomography (PET) Response Criteria in Solid Tumors.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Both rely on longitudinal measurements of tumor size or quantification of tumor metabolism from imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), PET, or a combination of both (PET/CT). Although lesion-level quantitative PET/CT assessment is also performed in clinical practice, criteria such as RECIST are not directly used to assess patient response or disease progression and the patient's overall tumor burden remains unquantified. Instead, radiologic evidence is mostly described qualitatively in natural language, thus providing insufficient details for subsequent quantitative assessment of tumor response.<sup><xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, the validity of RWE strongly relies on data quality.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> As manual curation is very time-consuming, large-scale population analyses require automated RWD processing approaches. For such strategies to produce actionable RWE, automation-induced inaccuracies must be minimized, and any resulting errors need to be well-characterized and considered when interpreting results. If performed carefully, automated curation of textual clinical data from EHRs can yield results comparable with manually curated data, as recently demonstrated for textual data from EHR in the context of population pharmacokinetics.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>This study provides further evidence for the feasibility of automated RWD curation in the context of response assessment to ICIs. Beginning by outlining the conceptual steps involved in RWD extraction and curation for RWE creation, we propose strategies for quality control and iterative refinement of automatically curated text- and image-based RWD. In particular, our work focuses on strategies for assessing the suitability of automated longitudinal tumor burden measurements for population-based analyses of tumor response to ICIs. We demonstrate how longitudinal information can be exploited to increase the accuracy of automated tumor burden assessments. We further show that the resulting information can serve as a substitute for manually curated disease progression assessments at the population level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the key steps involved in semiautomated collection and curation of clinical and imaging RWD for retrospective biomedical studies. These include (1) extraction of RWD from hospital sources, (2) enrichment of the raw data with information that enable identification and retrieval of key data elements, (3) data selection on the basis of this information, and (4) quality assurance to assess data consistency. In practice, steps (2)-(4) form an iterative data consolidation process that terminates when the targeted consistency criteria have been met. Despite differences in the specific methods and strategies, the same conceptual sequence of steps applies to different types of RWD, such as text-based information from EHRs or clinical imaging data. Although quality assurance steps are typically supported by methodological and technical developments tailored to specific RWD use cases (local clinical practice, information system, data formats, etc), we focus here on generalizable aspects in the context of text- and image-based RWD curation for oncologic research.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>FIG 1.</label><caption><p>Key steps involved in collection and curation of real-world clinical and imaging data.

The structured data (eg, treatment line or radiologic response) are then quality-controlled by clinicians and complemented with structured EHR data such as laboratory values and radiotherapy administration data.</p><sec><title>
Cohort and imaging examination selection.
</title><p>The present RWD exploration focuses on the first ICI line in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma treated at CHUV between April 2014 and February 2021. Usage of patient data was approved by the local Ethics Committee (CER-VD protocol No. 2019-00448) for patients who did not refuse consent. For patients to be included in this cohort, at least two PET/CT images between three months before ICI initiation and one year after ICI discontinuation or the next treatment line were required. In the following, we refer to images acquired before and after first-line ICI start as baseline and follow-up images, respectively. To prevent confounders from obscuring real ICI effect evaluation, localized treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy were considered when selecting the appropriate imaging examinations. We excluded baseline images collected before and follow-up images collected after cancer-related surgeries. Similarly, images collected after the first radiotherapy session (excluding treatment for brain metastases since not evaluable using PET/CT) were omitted. For the selected cohort, demographic (eg, age, sex) and clinical characteristics (eg, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status), laboratory values, and somatic mutations (ie, <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>) were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>
Quality assurance.
</title><p>We verified and corrected the clinical data set using multiple quality control mechanisms and by involving clinicians to help validate the extracted data. In particular, we used process mining, an important novel methodology for visualization and deep analysis of event-based data sets, as implemented in the pMineR R library.<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> For this, an event log was generated, listing the sequence of events for each patient. Then, a first-order Markov process model was inferred, which allows quick inconsistency detection by spotting aberrant paths in the process graphs.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Curation of Imaging Data</title><sec><title>
Automated series identification and image segmentation.
</title><p>To select the PET and CT images best suited for further processing, we established rules that automatically identified the relevant acquisition protocols among all images retrieved from the institutional Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Segmentation of the selected PET/CT images relied on the artificial intelligence&#8211;based <italic toggle="yes">PET-Assisted Reporting System</italic> (PARS) prototype software (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc, Knoxville, TN).<sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> PARS segments and identifies tumor lesions from PET/CT in a two-step process: first, three-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) with elevated Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) are selected. These are then classified into (1) <italic toggle="yes">benign</italic> ROIs where elevated SUV is physiologically expected (eg, metabolically active regions such as the brain) and (2) <italic toggle="yes">malignant</italic> ROIs where high SUV indicates the presence of metabolically active cancer cells. In addition, each ROI is assigned to an anatomic location, selected from a set of predefined body parts and organs. The assignment of malignancy status and anatomic location relies on convolutional neural networks trained on lymphoma and lung cancer cases. For these indications, PARS is reported to achieve an AUC of the receiver-operating characteristic of &gt;0.95 for lesion classification and anatomic localization, and accuracies of 96% for body part and 87% for organ localization.<sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>
Longitudinal lesion mapping.
</title><p>Additional processing is needed to identify lesion correspondences across imaging time points (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). We developed an automated approach for this longitudinal mapping task on the basis of the assumption that ROIs repeatedly observed at the same location likely correspond to the <italic toggle="yes">same</italic> tumor lesion. The mapping started with a sequence of image registration steps (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). First, images were cropped to the patient's trunk, and the CT images corresponding to two subsequent acquisition time points were spatially aligned by affine registration. Then, the subvolumes surrounding each ROI at time points k and k + 1 were extracted, and deformable registration was performed between all pairs (ROI<sub>i,k</sub>, ROI<sub>j,k+1</sub>). For each coregistered pair, we computed the spatial overlap between ROIs. From the resulting information, a graph data structure was built (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C), which enabled identification of corresponding ROIs across imaging examinations and thus longitudinal follow-up of individual tumor lesions (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>FIG 2.</label><caption><p>Longitudinal follow-up of individual tumor lesions: (A) longitudinal mapping aims at establishing correspondences between the ROIs observed and segmented across a patient's imaging examinations.

Lesion-level and patient-level performance evaluation.

To evaluate automatic segmentation and classification performance, as well as the impact of longitudinal mapping and voting on overall data quality, we established two benchmarks.</p><sec><title>Lesion-level evaluation against expert-annotated ground truth.</title><p>Two independent reviews were performed by two experienced nuclear medicine experts. First, one expert reviewed PARS segmentation results of baseline and first follow-up images for a group of 10 patients, balanced in terms of patient clinical progression status (extracted from clinical records). This data set served to provide an initial estimate of segmentation quality and to adjust segmentation parameters. A second review by the other expert aimed at creating a representative ground-truth data set to allow systematic evaluation of segmentation performance and of the effect of various postprocessing approaches. For this purpose, the automatically segmented tumor lesions (n = 214) in about 5% of all imaging examinations (n = 24) were reviewed to identify ROIs erroneously classified as malignant. The examinations were randomly selected but chosen to reflect the repartition of disease burden in the overall population (quantified by the number of malignant lesions, n<sub>mal</sub>): 50% with n<sub>mal</sub> &#8804; 5, 25% with 5 &lt; n<sub>mal</sub> &#8804; 15, and 25% with n<sub>mal</sub> &gt; 15. We also investigated all imaging examinations (n = 26) in which PARS had failed to detect the presence of malignant lesions despite the radiology report suggesting otherwise. On the basis of these expert reviews, we evaluated (1) classification <italic toggle="yes">precision</italic> at the lesion level and (2) the <italic toggle="yes">negative predictive value</italic> (NPV) at the examination level.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient-level evaluation against clinical outcome.</title><p>To validate our lesion selection approach at the patient level, we evaluated the agreement between the temporal evolution of image-derived total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and clinical response.

We compared the clinical response with results obtained from automated image analysis in terms of TMTV change, progression events derived from TMTV change, and resulting progression-free survival (PFS).

This relatively low proportion can be attributed to the availability of other image modalities (ie, CT or magnetic resonance images) for cancer diagnosis and to imaging performed outside of CHUV.

No standard approaches for automatic RWD extraction and curation exist, and hence, RWD curation is performed in a costly manual process to increase data quality for RWD studies. Here, we argue for the need for improved systems that can leverage RWD and we present evidence for the feasibility of automated RWD curation in the context of tumor response evaluation to ICIs. We identified recurring steps in the collection and curation process of text- and image-based RWD and proposed a general framework and specific strategies for addressing them. We showed that process mining can be integrated in iterative data consolidation workflows to improve data quality by providing easily interpretable synthetic representations of patient care pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that suitable postprocessing enables off-the-shelf PET/CT segmentation tools to quantify tumor burden from real-world imaging data, in such a way that resulting population-level outcome measures such as PFS match those derived from time-consuming expert annotations.</p><p>This study highlights the role of data selection and the importance of quality control metrics in automated RWD curation: although RWD are intrinsically limited to the information routinely documented as part of clinical care, automated collection and curation strategies may increase the risk of missing or misinterpreting existing information in a subset of patients for whom the extraction or semantic annotation algorithms are not optimally adapted. Those situations confront researchers with a trade-off between data quality and final data set size. In the presented case, we used an existing tool (PARS) for automatic tumor segmentation from PET/CT imaging. Similar to other products, PARS is designed to assist clinicians in identifying and contouring tumor lesions and prioritizes high detection sensitivity to avoid potentially malignant lesions being overlooked. In the context of quantitative response assessment, however, the software's high detection sensitivity, resulting in a high number of incorrectly detected tumors, introduced substantial noise in the data curation process. We mitigated the impact of segmentation uncertainty by applying data selection and consistency-improving schemes, thus increasing data quality while reducing the size of our data set. The proposed postprocessing strategy on the basis of longitudinal tracking of individual lesions enabled us to (1) identify the ROIs that persist over time and (2) select those that were consistently classified as malignant. Together, these criteria allowed the high number of false positives to be reduced significantly while preserving the overall treatment response pattern. We monitored the impact of curation steps on data quality and quantity to guide the iterative RWD consolidation process using three different types of assessments: (1) cohort-level self-consistency with process mining; (2) lesion-level performance evaluation against a small, but representative expert-annotated ground-truth data set; and (3) patient-level comparison of image-derived measurement with clinical progression assessments. Our evaluation indicates that the data resulting from automated RWD curation can support population-based analyses, such as PFS estimation and longitudinal response modeling.</p><p>While our study was based on 446 imaging examinations, lesion-level assessment (2) could only be performed on a subset of about 5% of these examinations. Although limited in size, this subset was chosen to be representative in terms of the number of identified lesions for patients with low, medium, and high tumor burden, respectively. Moreover, the fact that the proposed data preparation strategy successfully reproduced clinical progression events in assessment (3) gives us strong confidence in the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, our pipeline should be validated in large-scale future studies including a larger number of expert-reviewed examinations of multiple cancer types, originating from multiple centers and acquired on multiple imaging platforms.</p><p>We expect the combination of longitudinal lesion tracking and consistency voting to have high potential for automated RWD curation for population-based analyses of cancer treatment outcomes, but the accuracy achievable with current automatic segmentation tools may not suffice for usage in clinical applications. Nevertheless, we believe that automatic longitudinal tracking, in conjunction with improved segmentation tools, will also have applications beyond the population research context, for example, to assist radiologists in follow-up examination assessments or as a monitoring tool that helps oncologists review patient cases on the basis of trends in disease evolution.</p><p>Although further development is needed, we believe that semi- or fully automated approaches such as the ones presented will ultimately help make RWD more accessible. By combining clinical and imaging data, these approaches pave the way for improved patient selection and treatment recommendations in the era of personalized medicine. A recent paper highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence techniques combined with pharmacometrics to guide treatment individualization in the specific context of ICIs.<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Indeed, our curated tumor evolution data can be analyzed using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation approaches to capture patterns of tumor responses to treatment.<sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is growing interest in medical imaging data to guide therapies via noninvasive image-based biomarkers. Following the segmentation and longitudinal mapping steps, quantitative image descriptors, so-called radiomics features, can be computed straightforwardly for all identified tumors. Such features were shown to be predictive markers of overall survival in several cancer types<sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and have the potential to predict early response to ICIs in patients with melanoma.<sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Automatic extraction and curation of imaging RWD may thus provide important opportunities, not only for the confirmation of RCT results in a real-world setting but also for biomarker discovery. The proposed framework can help collect and analyze data in a harmonized way across different hospitals to assemble larger cohorts for RWD multicentric studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank the Clinical Research Data Warehouse team of the CHUV for providing access to the clinical data, Marian Caikovski (CHUV) for developing our data curation tools, and Fr&#233;d&#233;ric P&#233;dron (CHUV) for assisting with PET/CT image extraction.
