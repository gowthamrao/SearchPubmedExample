Co-occurring physical and mental illness further increases the risk of self-harm and suicide. However, the association between this co-occurrence and frequent self-harm episodes is not well understood. The objectives of the study were (a) to examine the sociodemographic and clinical profile of individuals with frequent self-harm (regardless of suicidal intent) episodes and, (b) the association between physical and mental illness comorbidity, self-harm repetition, highly lethal self-harm methods, and suicide intent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study included consecutive patients with five or more self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments across three general hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. The study included file reviews (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 183) and semi-structured interviews (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 36). Multivariate logistic regression models and independent samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests were used to test the association between the sociodemographic and physical and mental disorders comorbidity on highly lethal self-harm methods and suicidal intent, respectively. Thematic analysis was applied to identify themes related to physical and mental illness comorbidity and frequent self-harm repetition.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The majority of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes were female (59.6%), single (56.1%), and unemployed (57.4%). The predominant current self-harm method was drug overdose (60%). Almost 90% of the participants had history of a mental or behavioral disorder, and 56.8% had recent physical illness. The most common psychiatric diagnoses were alcohol use disorders (51.1%), borderline personality disorder (44.0%), and major depressive disorder (37.8%). Male gender (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 2.89) and alcohol abuse (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 2.64) predicted the risk of a highly lethal self-harm method. Suicide intent was significantly higher among those with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 2.43; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.020). Major qualitative themes were (a) the functional meaning of self-harm (b) self-harm comorbidity (c) family psychiatric history and (d) contacts with mental health services. Participants described experiencing an uncontrollable self-harm urge, and self-harm was referred to as a way to get relief from emotional pain or self-punishment to cope with anger and stressors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Physical and mental illness comorbidity was high among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes. Male gender and alcohol abuse were associated with highly lethal self-harm methods.

Although there are inconsistencies and varying definitions, suicidal behavior as a general term encompassing any suicidal thought or actions without taking additional steps to distinguish thoughts from plans, from non-fatal attempts, and from attempts that result in death (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The term self-harm, used throughout this manuscript, refers to self-harm behavior regardless of suicidal intent. According to the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, self-harm was the main contributor to Years of Life Lost (YLL) from mental disorders in 31 European countries (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Self-harm is associated with multiple mental health conditions, including mood disorders (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), borderline personality disorder (BPD) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), alcohol abuse, schizophrenia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), adjustment disorder (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), eating disorders (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and attention deficit hyper activity disorder (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Emotional dysregulation, specifically a non-acceptance of emotional responses, lack of emotional awareness, difficulties in impulse control and engaging in goal-directed behavior, are all associated with self-harm (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The act of self-harm has been described to be conducted with the intent to alleviate negative affect, and the negative affect and arousal are reduced by the performance of self-harm (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, studies that have examined self-harm severity/lethality in connection with mental disorders report that alcohol abuse (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), BPD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and depression further increase the risk of more repeated highly lethal self-harm episodes (HLSMs) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>While the association between mental health conditions and self-harm is well established (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the role of physical illness in self-harm or suicidal thoughts is less known. Previous research indicates that several chronic physical illnesses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) including epilepsy, asthma, migraine, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, eczema, and inflammatory polyarthritis are associated with an increased risk of self-harm (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Suicide risk increases with the number of co-occurring physical illnesses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). While a physical illness alone is not associated with self-harm or suicidal thoughts (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the combination of physical and mental health conditions significantly increases the risk of both (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), with an elevated risk related to the onset of both physical and disorders occurring close in time to one another (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Mental disorders, especially depression, often coexists among people with chronic physical illness (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and this is associated with heightened risk of self-harm. There is a wealth of studies in this area (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) albeit, specific to older people. The findings of a systematic review revealed that functional disability and numerous specific conditions (including malignant diseases, neurological disorders, pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, male genital disorders, and arthritis/arthrosis) were associated with self-harm among older persons (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Although mental and physical disorders are commonly reported among individuals who self-harm (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), comorbidities specific to individuals with frequent self-harm episodes have rarely been studied. Yet, they are a high risk group due to the strong association between previous self-harm, future self-harm (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and suicide (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The risk of self-harm repetition increases with each additional hospital self-harm presentation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), with the highest risk among those with a history of five or more presentations (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Often referred to as major repeaters (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), these individuals represent a proportion of high suicide risk (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Individuals with frequent self-harm episodes comprise more than 10% of all self-harm presentations (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), frequently engage with health services (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and have difficulties in controlling self-harm behavior, although the broader characteristics of this sub-group are under-researched (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). To our knowledge, only a few studies are available among this group (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and these studies included small samples of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes. These studies show that individuals with frequent self-harm episodes predominantly represent females and have a diagnosis of psychiatric illness (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Evidence is still lacking to conclusively provide a profile of these patients and associated comorbidities. Within this context, the main objectives of the present study were (a) to examine the sociodemographic and clinical profile of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes, (b) the association between physical and mental illness comorbidity and highly lethal self-harm methods (HLSMs), (c) the association between sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status, living and employment status) and HLSMs, (d) the association between suicide intent and psychiatric illnesses, and (e) to investigate the comorbidity factors contributing to self-harm repetition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study uses a mixed-methods convergent parallel design in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed simultaneously (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

In each hospital, potential cases for review were first identified by hospital staff, i.e., Clinical Nurse Specialists or Crisis Nurses or Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors in the ED before the researchers were provided with access to the patients&#8217; case files. The hospital staff were involved in screening self-harm cases according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The researchers conducted regular reviews of all self-harm cases to ensure that inclusion and exclusion criteria were being applied correctly and no cases were missed.</p><p>Data extraction was performed by the research team and included: medical history; psychiatric history; diagnosis; self-harm history; personal and family history; and sociodemographic information.

This included both acts with and without the intention to die. Frequent self-harm was defined as five or more previous self-harm presentations to hospital emergency departments, including the index presentation. Comorbidity was defined in the literature as &#8220;any distinct additional entity that has existed or may occur during the clinical course of a patient who has the index disease under study&#8221; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We operationally defined comorbidity as a co-occurring physical illness or mental disorder, or substance use disorder which existed with a self-harm episode among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes. We defined individuals with frequent self-harm episodes as those with a history of five or more self-harm presentations to the hospitals. We defined HLSMs in accordance with the criteria of Persett et al.

The interviews and file reviews were conducted by trained members of the research team comprising of postdoctoral researchers, a PhD scholar, and a research officer, under the supervision of the principal investigator. Following interest from the patients, researchers subsequently provided a brief introduction of the research with an invitation letter and study information leaflet <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> post or in person whilst at the hospital premises. When patients agreed and consented to participation, the patient&#8217;s preferred time and venue were considered when scheduling the interview.</p><p>A semi-structured interview schedule, containing both closed and open-ended questions, was used for the interviews. The interview schedule covered standard sociodemographic data, medical and psychiatric history and psychosocial variables representing risk and protective factors for self-harm. The interview schedule used for this study was flexible, enabling the exploration of further details as required.</p><p>Suicide intent during the index self-harm presentation was assessed using the Beck Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The SIS is a fifteen-item interviewer-administered questionnaire, designed to assess the severity of suicidal intent associated with self-harm episodes. Each item scores 0&#8211;2, giving a total score range of 0&#8211;30, whereby a high score indicates high levels of suicide intent. The questionnaire is divided into two sections: the first eight items comprise the &#8220;circumstances&#8221; section, concerned with the objective circumstances of the self-harm act. The remaining seven items form the &#8220;self-report&#8221; section and are based on the patient&#8217;s own reconstruction of their feelings and thoughts at the time of the self-harm act. The SIS fifteen-item Cronbach&#8217;s alpha score in the current sample was 0.84.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study complies with the Irish Data Protection Act of 1988 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), the Irish Data Protection Amendment Act of 2003 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

Descriptive analyses were performed on data obtained from the file review and semi-structured interviews. Fisher&#8217;s exact test (FET) was used to compare the sociodemographic variables in both data sources. For all statistical tests, categorical variables were condensed into a binary response.</p><p>The association of sociodemographic variables, physical and mental disorders comorbidity and HLSMs was examined using FET and Odds Ratios with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values and 95% confidence intervals provided. A multivariable logistic regression model was estimated introducing sociodemographic and physical and mental disorders comorbidity variables statistically significant in the FET. This variable selection procedure has the capability of retaining important confounding variables, resulting potentially in a richer model (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The significant predictors from the first model (i.e., gender and alcohol use disorders) were further examined in an additional regression model for understanding the consistency of these predictors over two self-harm episodes. For the second model, &#8220;recent HLSMs&#8221; was treated as the dependent variable. All categorical variables were dummy coded (see <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Appendix 1</xref>). Further, we tested multicollinearity using linear regression and there was no evidence of this in the model (<italic toggle="yes">variance inflation factor</italic> &#8804; 1.03).</p><p>An Independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used to test the association between physical and mental disorders comorbidity and suicide intent.

The findings are consistent with two other studies in this area, indicating that individuals with frequent self-harm episodes are predominantly female, have a psychiatric diagnosis, (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) are unemployed (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), have a diagnosis of BPD and/or substance abuse, and have a high personal and familial risk history (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We provide further information on this subgroup: the predominant self-harm method was IDO, they reported a history of recent physical illness and physical pain, a history of many traumatic life events including violent sexual assault, severe bullying, and torture, with an extensive family history of mental illness, self-harm and substance abuse, and they expressed mild to moderate suicide intent. Physical (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and psychiatric co-existing disorders are known to be associated with self-harm (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the proportion of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes suffering from BPD, MDD, substance abuse, physical illness, physical pain, sexual assault was substantially high in our study. For instance, we have found high prevalence of chronic pain (72.2%) and/or major depressive disorders (37.8%) among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes as compared to the prevalence of 35.5% (chronic pain) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or depressive disorders (22.8%) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) reported in primary care population (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or in general community population (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Moreover, many of these conditions coexisted each other and constituted to an extensive comorbidity profile (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Key profile of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fpsyt-14-1121313-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>The IDO as a predominant self-harm method among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes could be explained in the context of psychiatric illness and treatment. For instance, most of the individuals with frequent self-harm episodes or their family members were on treatment for a psychiatric illness, or physical pain, thus increasing the risk by stock piling prescribed medication. It is likely that accessibility and availability of the drugs, combined with strong self-harm urges increase the risk of IDOs. This is in line with previous research indicating that the prescription of psychotropic drugs is associated with the use of these drugs in IDOs, particularly minor tranquillizers (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Although most individuals with frequent self-harm episodes had engaged in IDO, we examined the characteristics of the subgroup representing those with HLSMs. Male gender and alcohol use disorders consistently predicted HLSMs, while other sociodemographic or physical and mental disorders variables were not significant. The association between gender and self-harm methods has been documented previously, with male gender increasing the risk of having a violent (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) or severe self-harm episodes (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Violent methods were further associated with risk of suicide (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Studies also reported an association between substance abuse and violent (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) or lethal self-harm (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Inconsistent with other studies, (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), a coexisting psychosis was not associated with HLSMs in the current study. However, notably, the prevalence of psychosis was relatively lower in the study samples. A diagnosis of MDD was not associated with HLSMs, while this was associated with suicide intent. The association between MDD and suicide intent is well established (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Although a higher proportion of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes had physical illness, this was not associated with HLSMs. The association between a physical illness and HLSMs is under researched. Nevertheless, some available research has demonstrated the association of physical illness with self-harm repetition (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), although this was also inconsistent (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Physical pain was reported by most of the study participants, but this was not associated with suicide intent. A few other studies had reported the association between pain intensity and suicide ideation (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and pain-related condition and suicide (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). However, the association between physical illness or physical pain and self-harm is under-researched (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and requires more research to provide reliable conclusions.</p><p>The qualitative findings reveal critical themes including functional meaning of self-harm, self-harm comorbidity, family psychiatric history, and contacts with mental health services. Most of the participants who engaged in repeated self-harm had low intention to die and the self-harm often resulted from an uncontrollable self-harm urge, as reported in previous research (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Previous researchers have even developed instruments to measure the cognitive and emotional aspects of this craving (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) and repeated self-harm behaviors have been conceptualized as an addiction (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Only one study examined self-harm craving among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes, and reported characteristics similar to addictive behaviors including tolerance, loss of control, and continuation of self-harm behaviors despite significant negative consequences (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The findings of the current study support the notion that individuals with frequent self-harm episodes engage in addictive behaviors relating to self-harm, mostly coexisting with BPD. An uncontrollable self-harm urge or some addictive behaviors are mostly suited to explain the repeated self-harm behavior in BPD but is insufficient to explain the repeated episodes of other individuals with frequent self-harm episodes who presented without this diagnosis. It is unlikely that a single conceptualization like self-harm urges, or addiction would be adequate to explain these complex behaviors. Thus, it is postulated that this subgroup has an extensive profile of self-harm comorbidity evidenced by the qualitative and quantitative findings. Among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes with a physical illness, almost all had a diagnosis of a mental/behavioral disorder, a finding supported by previous research demonstrating that a number of chronic diseases are associated with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Congruent to the current findings, high personal and family risk history including sexual abuse was also reported among individuals with frequent self-harm episodes (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). We also identified mental health system related barriers for accessing help, which indeed has potential impact on self-harm and wellbeing. Many system related issues including lack of mental health professionals and delays in availing of appointments with public mental health services had been identified previously, with a recommendation for effective system planning (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>).</p><p>This study has many strengths, including the focus on individuals with frequent self-harm episodes who have the highest risk of prospective repeated self-harm. Hence, examining their unique profile and associated comorbidities is important for effective assessment and management of self-harm. Among this subgroup, this is the first mixed-method study involving a large sample size. Participants in the semi-structured interview group can be considered a strong representation of individuals with frequent self-harm episodes while there were no significant differences between the two groups on key sociodemographic characteristics. The file review and interview data complemented each other to address the study objectives. For example, physical pain, suicide intent, traumatic life events and family history of mental disorders were not documented well in the file review, while the semi structured interview data had provided more comprehensive information. Similarly, the file review data addressed the potential predictors of HLSMs, while the qualitative data reflected participants&#8217; own experiences of having physical and mental health comorbidities related to self-harm. A further strength of this study is that the potential predictors identified were consistent over multiple self-harm episodes within one individual. Therefore, these variables may be considered to be more strongly associated with HLSMs. Highly lethal methods of a recent self-harm episode are known to be related to a high risk of subsequent suicide (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), which underlines the significance of these findings for suicide prevention.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study findings must be interpreted with the following considerations. First, we concurrently used file review data and semi-structured interview data to examine the study objectives. Although this approach has potential to complement each other, the file review data is retrospective in nature, hence, the limitations applicable to retrospective findings are applicable to the current findings. Second, many variables in the file review had unrecorded values, which were not included for the analysis, while this would have impacted on our prevalence estimates. This under recording points out the need for improving biopsychosocial assessment and documentation for this self-harm subgroup. Third, the diagnosis of a physical or mental disorder was based on the casefiles of the patients, made by a registered physician or psychiatrist. While the diagnosis was relied on the individual clinician&#8217;s judgment, we did not use any standard instruments to verify the diagnosis with the subgroup participated in the interview study. Fourth, certain groups of patients could not be considered for the study (e.g., patients with acute psychotic or mood symptoms or those who were unconscious or in induced coma because of the severity of the self-harm act). While their condition implied inability to take part in the interview study and or provide informed consent, valuable lived experience was missed from this group. Fifth, the operationalization of highly lethal or violent self-harm methods varied, and this could include (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or exclude (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) self-cutting. We considered self-cutting as HLSM as there are large scale longitudinal studies which demonstrate that self-cutting increases the risk of suicide, compared to those with self-poisoning (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Although a HLSM can increase the risk for suicide, the method alone can&#8217;t be completely attributed to suicide or even lethality or severity. A serious suicide attempt is a combination of medical lethality, potential lethality of the method used, and severity of the objective circumstances of the suicide intent (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Biopsychosocial assessment should be carried out to all individuals with frequent self-harm episodes as a part of routine clinical services in EDs. Due to incompleteness of biopsychosocial assessments in 30% of participants, it is recommended to improve training and supervision to ensure completeness of core elements of the biopsychosocial assessment, which is line with recommendations of the National Clinical Programme for Self-harm and Suicide related Ideation in Ireland (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), Royal College of Psychiatrists (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) and NICE guideline (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Screening of possible comorbidities should be introduced on the clinical practices, specifically, screening for substance use disorder, borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorders. Physical illnesses especially chronic physical pain also should be assessed and managed. While the association between physical and mental health comorbidities and self-harm repetition is evident, future studies should examine the specific association between these comorbidities and completed suicide.</p><p>In addition, future studies should also identify the effective components of psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., biopsychosocial risk assessment/safety planning/cognitive behavior therapy) for individuals with frequent self-harm episodes and or training and capacity building programmes for key healthcare professionals for addressing the increased self-harm and suicide risk among this self-harm subgroup.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is one of few studies examining mental and physical health comorbidities among a high-risk self-harm group.
