In today&#8217;s society, with intensifying workplace competition and the accelerating pace of life, individuals across various professions are facing increasing pressure, leading to a growing prevalence of job burnout. Nurses are reported to experience higher rates of job burnout compared to other healthcare workers, with global statistics indicating an overall job burnout rate of 11.2% among nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Their critical role in providing care to vulnerable patients exposes them to significant physical and psychological stress, contributing to job burnout as they manage comprehensive patient care demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This burnout is often exacerbated by factors such as heavy workloads, irregular hours, &#8220;voluntary&#8221; overtime, rotating shifts, and understaffing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A survey on the mental health of nurses across five countries found that 15&#8211;40% of nurses experience job burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated burnout among nurses, with recent research documenting job burnout rates as high as 68.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, identifying and preventing the progression of job burnout in the early stages of a nursing career may be crucial for reducing burnout prevalence among nurses and enhancing the quality of healthcare services.</p><p id="Par7">Job burnout is a gradual process of energy depletion that occurs during work, affecting an individual&#8217;s attitudes, perceptions, and judgments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Job burnout not only affects personal physical and mental health but also has adverse effects on job efficiency and career development. However, its origins are not solely rooted in work-related stress but often have deeper psychological causes. Recently, there has been growing interest among researchers in exploring the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and job burnout. ACEs refer to negative experiences during childhood that can profoundly affect psychological growth, such as parental death, domestic violence, parental divorce, and emotional neglect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These experiences may lead to psychological trauma, which in turn influences an individual&#8217;s mental state and coping mechanisms in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that individuals with ACEs are more likely to develop negative personality traits such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, making them more susceptible to job burnout when exposed to work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Notably, nursing interns represent a unique group in the early stages of their careers. Unlike nursing students, who primarily engage in part-time clinical interactions, interns take on full-time, independent patient care responsibilities. They handle tasks ranging from intravenous treatments to emergency responses while navigating the complexities of interdisciplinary communication, often without the comprehensive support systems available to professional nurses. While standard pre-job education and systematic intern programs facilitate nursing students in acknowledging their intern identity, their professional identities are somewhat vague in terms of time. This transitional role, straddling student and professional identities, intensifies stress levels. In addition, unlike seasoned nurses, interns lack the resilience and coping strategies honed through experience, making them particularly susceptible to early burnout, which affects their career trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, studying the adverse effects of childhood adversity among nursing interns would be beneficial for identifying at-risk individuals early and providing appropriate interventions to prevent job burnout.</p><p id="Par9">In addition, previous studies have found that sleep duration is inversely associated with nurses&#8217; job burnout in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sleep problems not only contribute to increased physical fatigue but also negatively affect emotional regulation and cognitive abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For instance, previous research has demonstrated a significant association between chronic sleep deprivation and reduced work efficiency, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], all of which can ultimately exacerbate the occurrence of job burnout. This is particularly true for individuals who have experienced childhood adversities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as they tend to have higher rates of sleep disturbances, making them more vulnerable to feelings of low mood and low energy when faced with work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This dual physiological and psychological pressure often makes these individuals more prone to experiencing job burnout. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet explored the relationship between ACEs and job burnout, nor the mediating role of sleep duration in this relationship in nursing interns, especially in countries like China with a large population and heavy nursing workload.</p><p id="Par10">Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between ACEs and job burnout among Chinese nursing interns, and the mediating effect of sleep duration on this relationship. Understanding this relationship might help identify high-risk groups and inform targeted interventions to reduce job burnout, particularly for those early in their careers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2333"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par11">From December 2023 to February 2024, a cross-sectional study design was employed using a convenience sampling method to recruit nursing interns from multiple hospitals across Hunan Province, China. The inclusion criteria for the study participants were nursing interns who voluntarily completed the online survey with full responses. The exclusion criteria included interns who provided incorrect answers to quality control items (e.g., &#8220;What is 5 times 12 times 5?&#8221; or &#8220;Which of the following is not an animal?&#8220;). A total of 1105 interns submitted their questionnaire during the study period. After excluding 50 interns who had incorrect answers to quality control questions, 1055 interns remained and were included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec222"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par12">The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the institutional review board at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hunan Province (2023-S189). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, with participants being fully informed about the study&#8217;s purpose, procedures, risks, and their rights. All data collected were anonymized to maintain confidentiality and ensure the privacy of participants.

In the present study, we utilized the Chinese adaptation of the ACE-IQ, which has shown good reliability and validity among the Chinese population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The questionnaire is intended for individuals aged 18 years and older and comprises five dimensions (abuse, neglect, household dysfunction, peer violence/bullying, community and collective violence) and 13 items. Each of the 13 items was categorized as &#8220;ever&#8221; (assigned a value of 1) or &#8220;never&#8221; (assigned a value of 0), resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 13. The cumulative level of ACE exposure was determined by the sum of the scores for the 13 items. Furthermore, participants were categorized into three groups based on their ACE scores, including low levels of ACEs (0&#8211;1), intermediate levels of ACEs (2&#8211;3), and high levels of ACEs (&#8805;&#8201;4), following previous research on the classification threshold of ACEs and the distribution of ACE scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the present study, the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient for the ACE-IQ scale was calculated to be 0.86, demonstrating excellent internal consistency reliability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec236777"><title>Job burnout</title><p id="Par14">The Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) is a validated tool for assessing burnout among Chinese individuals, developed by Professor Li Chaoping and Shi Kan from the Chinese Academy of Sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This scale has been published in the <italic toggle="yes">Acta Psychologica Sinica</italic> and is freely available for academic use and scientific research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Chinese version of the MBI-GS consists of 15 items, each rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (daily). It includes three subscales: exhaustion (5 items), cynicism (4 items), and professional efficacy (6 items). Burnout is indicated by higher scores on exhaustion and cynicism, and lower scores on professional efficacy. The cutoff values for burnout are set at 20 for exhaustion, 16 for cynicism, and 24 for professional efficacy. Job burnout is defined as a positive score in one or more of the dimensions, according to the definition used in previous studies conducted in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study, the Cronbach&#8217;s alpha coefficient for the MBI-GS scale was calculated to be 0.90, demonstrating excellent internal consistency reliability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23677337"><title>Covariates</title><p id="Par15">A set of a priori defined potential confounders of the association between ACEs and burnout and between sleep duration and burnout were included as covariates in all multivariable analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This included sociodemographic and bio-behavioural variables. Sociodemographic information, including age (continuous) and sex (male/female), was collected using a self-designed general information questionnaire. The bio-behavioural variables included participants&#8217; body mass index (BMI) (underweight/normal weight/obesity), smoking (never/ever), drinking (never/ever), physical activity (low/medium/high), and sleep duration (continuous). Smokers were defined as participants who had smoked one or more cigarettes in the past 30 days, consistent with standard definitions used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Current drinkers were defined as those who had consumed at least one alcoholic drink in the past 30 days, following the criteria established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Physical activity was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), with levels of physical activity including low, moderate, and high, based on the standard critical levels of metabolic equivalent (MET) values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. BMI was calculated by dividing weight by the square of height, with underweight and obesity defined as a BMI less than 18.5&#160;kg/m&#178; and higher than 28&#160;kg/m&#178;, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The survey queried the current work shift system with the question &#8220;What is your current work shift system?&#8220;, offering three response options (three-shift rotation, two-shift rotation, and others) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Sleep duration was assessed using the question from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: &#8220;How many hours and minutes did you actually sleep each night in the past month? (Excluding time spent in bed without sleeping).&#8221; The sleep duration was then converted into minutes, in accordance with guidelines established by a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23232"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par16">All data analyses were completed using R 4.0.2 software. Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), while categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentages). The chi-square test was used for the comparison between categorical variables, and the T-test was used for continuous variables. Before applying linear regression and mediation analysis, we assessed the normality of the important continuous variables, and the results indicated that these variables were approximately normally distributed. Linear regression models were used to estimate the association between ACEs and sleep duration and the coefficient (&#946;) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between ACEs and job burnout, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated. Two models were applied in the present study, with adjustment for potential confounders ascertained based on prior publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Model 1 was adjusted for age. Model 2 was further adjusted for sex, BMI, work shift, sleep duration, and lifestyle factors including smoking status, drinking status, and physical activity level. This model adjustment strategy was referenced from the confounding factor control in previous literature on ACEs research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], ensuring that the model progressively controls potential confounders from simple to complex levels. To detect multicollinearity for the linear regression model, we calculated the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for the variables in the regression model. To assess the robustness of the association between ACEs and job burnout, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the ACE score was categorized into four categories using an alternative cut-off value (0, 1&#8211;2, 3&#8211;4, and &#8805;&#8201;5), and the categorical variable was then included in the regression model. To explore potential sex-specific associations, we also conducted a subgroup analysis by sex. Additionally, we further estimated the mediation effect of sleep duration on the association between ACEs and job burnout using mediation analysis. All direct and indirect effects in the models were calculated using bias-corrected bootstrap standard errors based on 5,000 samples. The proportion of the mediation effect was calculated as the ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect. All tests were two-tailed, and the mediation effect was deemed statistically significant if the 95% confidence interval did not encompass 0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par17">Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the baseline characteristics of the study participants.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">The most important findings in this study can be summarized as follows. In line with our expectations, high levels of ACEs exposure were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of job burnout among nursing interns, with sleep duration playing a partial role in mediating this relationship.</p><p id="Par27">Research on job burnout has delved deeper, revealing its multifaceted and complex determinants. Studies indicate that workplace stress and workload are among the primary factors, particularly impacting high-pressure professions like healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Additionally, individual mental health status and coping abilities, such as anxiety, depression, and choice of coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], significantly influence the occurrence and severity of job burnout. There is growing interest in studying the potential predictors of job burnout among medical professions. Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] studied a total of 916 psychiatric nurses, of whom 76.75% had moderate to severe job burnout. Their results also indicated a potential role of perceived organizational support in the development of job burnout. Among the 2268 full-time nurses in 39 hospitals, Chin et al. reported that sleep duration on working days was inversely associated with female nurses&#8217; job burnout in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This finding echoes with a recent study conducted at a tertiary hospital in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, both stress responses and sleep patterns may be influenced by childhood adversities. Research indicates that early-life trauma or stressors can significantly alter stress response systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], predisposing individuals to heightened stress reactivity throughout adulthood. Moreover, childhood adversities have been shown to be correlate with an increased incidence of sleep disturbances, including poor sleep quality and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ACEs have a significant impact on job burnout, and potentially mediated through sleep or stress. However, there is currently a lack of supporting evidence.</p><p id="Par28">To the best of our knowledge, only four studies have explored the relationship between ACEs and job burnout across various occupational groups. For instance, a study conducted in Northern California counties found that physicians with four or more ACEs had significantly increased odds of job burnout (OR: 2.33; 95%CI: 1.17, 6.12) (sample size, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;300) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Another larger-scale study showed that physicians with ACEs had significantly higher prevalence of experiencing one or more burnout symptoms compared with those without ACEs (OR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.29, 1.66) (sample size, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6208) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Additionally, a small-sample study among athletes revealed that those with four or more ACEs were more likely to experience different types of burnout (OR: 1.78; 95%CI: 0.49, 6.46) (sample size, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;75) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, a more recent study using a self-defined burnout assessment found that plastic surgeons with four or more ACEs had significantly higher burnout risk (OR: 7.53; 95%CI: 3.05, 18.60) (sample size, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;252) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. While these studies highlight the impact of ACEs on job burnout, whether this effect persists in early-career populations remains unclear. Our research indicates that nursing interns&#8212;individuals in the initial phase of professional development&#8212;exhibit significant variations in burnout levels due to cumulative ACE exposure. Specifically, nursing interns with four or more ACEs had approximately a 69% higher risk of job burnout. Besides, this study provides evidence that sleep duration may serve as an important mediator, extending the limited existing literature on the association between ACEs and increased burnout odds among nursing interns. Although the confidence intervals in our study were relatively wide, this may be attributed to the variability of the data or the relatively small sample size (similar to the wider confidence intervals observed in the aforementioned studies with smaller samples), and further research with a larger sample size among nursing interns is warranted.</p><p id="Par29">The finding that greater ACEs exposure was associated with an increased likelihood of job burnout among nursing interns can be explained from several perspectives. ACEs can lead to changes in an individual&#8217;s psychological and physiological stress response systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Those who have experienced ACEs may be more sensitive to stressors in the workplace, such as the high demands and pressures of nursing internships. The stress from ACEs may accumulate over time, leading to emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment, which are key components of job burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Regarding the role of sleep duration as a mediator, it is well-known that sleep is crucial for maintaining good mental and physical health. When individuals have experienced ACEs, they may be more likely to have shorter sleep duration or sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Reduced sleep duration can further exacerbate stress and emotional problems, making individuals more susceptible to job burnout. For example, lack of sleep can affect cognitive function, emotional regulation, and the ability to cope with stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], all of which can contribute to the development of job burnout in nursing interns.</p><p id="Par30">This study has significant public health implications. Firstly, it highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing ACEs in the context of nursing education and workforce development. By understanding the relationship between ACEs and job burnout, educators and healthcare institutions can develop targeted interventions to support nursing interns. For example, providing psychological counselling and support services to those with a history of ACEs may help them better cope with stress and reduce the risk of burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Additionally, incorporating ACEs awareness into nursing curricula can equip future healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to identify and manage the psychological effects of early-life adversity. Secondly, the finding about the mediating role of sleep duration suggests that promoting good sleep habits among nursing interns could be an effective way to prevent job burnout. Although the indirect effect through sleep is relatively small, the approximately 13% contribution still highlights the effectiveness of promoting sleep health in mitigating the impact of ACEs on job burnout. This could involve educational programs on sleep hygiene and strategies to manage work-related stress that may affect sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Healthcare institutions could also consider implementing policies that encourage sufficient rest, such as adjusting shift schedules to allow for better sleep, or offering rest spaces within the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Finally, from a broader public health perspective, reducing the impact of ACEs and preventing job burnout in nursing interns can contribute to improving the overall quality of healthcare. Burnout among healthcare workers can lead to decreased patient satisfaction, increased medical errors, and a negative impact on the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. By addressing these issues early in the careers of nursing interns, we can potentially improve the long-term well-being of the healthcare workforce and the quality of care provided.</p><sec id="Sec5333"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par31">Despite the valuable findings of our study, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, our study employed a cross-sectional design, which limits our ability to establish causal relationships. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the temporal sequence between ACEs, sleep duration, and job burnout. Secondly, the data were collected from hospitals in Hunan Province, China, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other regions or countries. Cultural and healthcare contextual differences could influence the relationship between ACEs and job burnout, and future studies should include diverse geographic and cultural samples to enhance the generalizability of the results. Thirdly, although we adjusted for several potential covariates, other unmeasured confounding factors, such as individual personality traits and perceived occupational stress, may also play a role in the relationship between ACEs, sleep duration, and job burnout. Future studies should consider incorporating more comprehensive measures to account for these factors. Additionally, the self-report nature of the questionnaires used in our study may introduce some measurement error and bias. This includes the potential for social desirability bias, where participants may have provided responses that they felt were more socially acceptable rather than their true experiences, especially in the self-report of ACEs. To mitigate this, future research could incorporate objective measures, such as actigraphy for sleep assessment, and more detailed clinical evaluations of ACEs to enhance the accuracy of the data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that greater ACE exposure was associated with an increased likelihood of job burnout among nursing interns, with sleep duration playing a partial mediating role in this relationship. These findings highlight the critical role of sleep duration as a modifiable factor, suggesting that sleep-focused interventions (e.g., promoting regular sleep schedules or addressing sleep disturbances) may serve as a pivotal preventive strategy to mitigate job burnout during the early career stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
