Traditional treatments have not been deemed to show the degree of efficacy necessary to address the crisis. The authors of this review paper have set forth an unprecedented and in-depth look into multi-factorial determinants that have contributed to the opioid crisis becoming global and multi-faceted.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods:</title><p id="P2">For this narrative review/opinion article, we searched PsychINFO, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant articles on topics including the &#8220;opioid crisis,&#8221; &#8220;opioid mechanisms,&#8221; &#8220;genetics and epigenetics,&#8221; &#8220;neuropharmacology,&#8221; and &#8220;clinical aspects of opioid treatment and prevention.&#8221; Since this was not a systematic review the articles selected could represent unitential bias.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results:</title><p id="P3">Despite some success achieved through Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) in harm reduction, the annual mortality toll in the US alone surpasses 106,699 individuals, a figure expected to climb to 165,000 by 2025. Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&#8217;s (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health (NSDUH) reveals that approximately 21.4% of individuals in the US engaged in illicit drug use in 2020, with 40.3 million individuals aged 12 or older experiencing a Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Provisional figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate a troubling 15% increase in overdose deaths in 2021, rising from 93,655 in 2020 to 107,622, with opioids accounting for roughly 80,816 of these deaths.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p id="P4">We advocate reevaluating the &#8220;standard of care&#8221; and shifting towards inducing dopamine homeostasis by manipulating key neurotransmitter systems within the brain&#8217;s reward cascade.

The current approaches, such as providing opioids to combat opioid dependence, may be ineffective and akin to administering alcohol to an alcoholic until death. Merely focusing on harm reduction is insufficient, and a holistic treatment approach is essential to address addiction&#8217;s physiological, psychological, spiritual, and societal dimensions. It is vitally important to delve into the history, root causes, mode of progression, and multi-factorial areas that are contributing to the spread and persistence of addiction and the fashion in which it has become a global pandemic. The authors of this paper carefully and meticulously explore all these areas from different disciplines and levels of expertise, offering a comprehensive look at these problems while offering effective solutions to eradicating the global addiction crisis.</p><sec id="S6"><title>Present opioid crisis statistics</title><p id="P6">CDC data indicates that opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States surged to 80,411 in 2021, a notable increase from 68,630 the previous year, with synthetic opioids contributing to 72.9% of these fatalities. The American Surgeon General has forecasted that opioid overdoses will claim the lives of at least 165,699 individuals in the country in 2025, primarily attributed to the heightened potency of fentanyl [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The opioid addiction crisis extends beyond national borders, constituting a global epidemic with staggering societal costs. A bipartisan report by the American Medical Association (AMA) revealed that overdose deaths exact a toll of approximately $1 trillion annually in the United States. Recent statistics released on February 8, 2022, indicated that more than 106,699 individuals succumbed to overdoses in 2021 alone. Non-medical opioid use has been associated with the loss of 12.9 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), reflecting years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death. From 1999 to 2019, nearly half a million individuals perished from opioid-related overdoses, encompassing both prescription and illicit opioids [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Some participants showed signs of recovery, reducing the risk of relapse. This underscores the potential for brain recovery from heroin-induced injury and suggests that treatment should be maintained for at least three years. However, genetic reward gene polymorphisms were not assessed in Zou et al.&#8217;s study [<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Formal genetic testing could aid clinicians in determining appropriate treatment duration, as heroin addiction treatment should extend beyond detoxification to address underlying genetic vulnerabilities and provide long-term neuroscience-based interventions.

Utilizing contemporary neuroimaging tools and studying hereditary risk factors, including epigenetic modifications, will enable the clinical community to provide better care for individuals addicted to opiates/opioids. An effective translational approach integrating cognitive neuroscience, animal research, and correlational techniques in humans, such as genome-wide and candidate polymorphism analysis, is necessary to elucidate the complex etiology of addiction and guide targeted interventions [<xref rid="R118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>].</p><p id="P50">According to specific theories, an addicted endopheno-type may not be specific to the substance of choice but may generalize to altered brain reward circuits affecting net mesocorticolimbic dopamine release. Gondre-Lewis et al. [<xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] proposed that dopaminergic reward circuits can be genetically or epigenetically altered, potentially leading to uncontrollable drug intake. For example, decreased dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) availability has been associated with increased sensitivity to opioids. Expanding on this concept, Gondre-Lewis et al. conducted a comprehensive polymorphism risk analysis in a human cohort of chronic opioid users, revealing a higher frequency of the polymorphic DRD3 risk allele (rs6280) compared to the opioid receptor 1 in African Americans (rs1799971). These findings suggest that dopamine-related receptors, particularly DRD3, may predominantly influence opioid-seeking behavior among African Americans, underscoring the importance of attention to DRD3-mediated modulation of dopaminergic homeostasis for the development of novel neuropharmacological therapies targeting OUD [<xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Furthermore, the hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) system has been implicated in both positive and negative drug reinforcement, with HCRT receptor 1 (HCRT-R1) signaling implicated in drug-related behaviors across various drug classes, including opioids. Schmeichel et al. [<xref rid="R120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] demonstrated that systemically administered NBI-80713 dose-dependently decreased heroin self-administration in animals with extended access, modeling the transition from controlled to compulsive-like drug use. Additionally, they found an increase in Hcrtr2 mRNA levels in the central amygdala, a stress-related brain region, in animals with extended heroin access, suggesting a functional role for HCRT-R2 signaling in compulsive-like heroin self-administration. These findings highlight HCRT-R2 antagonism as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of heroin dependence.</p><p id="P51">The modulation of pain and analgesia involves the Mu-opioid receptors (MORs), representing a candidate mechanism for developing biomarkers of pain conditions and treatment responses. Comparing homozygotes with OPRM1 G carriers, studies revealed an overall reduction of baseline &#956;-opioid receptor availability in regions implicated in pain and affective regulation. Moreover, G carriers showed more pronounced mood disturbances, lower placebo-induced &#956;-opioid system activation in several brain regions, and lower levels of dopamine D2/3 activation in the NAc. Additionally, G carriers reported higher NEO-Neuroticism scores at the trait level. This indicates that the A118G OPRM1 polymorphism contributes to interindividual variations in neurotransmitter function responsive to pain and highlights its role in modulating pain perception and placebo responses [<xref rid="R121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>].</p><p id="P52">The introduction of depressive symptoms, including social withdrawal, is considered a leading cause of relapse. Lutz et al. [<xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] demonstrated that delta and kappa opioid receptor (DOR and KOR, respectively) knockout mice develop more substantial or reduced emotional disruption during heroin abstinence, establishing DOR and KOR activities as protective and vulnerability factors, respectively, that regulate the severity of abstinence. Moreover, these investigators found that chronic treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine prevents the emergence of low sociability, with no impact on the working memory deficit, implicating serotonergic mechanisms predominantly in the emotional aspects of abstinence symptoms. Finally, targeting the main serotonergic brain structure, Lutz et al. [<xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] show that gene knockout of MOPRs in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) before heroin exposure abolishes the development of social withdrawal. These findings help us understand opioid system-mediated serotonin homeostasis in heroin dependence.</p><p id="P53">Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), a retinoic acid (RA) synthase, is selectively expressed by the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (nDA) neurons that preferentially degenerate in Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). ALDH1A1-positive axons mainly project to the DS. Pan et al. [<xref rid="R123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] found that &#956;-type opioid receptor (MOR1) levels were severely decreased in the DS of postnatal and adult Aldh1a1 knockout mice. In contrast, the dietary supplement of RA restores its expression. Furthermore, RA treatment also upregulates striatal MOR1 levels and signaling.</p><p id="P54">Pharmacological and electrophysiological evidence has shown that opioid receptors are involved in the mechanism of heroin dependence. The MOR, OPRM1, has long been a high-priority candidate for human genetic studies of addiction. The G allele showed a modest protective effect on general substance dependence (OR = 0.90, 95% C.I. [0.83 &#8211; 0.97], p-value = 0.0095, N = 16,908 [<xref rid="R124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The stress axis is regulated, in part, by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin, acting on MORs. Individuals carrying one or two copies of the G allele of the MOR gene (OPRM1 A118G) may have higher receptor binding for beta-endorphin compared with A.A. homozygotes, contributing to individual differences in cortisol reactivity to stress. Lovallo et al. [<xref rid="R125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] measured cortisol in 251 young adults (69 GA/GG vs 182 AA genotypes) exposed to mental arithmetic plus public speaking stress relative to a resting control day. Women had smaller cortisol responses than men (F = 10.2, p = 0.002), and women with G.A. or G.G. genotypes (N = 39) had an absence of cortisol response relative to A.A. carriers (N = 110) (F = 18.4, p &lt; 0.0001). Male genotypes had no such difference in response (F = 0.29). Cortisol response following MOR blockade using naltrexone in 119 subjects unmasked a more significant tonic opioid inhibition of cortisol secretion in women (N = 64), consistent with their blunted stress reactivity. Compared with men, women may have cortisol stress responses that are more heavily regulated by endogenous opioid mechanisms, and the OPRM1 GA/GG genotypes may affect females differentially relative to males. Diminished cortisol responses to stress may affect health behaviors in women with GA/GG genotypes.</p><p id="P55">In summary, research demonstrates that opioid signaling regulates the net release of dopamine in the NAc in the mesolimbic area of the brain through various polymorphic genes associated with neurotransmitters and second messengers. The leading associations of these reward genes are wellness, stress-coping abilitity, incentive salience (wanting), and motivation. Notably, Carlsson, Greengard, and Kandel received the Nobel Prize in 2000 for their research on dopaminergic activity&#8217;s molecular and cellular role in neurons. Serotonin, endorphins, glutamate, and dopamine were all comprehensively described in the historical and significant psychopharmacological study by Blum et al. on the role of neurotransmitters and associated behaviors [<xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Prescribed opioids and easy availability are the primary causes of the second and deadliest opioid epidemic the United States has ever seen. Currently, the clinical consensus is to treat OUD with long-term to permanent opioid replacement treatment, treating it as though it were an opioid deficiency condition. Similar to how insulin is used to treat diabetes, opioid agonist administration has been considered by some to be essential to make up for lost opioids, treat OUD, and prevent overdoses. In that opioid, clinicians believe that agonist MATs are seen as a crucial component of therapy, OUD and addiction treatment are conceptualized similarly to endocrinopathy [<xref rid="R125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>].

These adaptations in key brain areas are integral to the three recurring stages of the addiction cycle: 1) binge/intoxication, characterized by the acute rewarding and reinforcing effects of drug consumption; 2) withdrawal/negative affect, involving unpleasant physical and emotional symptoms during abstinence; and 3) preoccupation/anticipation, marked by craving the drug in response to internal and external cues [<xref rid="R127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Notably, the interconnectedness across these stages may elucidate the pattern of opioid-seeking behavior, involving heavy consumption followed by periods of abstinence and, ultimately, relapse, often to alleviate negative emotionality [<xref rid="R128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] or in response to anticipatory motivation. However, it is worth noting that the exact mechanism of action underlying the molecular neurobiological events associated with the euphoric effects of opioids remains a topic of debate and controversy, with potential variations depending on the specific substance or behavior of choice.</p><p id="P57">However, the role of dopamine signaling, particularly in neurons projecting from the well-characterized VTA to the NAc, is paramount in mediating associations between drug-taking and reward, thereby reinforcing these associations each time drug consumption is repeated and strengthening the links between the drug and internal as well as external cues.

Environmental stimulation initiates the release of serotonin in the hypothalamus, which in turn, for example, via 5 HT-2 A receptors activates (green equal sign) the subsequent release of opioid peptides from opioid peptide neurons. Then, in the Substantia Nigra, the opioid peptides move to two different opioid receptors with different effects. One is through the MOR that inhibits (red hash sign) GABAA neurons (possibly via an opioid peptide like enkephalins). The second stimulates cannabinoid neurons (for example, the Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) (green equal sign) through beta-endorphin-linked delta receptors, which inhibit GABAA neurons. When activated, cannabinoids, primarily the 2-arachidonoylglycerol neurons, can disinhibit (green hash sign) GABAA neurons indirectly by G1/0 coupled to CB1 receptor activation. The Glutamate neurons in the DRN disinhibit GABAA neurons in the Substantia Nigra indirectly through GLU M3 receptor activation (green hash sign). When disinhibited, GABAA neurons will powerfully inhibit (red hash signs) VTA glutaminergic drive via GABAB 3 receptors. At the NAc, Acetylcholine (ACH) neurons may inhibit (red hash sign) muscarinic and stimulate nicotinic (green hash) receptors. Glutamate neurons in the VTA will project to dopamine neurons through (NMDA) receptors (green equal sign) to definitively release dopamine at the NAc [<xref rid="R132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].</p><p id="P59">From our perspective, the debate regarding the precise role of dopamine in reward processing remains ongoing, although we have proposed that craving dopamine represents a distinct phenomenon from liking it. Blum et al.

By imbuing reward-related stimuli with incentive salience, dopamine may facilitate: a) the hedonic effect of reward (liking), b) learned predictions about rewarding outcomes, and c) the pursuit of rewards (wanting). Blum&#8217;s group [<xref rid="R134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] finds that the incentive salience or &#8220;wanting&#8221; hypothesis of dopamine function is supported by the preponderance of evidence, although we acknowledge that the traditional notion of dopamine&#8217;s role in pleasure induction may require refinement. This is particularly relevant in the context of RDS, where neuroimaging studies have revealed alterations in the brain&#8217;s reward system elicited by addictive substances, palatable meals, and anticipated behaviors such as sex and gaming, suggesting bidirectional effects [<xref rid="R135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>].</p><p id="P60">It is widely accepted that addictive substances share three standard features: voluntary self-administration, enhancement of dopaminergic synaptic activity in the NAc, and activation of the brain&#8217;s reward system to produce the sought-after &#8220;high&#8221; in drug users. Increased stress levels, dopaminergic genes polymorphisms, and other genetic variations in neurotransmitter systems are believed to collectively contribute to an individual&#8217;s vulnerability to addiction. These circuits are now recognized as functionally more complex, encoding attention, reward anticipation, disconfirmation of reward anticipation, and incentive motivation, in addition to their previously attributed role in setting the hedonic tone.

Assessing four substances (alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, and other drugs) and ten behaviors, File et al.

Based on structural equation modeling with 749 participants, their findings indicate that &#8220;wanting&#8221; increases with the severity, frequency, and intensity of problematic use while &#8220;liking&#8221; remains relatively stable. Moreover, they observed that women exhibit higher levels of &#8220;wanting&#8221; compared to men, and both &#8220;wanting&#8221; and impulsivity positively predict problem usage and behaviors.

This phase of preoccupation and anticipation in the addiction cycle involves the intricate interplay of dopaminergic pathways in the PFC, a brain region closely associated with goal-directed behaviors, self-control, and decision-making, along with the extended amygdala and basal ganglia. Despite ongoing efforts through comprehensive Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and advanced neuroimaging techniques to unravel the complexities of addiction, skeptics like Lewis [<xref rid="R139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] advocate for a &#8220;learning&#8221; model over a purely biological framework. In light of this evidence, caution should be exercised. Furthermore, dopaminergic signaling in the basal ganglia can be augmented through various mechanisms, including those induced by psychoactive drugs like opioids: direct or indirect stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons, increased release of dopamine at terminals, inhibition of dopamine reuptake, or amplification of postsynaptic dopamine actions on NAc neurons.

PTMs of these and other residues on histone N-terminal tails, which protrude from the nucleosome core, alter the steric characteristics and charge distribution of chromatin, regulating DNA-involved processes.

These factors can influence children along developmental trajectories or pathways, capturing risks at various stages of life. For example, early risks like uncontrolled aggressive behavior in young children can escalate when they enter school, potentially leading to peer rejection, teacher punishment, and academic failure. Left unaddressed, these risks may culminate in behaviors like school truancy and association with substance-abusing peers, putting children at immediate risk of substance abuse. By targeting risk factors, evidence-based prevention programs can intervene early in a child&#8217;s development to bolster protective factors and mitigate risks long before problematic behaviors emerge.</p><p id="P77">Adolescent substance abuse and addiction risk factors predominantly stem from external influences; however, certain individual factors also play significant roles in the likelihood of developing a SUD.

For instance, recurrent cocaine use induces alterations in histone acetylation and methylation on Lys residues and DNA within the NAc, albeit not specifically with opioids. Nestler&#8217;s group investigated histone Arg (R) methylation in models of reward processing. According to Damez-Werno et al. [<xref rid="R167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>], the protein-R-methyltransferase-6 (PRMT6) histone mark and asymmetric dimethylation of R2 on histone H3 (H3R2me2a) decreased in the NAc of rodents and cocaine-dependent humans during self-administration procedures. Overexpression of PRMT6 in D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) increased cocaine craving, whereas D1-MSNs overexpression of PRMT6 suppressed cocaine seeking. The theory suggests that dopaminylation (H3R2me2a binding) occurs in psychostimulant use disorder (PSU), and the binding inhibitor Srcin1 mitigates psychostimulant-seeking behavior by normalizing NAc dopamine production, akin to the significant DRD2 A2 allelic polymorphism.</p><p id="P80">Several studies have linked severe cocaine dependence to the DRD2 Taq A1 allele, characterized by fewer D2 receptors. Acute cocaine elevates dopamine levels in NAc synapses, inducing histone H3 glutamine five dopaminylation (H3Q5dop) and subsequently suppressing D2 expression [<xref rid="R168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Chronic cocaine use exacerbates inhibition, a phenomenon persisting after cocaine withdrawal. Additionally, they discovered that during cocaine withdrawal, the Src kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (Srcin1 or p140CAP) decreased H3R2me2a binding. Consequently, the inhibited dopaminylation led to a &#8220;homeostatic brake.&#8221; Similar to the DRD2 Taq A2 allele, a well-known genetic mechanism protecting against SUD, the reduction in Src signaling in NAc D2-MSNs normalizes the production of NAc dopamine. This lowers cocaine reward and motivation to self-administer cocaine, indicating that Srcin1 may be a crucial therapeutic target. Additionally, there is evidence that individuals with the DRD2 A2 allele are protected from developing widespread RDS traits. In a study involving 66 brains of individuals with and without AUD, Noble et al. [<xref rid="R169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>] investigated the allelic relationship of the human D2 dopamine receptor gene with the binding properties of the D2 dopamine receptor. In a blind experiment, a clone (lambda hD2G1) of the human D2 dopamine receptor gene was probed with a 1.5 kilobase (kb) digest of DNA from the cerebral cortex after treatment with the restriction endonuclease TAq. The caudate nuclei of these brains were used to assess the binding properties (Kd [binding affinity] and Bmax [number of binding sites]) of the D2 dopamine receptor using tritiated spiperone as the ligand. Alcoholic subjects had a considerably lower adjusted Kd than non-alcoholic subjects. The Bmax was much lower in individuals with the A1 allele, strongly associated with alcoholism, than in individuals with the A2 allele (protective). Additionally, participants with the A2/A2 allele, A1/A2, and A1/A1 alleles all had progressively lower Bmax values, with A2/A2 subjects having the highest mean values and A1/A1 subjects having the lowest. Many models of addiction causation provide a framework inclusive of biological, social, medical, and psychological factors to understand the complex world of addictions within the multidisciplinary medical, behavioral health, and addictions milieu.

Effective treatment and the commencement of the healing process necessitate embracing a holistic perspective to reinforce and support the recovery journey. Notably, on a neurological level, the mirror neuron system, the default mode network (DMN), reward deficits (RDS) (hypodopaminergia), and spirituality are intricately interconnected.

Multinomial regression models were utilized to examine the co-occurrence of IPT and its interactions with opioid use and misuse indicators. The study revealed a link between IPT and opioid abuse, with the relationship between sexual assault and opiate abuse being particularly complex due to exposure to various IPTs. Among men, opioid abuse was associated with intimate partner violence, whereas among women, adverse childhood experiences and combined sexual assault and intimate partner violence were linked to increased opioid usage.</p><p id="P94">A study conducted by von Oelreich et al.

Using linkage to Swedish health registers, opioid consumption was evaluated both before and after trauma incidents. Among injured patients, logistic regression was employed to explore factors linked with chronic opioid use. Specifically, the analysis involved 13,309 injured patients and 70,621 controls. The findings revealed that exposure to trauma was independently associated with regular opioid use (odds ratio 3.28, 95 percent CI, 3.02 to 3.55). This usage was correlated with factors such as age, low level of education, somatic co-morbidity, psychiatric co-morbidity, pre-trauma opioid use, and severity of injury. Consequently, the authors postulate that traumatic injury correlates with chronic opioid use and poses an elevated risk of mortality within 6 &#8211; 18 months post-trauma.</p><p id="P95">The intensity of PTSD symptoms may also be linked to opioid abuse and dependency in trauma-exposed individuals with chronic pain, potentially influenced by anxiety sensitivity.

A comprehensive data analysis in March 2020 utilized Waves IV (2008) and V (2016&#8211;2018) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to adult health (N = 10,685). It revealed that women (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.19, 2.39 for use; OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 0.95, 1.55 for misuse) and men (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.37, 4.12 for use; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.75 for misuse) were more likely to use and misuse prescription opioids in the aftermath of sexual assault. Diagnoses of depression and anxiety among women (p = 0.0420, p = 0.0450) and prescription opioid abuse (p = 0.0210) mediated the link with prescription opioid use. In men, diagnoses of depression (p = 0.0390) and anxiety (p = 0.038) mediated the connection between prescription opioid misuse and use. Secondary prevention initiatives providing survivors of sexual assault with evidence-based, trauma-informed behavioral health care may mitigate prescription opioid abuse and misuse as coping mechanisms [<xref rid="R182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>].

During this phase, the focus is on examining irrational thoughts and decision-making strategies. At the same time, the individual engages in self-assessment regarding how negative thoughts and emotions impede rational and logical thought processes and learns the skills to manage emotions effectively. This phase encourages participants to delve into the original memory associated with the felt sensation and bodily responses, facilitating release, healing, and integration of fragmented or dissociated aspects into the holistic self.

However, CBT is often touted as an effective treatment for OUD, taking into account various factors such as the severity of addiction, living environment, skill level, past traumas, emotional resilience, and family support. Extensive evidence supports the positive clinical outcomes associated with CBT. Gregory and Ellis conducted a meta-analysis to test the null hypothesis within the random effects model (REM), which posited that the summary effect of CBT + buprenorphine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for OUD and opioid biological sample outcomes equals zero, thus indicating the absence of an effect. However, the initial meta-analytic model yielded insignificant results. Nevertheless, the disparity between these two subgroups was statistically significant.

In cases where trauma and addiction intersect, treatment strategies should include mindfulness interventions tailored to address trauma sensitively. Mindfulness, when approached with trauma sensitivity, helps individuals disengage from the repetitive thought patterns associated with addiction. It empowers them to regain control over addictive thoughts and actively participate in their recovery journey, which is often lifelong.</p><p id="P182">It&#8217;s important to recognize that mindfulness practices emphasize experiential acceptance and present-moment awareness, relying on attention regulation, self-awareness, and emotion regulation skills. While further research on mindfulness is warranted, preliminary findings are beginning to shed light on its neural correlates. For instance, Sezer et al. conducted integrative studies on functional connectivity, trait mindfulness, and mindfulness meditation interventions [<xref rid="R311" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>]. They found that mindfulness practices are associated with functional connectivity changes in key brain networks, including the DMN, frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN). These changes encompass improved communication between brain regions involved in attention management, self-awareness, emotion regulation, and pain alleviation, indicating emerging neural signatures of mindfulness.</p><p id="P183">Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to enhance the resting-state functional connectivity between the frontoparietal executive control network, particularly the DLPFC, and the DMN, specifically the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Kral et al. [<xref rid="R295" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>] observed a heightened T2-T1 PCC-DLPFC resting connection in participants who underwent mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) compared to control groups following mindfulness training. Notably, mindfulness individuals exhibited a significantly stronger connection between practice days (T1 to T3) and enhanced PCC-DLPFC resting connectivity compared to those in the active control group. Furthermore, improvements in microstructural connectivity of the white matter tract linking these regions and self-reported attention enhancements were associated with increased PCC-DLPFC resting connectivity among mindfulness practitioners. These findings suggest that mindfulness practice positively impacts the PCC-DLPFC resting connection. Mindfulness presents an opportunity for individuals grappling with trauma and addiction to reclaim control over their thoughts and emotions, fostering a sense of calm. However, given the complexity of trauma, mindfulness alone may not suffice. Best practices advocate for a trauma-sensitive approach to mindfulness, recognizing its role as a valuable component of treatment and recovery.

When conventional methods like regulated drinking prove ineffective, tailored solutions tailored to specific demographic groups may yield success. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a worldwide mutual support organization, was founded in Akron, Ohio, in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith (Bill W. and Dr. Bob). The primary mission of AA is to inspire alcoholics to maintain sobriety and extend assistance to others striving for sobriety. Wilson, Smith, and early members devised the Twelve-Step spiritual and character development program, which serves as the cornerstone of AA&#8217;s approach. In 1946, the Twelve Traditions were introduced to foster the growth and sustainability of AA. These Traditions advocate for anonymity in public settings, inclusivity of all seeking sobriety, and the altruistic support of fellow alcoholics. Furthermore, the Traditions recommend that AA members refrain from embracing specific ideologies, engaging in political activism, or establishing governing structures when representing the fellowship. Over time, the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions have been adapted and adopted by subsequent organizations to suit their unique missions, as evidenced by groups like Narcotics Anonymous (NA) [<xref rid="R323" ref-type="bibr">323</xref>].</p><p id="P199">AA typically refrains from delving into the medical aspects of alcoholism; however, it is often credited with popularizing the illness hypothesis of alcoholism [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Membership in AA reportedly exceeds 2 million individuals. While the 12-step program and the AA/NA fellowship may exhibit some variances, both can play integral roles in an individual&#8217;s recovery journey. The organization derives its name from the seminal work &#8220;AA: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism,&#8221; also known as the Big Book. Contrary to the notion that individuals with a genetic predisposition to ethanol allergy are destined for a life of addiction, recent insights into neuroepigenetics underscore the impact of environmental factors on polymorphic genes, particularly those linked to the brain&#8217;s reward circuitry.

Investigating the effects of these neurobiological underpinnings on RDS despite addiction risk gene polymorphisms is a worthwhile pursuit. Of particular interest is exploring the potential influence of epigenetic modifications in individuals who regularly attend AA/NA meetings. While further extensive research is necessary, it is worth considering the hypothesis that participation in &#8220;12-step programs and fellowships&#8221; may facilitate neuroplasticity and the continual expansion of dopamine D2 receptors, even in individuals with hypodopaminergic polymorphisms like the DRD2 A1 allele.

However, this approach presents challenges and limitations [<xref rid="R289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>].</p><p id="P225">First, the DSM-5 introduced a significant shift in diagnosing substance-related disorders by omitting terms such as &#8220;abuse,&#8221; &#8220;dependence,&#8221; and &#8220;addiction.&#8221; Instead, severity of SUDs is assessed based on the number of diagnostic criteria met, without distinguishing between individuals with and without addiction. Even individuals with mild or moderate SUDs may exhibit characteristics associated with addiction, as defined by the DSM-5 criteria. Therefore, categorizing individuals as &#8220;preaddiction&#8221; based on mild or moderate SUD severity fails to adequately capture the clinical complexity of addiction.</p><p id="P226">Furthermore, the DSM-5 provides valid diagnostic criteria for mild and moderate-severity clinical presentations, which may still indicate the presence of addiction. Treatment interventions should be tailored based on the severity of clinical manifestations, regardless of whether all criteria for addiction are met. If the concept of &#8220;preaddiction&#8221; aims to facilitate appropriate interventions for individuals at risk of developing addiction, it is essential to identify them using criteria distinct from existing diagnostic categories [<xref rid="R289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>].</p><p id="P227">To clarify, RDS can manifest from birth due to genetic antecedent risk, which may predispose individuals to a heightened susceptibility akin to preaddiction. Moreover, polymorphic DNA antecedents could exacerbate the risk of epigenetic alterations induced by subsequent SUD. We acknowledge that addictive behavioral seeking is a complex interplay of spiritual, neurobiological, and multifaceted psychological factors. We posit that, over time, addiction researchers and clinicians may define preaddiction through various assessments, such as administering the validated RDSQuestionnaire29 (RDSQ29), genetic risk profiling, a modified brain health assessment, or diagnostic categorization of mild to moderate SUD [<xref rid="R337" ref-type="bibr">337</xref>, <xref rid="R338" ref-type="bibr">338</xref>].</p><p id="P228">In a comprehensive meta-analysis of depression, recent GWAS involving millions of participants have identified common comorbidities with SUD, highlighting crucial correlations with the expression of NEGR1 in the hypothalamus and DRD2 in the NAc [<xref rid="R339" ref-type="bibr">339</xref>]. Despite the increasing prevalence of SUD and neuropsychiatric disorders, routine objective brain evaluations are not yet standard practice. The objective of the standardized Brain Health Check (BHC) is to gather pertinent data for the treatment of clinical syndromes in psychiatric patients. The BHC would encompass several reliable, precise, cost-effective, and objective assessments across memory, attention, neuropsychiatry, and neurological imaging domains. Recommended tests for inclusion in the BHC comprise the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (Neuropsychiatric), Quantitative Electroencephalogram/P300/Evoked Potential, CNS Vital Signs (Memory), Test of Variables of Attention (Attention), and over 36 years of diverse computerized and written-based assessments encompassing memory, attention, psychiatric, and neurological imaging (Neurological imaging). To diagnose and address reward dysregulation and mitigate the transgenerational epigenetic transmission of dopamine dysregulation, we advocate for ongoing research into the integration of a novel standard BHC coupled with qEEG/P300/Evoked Potentials and genetically guided precision modulation of &#8220;dopamine homeostasis&#8221; [<xref rid="R340" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>]. The concept of prediction may foster the development of therapies aimed at ameliorating neurotransmitter abnormalities and other early signs of addiction, as well as preventing addiction initiation altogether.</p><p id="P229">While incorporating the RDSQ29 may enhance early detection and stratification of prediction, the GARS test will continue to provide insights into potential DNA antecedents for all addictive behaviors, including OUD. As per Fagiolini et al. [<xref rid="R341" ref-type="bibr">341</xref>], RDS encompasses genetic, neurological, and psychological dimensions of compulsive, impulsive, and addictive behaviors. Data collected from two collegiate and university samples using the RDSQ29 indicated significant associations with impulsivity and sensory seeking. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA) on sample 1 (N = 1726) and confirmatory analysis on a separate sample (N = 253) demonstrated satisfactory fit indices. Construct validity analyses revealed a significant correlation between sensation-seeking and the RDS scale. The RDSQ29, developed through EFAs, comprises four subscales (lack of sexual satisfaction, activity, social concerns, and risk-seeking behavior), with preliminary evidence supporting its utility in evaluating the psychological and behavioral components of RDS. The ongoing refinement of the RDSQ29 by Blum&#8217;s laboratory in collaboration with the Hungarian research team aims to serve as an early-life risk assessment tool for prediction, facilitating the identification of potentially harmful pre-addictive or RDS behaviors through a simple pencil-and-paper index [<xref rid="R137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R342" ref-type="bibr">342</xref>].</p><p id="P230">We conclude by proposing a complementary measure of &#8220;prediction&#8221; derived from RDS, which could further facilitate early detection, staging, and therapeutic intervention for this construct and its optimal characterization. The heuristic utility of our proposal will be evaluated based on its ability to encompass specific clinical, genetic, and therapeutic aspects of the prediction phenomenon. Further research is warranted to elucidate the distinctive features of RDS in addictive versus other psychiatric and medical conditions, as well as their interactions in comorbid states. Our central contention is that early genetic testing is paramount for identifying prediction or RDS in children [<xref rid="R134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="R135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>].</p><p id="P231">Donald Meichenbaum, in his book &#8220;Treating Individuals with Addictive Disorders,&#8221; posits that both opioid and dopamine circuits play pivotal roles in addiction. The dopamine system is particularly active during the initiation and maintenance of drug use and other addictive behaviors, serving as a linchpin for the reinforcing patterns of various substances, including alcohol, stimulants, opiates, nicotine, and cannabis. Desire, wanting, and yearning, all driving forces behind addictive behaviors, are intricately linked to dopamine function, extending to non-drug addictions as well [<xref rid="R343" ref-type="bibr">343</xref>]. Conversely, opioids primarily modulate the pleasure-reward components of addiction, whether intrinsic or extrinsic. These circuits, intertwined with dopamine pathways, constitute integral components of the limbic system, often referred to as the emotional brain, which processes a spectrum of emotions such as love, joy, pleasure, pain, wrath, and fear. Emotions, serving a fundamental survival function, regulating attachment, and aversion drives essential for human survival. While our emotional brain typically guides us toward nurturing experiences and away from threats, maladaptive coping mechanisms, including addiction, may arise when its function is compromised [<xref rid="R344" ref-type="bibr">344</xref>].</p><p id="P232">In infancy and early childhood, attachment bonds serve as pivotal environmental factors shaping brain development during periods of maximal growth, as outlined by Daniel Siegel in &#8220;The Developing Mind.&#8221; The immature brain leverages the adult functions of the parent&#8217;s brain through interpersonal connections fostered by attachment, with many reward gene polymorphisms predisposing individuals to addictive-like behaviors. These genetic antecedents, compounded by epigenetic influences, heighten susceptibility to both substance and behavioral addictions, contributing to a spectrum of psychological and behavioral issues such as anxiety, depression, and aggression. Children often mimic their parents&#8217; behaviors and coping strategies, including addictive behaviors, possibly mediated by mirror neurons [<xref rid="R345" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>].</p><p id="P233">Moreover, recurrent exposure to early Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect and community violence, escalates the risk of addiction. Individuals with four or more ACEs face a significantly heightened risk of alcohol and substance addiction. Traumatic childhood experiences can disrupt brain development, particularly in areas responsible for impulse control, leading to hypersensitivity to stimuli and experiences, as evidenced by phenomena like Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) observed in depression and potentially in ADHD [<xref rid="R345" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>].</p><p id="P234">Adolescent peer pressure can significantly influence the initiation of addictive behaviors. Beginning substance use or abuse in early adolescence within a peer group that also engages in substance use, including smoking, drinking, marijuana, and hard drugs, can lead to the brain becoming dependent on these substances. The earlier substance abuse begins, the higher the risk of developing addictive behaviors in adulthood [<xref rid="R346" ref-type="bibr">346</xref>].</p><p id="P235">Beneath maladaptive behaviors like addiction, a complex interplay of emotions such as fear, anxiety, shame, sadness, resentment, and anger often exist. When individuals lack the skills to manage and release these emotions effectively, they develop coping mechanisms to navigate daily life. The first instance of experiencing relief from overwhelming emotions through substance use ingrains a positive psychological association between the substance and a sense of survival and existence despite the drawbacks of real-life circumstances. This internal split gives rise to belief systems, values, behaviors, and emotions that may contradict logical reasoning [<xref rid="R347" ref-type="bibr">347</xref>].</p><p id="P236">Dr. Gabor Mat&#233; has identified anomalies in the Corpus Callosum (CC), a brain structure facilitating communication between the brain&#8217;s hemispheres, particularly among trauma survivors. Not only have trauma survivors been found to have smaller CCs, but evidence also suggests functional disturbances, potentially leading to a &#8220;split&#8221; in emotional processing. Stress may further exacerbate the disconnect between the brain&#8217;s two halves, hindering the integrated processing of positive and negative emotions [<xref rid="R169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Dr. Martin Teicher suggests that negative and positive feelings may be stored separately in different brain hemispheres, contributing to fragmented perceptions of oneself, others, and the world in intimate relationships and other life domains [<xref rid="R348" ref-type="bibr">348</xref>].</p><p id="P237">Substance addiction typically arises from the convergence of three factors: a susceptible individual, a substance with addictive properties, and stress. Individuals with heightened stress responsiveness may place a premium on substances or activities offering immediate relief while discounting long-term consequences. Exogenous opioid agonists, for example, modulate approach-oriented emotions like pleasure and anger while inhibiting avoidance-oriented emotions like fear and sadness. Prolonged opioid abuse can disrupt circuits involved in social bonding and emotion recognition, impacting overall emotional resilience [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p id="P238">Effective prevention of addiction hinges on emotional regulation and management. Cultivating awareness of thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and their implications is essential. The ability to identify, experience, understand, and release emotions is critical for emotional well-being. As the opioid crisis continues to claim lives, it is imperative to acknowledge the adverse impact of DNA polymorphic antecedents and epigenetic insults on children&#8217;s neurodevelopment. Understanding these challenges underscores the importance of implementing flexible BHC-ups in educational systems to address developmental short-circuits and mitigate high-risk genetic variations [<xref rid="R349" ref-type="bibr">349</xref>, <xref rid="R350" ref-type="bibr">350</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Anti-opioid vaccines</title><p id="P239">There is currently a notable interest in the development of anti-opioid medications, particularly in light of the ongoing public health crisis surrounding OUD and overdose, which has claimed over 100,000 lives in 2023 in the United States alone, primarily driven by fentanyl and its analogues. Immuno-therapeutics, including vaccines, have emerged as potential intervention strategies to complement existing opioid replacement therapies (ORT) and mitigate the incidence of OUD and opioid-related overdose. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of immune therapeutic-based vaccines in clinical practice. These vaccines are specific to each targeted opioid moiety, meaning that a vaccine developed against one opioid, such as codeine, may not effectively block the effects of another opioid, such as heroin. Consequently, individuals dependent on opioids may potentially switch to different opioids, necessitating a multi-vaccination approach to achieve comprehensive protection [<xref rid="R126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>].</p><p id="P240">Despite these challenges, recent studies have shown promising results in targeting structurally distinct fentanyl analogues. Baehr et al. compared various vaccines, including a lead conjugate vaccine (F1-CRM) and novel formulations incorporating haptens derived from alfentanil and acetyl fentanyl (F8, 9a, 9b, 10), to evaluate their efficacy against drug-induced pharmacological effects in rats. While no vaccine provided significant protection against alfentanil, the lead formulations effectively reduced the effects of fentanyl, sufentanil, and acetyl fentanyl, including antinociception, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. Importantly, vaccination with F1-CRM also reduced drug levels in the brains of rats challenged with lethal doses of fentanyl. These findings support further investigation of F1-CRM as a candidate vaccine against fentanyl and selected analogues, warranting expedited review by the FDA for approval to address the urgent need to reduce opioid-related deaths [<xref rid="R351" ref-type="bibr">351</xref>].</p><p id="P241">In light of these insights, several preventive measures are recommended, including parental education:

This comprehensive investigation employed a search strategy integrating pharmacogenomics (PGx) and spine pain as keywords to extract molecular evidence for subsequent bioinformatic analyses. The findings categorized three primary networks: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs), Protein-drug interactions (PDIs), and Gene-miRNA interactions (GMIs). PPI analyses unveiled a primary gene list (PGL) comprising 39 genes. Through PGx Variant annotation assessment, we reviewed 1,460 annotations, identifying 112 PGx-related variants, including 50 structural and regulatory variants and 62 intronic and non-coding variants. PDI results underscored specific compounds such as L-glutamic acid, Memantine, Haloperidol, and Ketamine, which are pivotal in linking pathways. GMI networks highlighted key microRNAs (miRNAs) potentially critical in spine pain management, including hsa-miR-16&#8211;5p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR143&#8211;3p, hsa-miR146a-5p, and hsa-miR144&#8211;3p.

Of particular note, the Fruchterman-Rheingold model of PDIs underscored DRD3 as the principal gene, exhibiting high degrees of betweenness (degrees of betweenness = 4), with compelling PDIs bolstering this assertion. Noteworthy findings include associations of DRD3 with IL6 and TP35 in chronic alcoholic intoxication, alongside implications of DIO1 (a selenium target), DIO2, and DRD3 in thyroid diseases and bipolar disorders, hinting at potential connections to pathways involving exercise and ROS. Moreover, the study identified DRD3 and SEPSECS as critical players in seizures, shedding light on their possible roles in neurological disorders. Of significance, DRD2 and APOE emerged as contributors to PD, which aligns with our earlier discussions on neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, associations were observed between amphetamine-related disorders (involving DRD4 and DRD3) and recurrent depression (involving DRD2 and DRD3), both categorized under addiction. Notably, these findings shed light on the role of D3 receptors in opioid dependence, as emphasized by Gondr&#233;-Lewis, who suggested that while opioidergic mechanisms contribute to OUD, dopamine-related receptors, particularly DRD3, may exert a primary influence on opioid-seeking behavior in African Americans. Consequently, developing novel and enhanced neuropharmacological therapies for OUD may necessitate focusing on DRD3-mediated regulation of dopaminergic homeostasis.</p><p id="P272">Recently and unfortunately, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine concerning an NIH-funded (~400 million) intervention did not impact opioid-related overdose death rates over the evaluation period that was launched in 2019.

Ongoing analyses of the rich data from this study will be critical to guiding our efforts in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P273">The multifactorial evidence presented in this paper underscores the significant role of genetic and epigenetic factors in addiction, highlighting the critical need for early detection. Since the 1990s, Blum&#8217;s groundbreaking discovery has elucidated the intricate interplay between DNA polymorphisms and epigenetics, revealing a balanced influence of nature vs. nurture in shaping developmental trajectories. Blum and colleagues have consistently demonstrated the presence of genetic predispositions, DNA markers, and epigenetic disruptions leading to deficient dopamine levels and &#8220;RDS.&#8221; These findings underscore the urgency of early detection and fundamental diagnostic strategies based on early developmental markers, genetic predisposition, and DNA structure.</p><p id="P274">To address the need for pre-assessment, we advocate for the development of a Comprehensive Early-Childhood Addiction Assessment Kit (CEAAK) comprising direct and observational measurement tools for medical professionals. These assessments should include Multi-Assessment Developmental Tests (MADT), GARS, Awareness Integration Emotional Assessment, temperament/personality trait questionnaires, parental observation questionnaires, and other early childhood measurement tools. The compilation of such assessments will enable the creation of a multisystemic treatment approach and nutrigenomics tailored to the early detection of behavioral addictive markers, which is essential for combating the global opioid addiction crisis.</p><p id="P275">Recognizing OUD as a complex brain disorder necessitates a multifaceted approach that integrates physiological, psychological, and spiritual dimensions. Frontline modalities benefit from incorporating alternatives such as personalized rTMS alongside psychotherapeutic interventions like AIT. Emerging scientific evidence supports the neurochemical benefits of religiosity and spirituality in reducing relapse rates, underscoring the importance of holistic treatment approaches <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S46"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P276">The authors thank Margaret A.
