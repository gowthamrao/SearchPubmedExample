However, how to precisely control the drug release from nanomedicine in tumor tissue and overcome the hypoxic microenvironment of tumor tissue is still an important challenge in the development of nanomedicine. In this work, a new type of drug-loaded nanoparticles P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>-DOX (PA-DOX) was prepared by combining high-efficiency photothermal reagents, critical up-conversion temperature polymer layer and anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this system, CeO<sub>2</sub> can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> alleviate the anaerobic microenvironment of liver cancer cells. As a photothermal reagent, AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> can convert near-infrared light into heat energy to achieve local heat to kill cancer cells and ablate solid tumors. In addition, the elevated temperature would enable the polymer layer to undergo a phase transition to release more DOX to achieve a controlled release mechanism, which will open up a new horizon for clinical cancer treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation&#8217; of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>82272825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9792-7747</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>You</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012542</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFSY0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9792-7747</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>You</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation&#8217; of China in the form of a grant (82272825) awarded to ZY.

The incidence of liver cancer has always been the focus of global health concerns. About 90% of patients with liver cancer are primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The occurrence of liver cancer is closely related to chronic liver disease, especially cirrhosis. Hepatitis B virus [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], hepatitis C virus [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], excessive drinking [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and smoking [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are all risk factors leading to the occurrence of liver cancer. In addition, there are significant gender differences in liver cancer, with males having higher rates of new cases and mortality than females. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells have strong aggressiveness, rapid development of the disease, and easy to metastasize to normal tissues, resulting in poor prognosis of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, which poses a greater threat to the quality of life of patients.</p><p>At present, the treatment methods of HCC mainly include traditional chemical therapy, surgical resection, liver transplantation, radiotherapy, interventional therapy and new immunotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], among which surgical resection has a high therapeutic value in early stage patients, and liver transplantation has the highest curative ability in the treatment of middle and late stage HCC. However, patients with advanced liver cancer lack effective treatment means, and patients often rely on radiotherapy and chemotherapy to barely support the quality of life. However, in the current state of science and technology, systemic radiotherapy and chemotherapy will inevitably have some serious drawbacks, such as high cell toxicity, low tumor specificity, and poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to improve the outcomes of clinical treatment of cancer and the controllability and long-term efficacy of drug therapy, nanomedicine is developed rapidly as a new treatment method. Among them, nanoparticles based photothermal therapy (PTT), as one kinds of the effective non-invasive tumor therapy modalities, has received much research interest in recent years. It uses a Near Infrared (NIR) laser (wavelength 700~1400 nm) to stimulate the photothermal reagent, so that it can convert the absorbed NIR light energy into effective heat energy and kill tumor cells by thermal ablation. It has the characteristics of high selectivity, non-toxicity and easy operation [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Gold nanorods (AuNRs), as a kind of typical PTT reagent, have transverse surface plasmon resonance (TSPR) and longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By adjusting the aspect ratio of AuNRs, the plasmon resonance was red-shifted to the near infrared region, facilitating the PTT with deep tissue penetration [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, compared with other shapes of gold nanomaterials, it not only has higher photothermal conversion efficiency, but also a larger photoacoustic absorption interface, resulting in stronger photoacoustic signals under the same excitation conditions. However, due to the problems of tumor heterogeneity and low photothermal conversion efficiency in deep tissue, the result of single photothermal therapy for tumor eradication is still not ideal. On the other hand, nanomaterials have also been reported to be widely used as effective drug delivery platforms for cancer therapy, including metals, hydrogels, micelles, polymers, proteins and carbon nanomaterials [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, PTT combined with nano-drug delivery systems are thought to effectively treat the tumor.</p><p>Tumor cells show a higher hypoxic level than normal cells due to external stimulation, increased metabolic activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hypoxia has been reported to cause resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can significantly impair the efficacy of cancer treatment [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, alleviating the hypoxia is highly expected during the cancer treatment. Cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles have attracted increasing attention due to their catalase-like activity, which has the ability to convert H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> to relive the hypoxia in tumor tissue to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of the above considerations, in this work, we developed a drug-loaded nanoparticle P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>-DOX (PA-DOX) for the treatment of liver cancer. P(AAm-co-AN) as a kind of upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymers, has been used as drug carriers to deliver chemo-drug to tumor tissue, and its response temperature could be tuned by adjusting the feed ratio of AAm to AN [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Firstly, P(AAm-co-AN) was modified onto the surface of AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>. Then, the anti-tumor drug DOX was loaded inside the P(AAm-co-AN) modified AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to form the PA-DOX. The polymeric layer of P (AAm-co-AN) collapses at low temperatures and limits DOX release. The synthesis procedure of PA-DOX nanoparticles was illustrated in <bold><xref rid="pone.0290237.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Striking</xref> image</bold>. When the PA-DOX nanoparticles were injected into tumor bearing mouse, because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, these PA-DOX nanoparticles would accumulate in the tumor tissue. After being internalized by tumor cells, upon the irradiation by NIR 808 nm laser, the photothermal effect of AuNRs promoted the local heating and triggered the phase change of the P(AAm-co-AN) polymer, causing the polymer chain to be in a stretched state and releasing more DOX to achieve controlled long-term anti-tumor therapy. At the same time, The CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on the surface of Au NRs would catalyze the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, which will alleviate the hypoxia tissue to regulate the anaerobic microenvironment of tumor tissue, potentiating the anti-tumor effect of PA-DOX (<bold><xref rid="pone.0290237.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Striking</xref> image</bold>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials</title><p>Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was purchased from J&amp;K Scientific Technology Ltd.

The body weight and tumor size of the mice were monitored and recorded every two days.The tumor weight did not exceed 10% of the body weight of the nude mice during the tumor growth. Therefore nude mice were sacrificed using 70% carbon dioxide gas to collect tissue samples at 16 d. All animal experiments should comply with the ARRIVE guidelines. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Synthesis of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD</title><p>The UCST-type polymer P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD was prepared via the typical reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) reaction, in which CPTD was used as a chain transfer agent. First, AAm (0.726 g), AN (0.096 g), AIBN (0.0098 g) and CPTD (0.08 g) were dissolved in dioxane (4 mL), and the mixture was deoxygenated through three freeze-pump-thaw cycles under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Then, the mixture was stirred at 65&#176;C and reacted overnight for 24 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled down by ice water and purified by precipitation in cold methanol three times. The final product was obtained by freeze-drying, which was named as P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD.

Moreover, the temperature response performance of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD to form the self-assembled micelles was monitored by measuring the transmittance of the solution as shown in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>. The transmittance of the polymer vesicle solution changed significantly as the temperature increased from 20&#176;C to 60&#176;C. When the test temperature was in the range of 20&#8211;36&#176;C, the micelle solution presented a white emulsion with a transmittance of about 0%, indicating the presence of micelles. When the temperature increased from 36&#176;C to 50&#176;C, the light transmittance of the micells solution increased from about 0% to 100%, clearly indicating the deformation of micelles. In this work, the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of the sample was defined corresponding to the light transmittance of 50% [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It was found that the UCST of P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD was about 42&#176;C, which is slightly higher than the normal body temperature. For P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD, the interaction between acrylonitrile groups helped the polymer overcome the electrostatic repulsion, and shorten the distance between the polymer segments, thus forming the micellar aggregation and improving the probability of hydrogen bonding between the polymers. At low temperatures (&lt; UCST), stable hydrogen bonds were formed between the polymers, allowing them to aggregate and form the micelles in the solution [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

It can be seen that the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of AuNRs (located at 808 nm) shown a red shift to 825 nm after the coating of CeO<sub>2</sub>. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the longitudinal and transverse SPR bands were maintained well without significant broadening, which indicated that the CeO<sub>2</sub> coating did not affected the morphology and the properties of AuNRs.

PA-DOX exhibited the rod-like structure with a size of about 50 nm and an aspect ratio of about 4:1, similar to the morphology of pristine AuNRs.

After the coating of P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD and the loading of DOX, the zeta potential of PA-DOX was greatly reduced, due to the presence of carboxyl groups in the P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD. Furthermore, the mean diameter of AuNRs, AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> and PA-DOX was 50.8, 57.3 and 69.4 nm, respectively. The gradually size increment of different samples also confirmed the deposition of CeO<sub>2</sub> and the modification of P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD on the surface of AuNRs.

Firstly, the concentration of PA-DOX was fixed at 500 &#956;g/mL, and the solution was irradiated by NIR 808 nm laser for 10 minutes with different laser power. The temperature of the solution reached as high as 50&#176;C with the 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> laser irradiation within 10 min, which was in line with the requirement of tumor ablation.

The solution temperature was monitored during this procedure. According to the relationship curve between the cooling time after NIR laser turned off and the negative natural logarithm of the temperature driving force, the photothermal conversion efficiency of PA-DOX was calculated to be 34.5% (<xref rid="pone.0290237.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).

When the temperature is lower than 42&#176;C, DOX was confined inside the aggregated P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD polymer. When the temperature is higher than 42&#176;C, DOX will be released from the swollen polymer. So, this temperature responsible property of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD conferred these PA-DOX a light controlled drug release property due to the photothermal effect. therefore, the temperature sensitive releasing behavior of PA-DOX was evaluated.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0290237.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>. displays the cumulative release of DOX from PA-DOX at different temperatures with/without the NIR laser irradiation. It was found that the cumulative release of DOX from PA-DOX was temperature sensitive. When PA-DOX was maintained in the medium at 37&#176;C, the release of DOX was very slow, and less than 40% of DOX was released from the PA-DOX even after 55 h. As the releasing temperature rose to 50&#176;C, a fast release of DOX was achieved and about 95% of DOX was released after 30 h. This significant difference in release profiles at different temperature was due to the fact that the P(AAM-co-AN)-CPTD segment changed from a collapsed state to a stretched state when the temperature was switched from 37 to 50&#176;C temperature [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which accelerated the release of DOX.</p><p>In this work, PA-DOX exhibits a high photothermal conversion efficiency. After PA-DOX was immersed in the PBS (37&#176;C) for 5 h, this PA-DOX solution was irradiated by 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> 808 nm laser for 10 minutes. The cumulative release of DOX was also investigated as shown in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>. After the laser irradiation, the release of DOX was markedly accelerated. 1 hours post the laser irradiation, compared to the control group (PA-DOX without laser irradiation), an accelerated release of DOX from PA-DOX was clearly observed. For the control group, only 16.4% of DOX was released, while 25.4% of DOX was released from PA-DOX 1 hour post the laser irradiation. The 55-h cumulative release of DOX was about 69%, which was much higher than that released at 37&#176;C from PA-DOX. These results confirmed that under the laser irradiation, PA-DOX achieved excellent photothermal transformation and led to local heating, which triggered the dissociation of the P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD polymer layer and resulted in the fast release of DOX. However, the amount of DOX released from PA-DOX after laser irradiation is less than that from PA-DOX in high temperature (50&#176;C). We think that the laser irradiation only can heat the PA-DOX for a short time. Once the laser is turned off, the PA-DOX will slowly cool down, resulting in a decrease in the dissociation ability of the P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD polymer layer, which consequently weakens the release of DOX. The release of DOX from PA-DOX after repeatedly laser irradiation was also tested as shown in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>. It is observed that each laser irradiation would enhance the release of DOX. Turning off the laser would suppress the DOX release. All these results demonstrated that PA-DOX could realize the controlled release of DOX upon the laser irradiation. This temperature sensitive release of DOX from PA-DOX benefits the therapy of cancer greatly. When these PA-DOX is injected into the body, the DOX would not be released out in the circulation system before PA-DOX reaches the tumor site at the body temperature. When these PA-DOX accumulates in the tumor tissue due to the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, DOX will be directly released out in the tumor tissue upon the laser irradiation. So, this design of PA-DOX will enhance the anti-tumor effect of DOX while reduce the side effect of DOX against the normal tissue.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Effect of PA-DOX on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition and O<sub>2</sub> generation</title><p>The high level of hypoxia in tumor tissues makes tumor cells highly resistant to chemotherapy.

In this work, CeO<sub>2</sub> was deposited on the surface of AuNRs to construct PA-DOX to regulate the anaerobic microenvironment of tumor tissue by virtue of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition ability of CeO<sub>2</sub>.

Around 57.2% and 54.3% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were degraded by Au@CeO<sub>2</sub> and PA-DOX respectively without the laser irradiation in 60 min. When irradiated by NIR laser, both PA-DOX and AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> showed enhanced ability to degrade H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. 80.5% and 81.7% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were decomposed by PA-DOX and AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> after 60 minutes, respectively. The enhanced decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the PA-DOX or AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> solution with the laser irradiation are mostly attributed to the high temperature and the catalysis effect of CeO<sub>2</sub>. The presence of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD on the surface PA-DOX hindered the contact between CeO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thus reducing the decomposing rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by CeO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the solution was also measured to evaluate the generation of oxygen by PA-DOX after the laser irradiation (<xref rid="pone.0290237.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the AuNRs solution is very low within 60 min even after the laser irradiation. This is reasonable that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is stable without the presence of CeO<sub>2</sub>. However, the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in the Au@CeO<sub>2</sub> and PA-DOX rise fast during initial 20 min and then showed a slow elevation thereafter no matter with or without the laser irradiation. These results are reasonable because O<sub>2</sub> mainly comes from the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The presence of CeO<sub>2</sub> greatly accelerates the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to a high concentration of O<sub>2</sub>. At the initial stage, the high concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the solution ensured the high amount of O<sub>2</sub> generated from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Besides, the photothermal effect enhanced the catalytic ability of CeO<sub>2</sub>, which also potentiated the generation of O<sub>2</sub>. Collectively, the super H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition and O<sub>2</sub> generation abilities ensure that PA-DOX can greatly increase the O<sub>2</sub> content to alleviate the hypoxia in the tumor tissue, which facilitates the tumor therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title><italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> cell cytotoxicity</title><p>Before the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> application of PA-DOX, the cytotoxicity of PA-DOX was tested through the MTT assay to evaluate the PTT effect on the anti-tumor ability.

Without the laser irradiation, both AuNRS and AuNRS@CeO<sub>2</sub> showed a cell viability higher than 90%, even the concentration of Au reached 200 &#956;g/mL, indicating their low cytotoxicity. The deposition of CeO<sub>2</sub> on the surface of AuNRs didn&#8217;t show additional cytotoxicity against cells. When these cells were irradiated with 808 nm laser at 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, their cell viabilities were greatly hampered. Even at a concentration of 50 &#956;g/mL, AuNRS showed a reduced cell viability about 74.6%. With the coating of CeO<sub>2</sub> on the surface of AuNRS@CeO<sub>2,</sub> the laser irradiation strengthened the cellular cytotoxicity and the cell viability was about 71.3%. Furthermore, the cell viability of AuNRs+NIR and AuNRS@CeO<sub>2</sub>+NIR is 40.1% and 32.6% respectively when the concentration of Au is 200 &#956;g/mL, clearly demonstrating that AuNRS@CeO<sub>2</sub> showed a slightly higher cytotoxicity than that of AuNRS at same concentration upon laser irradiation. It is reported that tumor cells would resist the photothermal therapy due to the hypoxic environment in tumor tissue. For AuNRS@CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, CeO<sub>2</sub> will decompose H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, which consequently increases the O<sub>2</sub> content in tumor tissue thus relieving the hypoxic degree inside tumor cells.

Although the presence of CeO<sub>2</sub> in PA-DOX would relieve the hypoxia of tumor cells to potentiate the anti-tumor effect of DOX, the retarding release of DOX from PA-DOX would reduce the effective concentration of DOX in the tumor cells which weaken its anti-tumor effect. On the contrary, PA-DOX plus NIR irradiation showed the best cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells. When the DOX concentration of PA-DOX was 2.0 &#956;g/mL with NIR laser, the cell viability reduced to 41.6%, much lower than that of DOX+NIR group (67.8%). Even more, when the DOX concentration was 8.0 &#956;g/mL, the cell viability of cells treated by PA-DOX was less than 20.0%. The good anti-tumor ability of PA-DOX upon the laser irradiation comes from the following reasons. (1) CeO<sub>2</sub> decomposed the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate the O<sub>2</sub>, which relieved the hypoxia and sensitize the PTT and chemotherapy effect of PA-DOX; (2) the photothermal effect of AuNRs accelerated the release of DOX from PA-DOX upon laser irradiation due to the conformation changes of UCST polymer of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD, resulting in a higher effective concentration DOX inside HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the elevated temperature also enhanced the anti-tumor ability of DOX; (3) the photothermal effect of AuNRs would directly kill the tumor cells because of the high temperature. Collectively, PA-DOX showed effective anti-tumor effect against HepG2 cells under NIR laser.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title><italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> cellular migration assay</title><p>In order to further evaluate the antitumor effect of free DOX and PA-DOX on cell viability, the cell migration test was performed using transwell chambers. If More cells transfer from the upper wells to the lower wells, it indicates the better cell viability. <xref rid="pone.0290237.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> shows the images of cancer cells in the lower wells after different treatments. It is clearly seen that the cell migration is affected by different samples. The laser irradiation also affects the cell migration greatly, and the lowest cell migration is observed in cells treated by the PA-DOX plus laser irradiation. <xref rid="pone.0290237.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> shows the corresponding numerical histogram of migrated cell per well observed from <xref rid="pone.0290237.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>. For the control group with the treatment of PBS, the laser irradiation didn&#8217;t affect the cell migration. Compared with the control group, AuNRs and AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> had no significant effect on the cell migration of HepG2 cells (Control (-): 905&#177;28, AuNRs (-): 874&#177;22, AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> (-): 853&#177;18) without laser irradiation, which also confirmed that AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>, as the main body of drug-loaded nanoparticles, had good biocompatibility. However, free DOX and PA-DOX were found to significantly inhibited the cell migration (free DOX (-): 306&#177;17, PA-DOX (-): 305&#177;20) because of the toxicity of DOX. In addition, HepG2 cells treated with PA-DOX showed the lest cell migration with near-infrared light irradiation (PA-DOX(+): 107&#177;9), also confirming the highest cytotoxicity of PA-DOX with the laser irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title><italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> cellular uptake</title><p>The cellular uptake and the localization of free DOX and PA-DOX inside tumor cells were investigated in HepG2 cells at 24 h using confocal microscopy. It can be seen from the <xref rid="pone.0290237.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> that the red fluorescence of DOX and blue fluorescence of DAPI overlapped well in the group treated by free DOX after 4 h of incubation, which was attributed to the high affinity of DOX with nucleic acids. However, the red fluorescence of the free DOX group was weak inside the cells no matter with or without the lase irradiation, illustrating that few DOX could enter the cells. For PA-DOX, stronger red fluorescence of DOX was seen inside the HepG2 cells than that in the free DOX group, which meant that PA-DOX would deliver more DOX into HepG2 cells. After NIR laser irradiation for 10 min, the strongest red fluorescence was observed in PA-DOX treated cells, indicating that NIR laser irradiation induced more DOX released from PA-DOX inside HepG2 cells. After PA-DOX was internalized into the cell through the endocytic pathway and escaped to the cytoplasm, PA-DOX was released and gradually accumulated in the nucleus to exert a cytotoxic effect. These results also explained the highest cytotoxicity of PA-DOX against HepG2 cells.</p><p>In addition, the ability of PA-DOX nanoparticles consuming the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inside tumor cells was also monitored, and the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured as shown in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probe shows green color after its reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Bright green color was observed in the control group without the laser irradiation. The intensity of green color becomes little weak after the laser irradiation, indicating that the NIR laser irradiation alone almost had no effect on the consumption of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, when these HepG2 cells were treated with AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>, the intensity of green color was greatly weakened even without the laser irradiating, which supposed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was decomposed by CeO<sub>2</sub> and there was less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reacting with the probe. For PA-DOX treated cells, the intensity of green color was also weakened. Compared with the cells treated with AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>, PA-DOX consume less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than that of AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> at the same condition. Upon laser irradiation, the weakest intensity of green color was observed in the AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> treated cells, indicating that most of the hydrogen peroxide was effectively decomposed under this condition. The PA-DOX showed comparable H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposing ability to the AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> with the laser irradiation. These results were consistent with the data from the of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition experiment in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title><italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> anti-tumor effect</title><p>In order to evaluate the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity of PA-DOX, we studied its tumor suppression effect on nude mouse model bearing liver tumor. HepG2 cells were used to establish the tumor model, and the nude mice were treated by different samples when the tumor grew to about 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. All samples with or without NIR laser irradiation were studied, and PBS was used as the control. <xref rid="pone.0290237.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> shows the changes of tumor volume within 14 days after the treatment. The tumor volume of PBS group continues to rise within the testing period no matter with or without the laser irradiation, and the tumor volume in the control group became 8&#8211;9 times of the initial size. For AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> group without the laser irradiation, the tumor volume also continued to rise as the control group done, which partly showed the low toxicity of AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub>. When the mice were treated with AuNRs@CeO<sub>2</sub> and laser irradiation, the growth of tumor was suppressed a little due to the combined PTT effect AuNRs and the hypoxic alleviating ability of CeO<sub>2</sub>. For free DOX group, the growth of tumor was greatly retarded due to the cytotoxicity of DOX. The laser irradiation almost had no effect on the antitumor ability of DOX against the tumor bearing nude mice. Interestingly, PA-DOX showed remarkedly tumor inhibiting ability as shown in <xref rid="pone.0290237.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>. During the first 6 days after the initial injection of PA-DOX, the tumor volume of the mice treated with PA-DOX without the laser irradiation became bigger slowly. After 6 days, the size of tumor volume decreased greatly. When the PA-DOX treated mice were irradiated by NIR 808 nm laser at 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, the best tumor growth inhibitory effect was observed. After 14 days, a significant solid tumor ablation effect was observed in PA-DOX treated group. <xref rid="pone.0290237.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref> show the histogram of tumor volume and the corresponding physical photos, which also confirmed that PA-DOX with laser irradiation showed the best <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> anti-tumor effect. In addition, the physiological toxicity of these samples was evaluated by monitoring the body weight changes of nude mice (<xref rid="pone.0290237.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). The PA-DOX didn&#8217;t affect the body weight of the mice during the testing period. Compared with the PA-DOX treated group, it could be seen that the body weight of the free DOX treated group was slightly decreased, indicating that the free DOX exhibited a acute toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0290237.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Due to the existence of AuNRs, nanoparticles had high-efficiency photothermal conversion capabilities. In addition, it had a good controllable drug release effect based on temperature changes, which provided a new idea to control the release of drug on-demand. The experimental results also show that PA-DOX can effectively decompose hydrogen peroxide to H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> with the aid of CeO<sub>2</sub>, which effectively alleviated the anaerobic microenvironment of tumors and strengthen the anti-tumor effect of PTT and chemotherapy. In addition, tumor borne nude mice treated with PA-DOX showed the excellent tumor suppression effect under laser irradiation. And It was found no obvious toxicity compared with free DOX-treated groups. These results indicate that the drug-loaded nanoparticles PA-DOX is a promising new material for the treatment of liver cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;This paper presents a type of drug-loaded nanoparticles PA-DOX for the treatment of liver cancer, in which hydrophobic gold nanoparticles are modified with Upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer P(AAm-co-AN), CeO2 and DOX were loaded in the nanosystem. When the system is irradiated by NIR light, the local heating was produced and triggered the phase change of the P(AAm-co-AN) polymer, simultaneously, CeO2 and DOX were released. Released CeO2 can react with internal H2O2 to generate O2 for relieving the hypoxia of tumor and improving the anticancer effect of DOX. This system seems interesting, however, there are many problems in this manuscript, and some results lack of deep discussion. In my opinion, this manuscript needs major revisions before it can be reconsidered for publication in PLOS ONE, and the following concerns should be well addressed in the revision:</p><p>1&#65294;Please confirm whether hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 in the sentence &#8220;CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O2 and O2&#8221; of abstract are the same substance. (Aren't hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 the same substance?)</p><p>2&#65294;A reference should be cited for the preparation of AuNRs.</p><p>3. To check the mean of the sentence&#8220;The polymer layer of P(AAm-co-AN) appeared to collapse at low temperatures to confine the release of DOX&#8221; in manuscript (page 3, lines 29-30).</p><p>4. The written form of PA-DOX should be unified in the manuscript, P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO2-DOX or P(AAm-co-AN)/AuNRs@CeO2-DOX?</p><p>5&#65294;In formula (2), 2 in H2O should be subscripted; the 4 section, 2 in CeO2 should be subscripted.</p><p>6&#65294;The drug loading content was calculated to be 7.1%, why is the drug loading content in such a low level?</p><p>7&#65294;The photothermal performance experiments of PA-DOX should be provided in experiment section.</p><p>8&#65294;The drug DOX in the nanodrug only releases when the lesion site is irradiated, and the release stops when the temperature in the lesion site drops to the physiological temperature. That means the treatment process is troublesome, otherwise, the drugs loaded cannot be fully utilized. How to explain that?</p><p>9. To check the sentence &#8220;To investigate the oxygen generation ability of PA-DOX, AuNRs, Au@CeO2 or PA-DOX, respectively, all these samples were dispersed in the H2O2 solution with or without the laser irradiation.&#8221; in 3.4 section.</p><p>10. All pictures in the manuscript are blurred. Please provide pictures with high resolution.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The paper titled &#8220;Bioinspired material: Upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer functionalized nanomedicine for controlled drug release and hypoxia alleviation in tumor therapy" reports the Upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer functionalized nanodrugs and the anti-liver cancer activity, in response to near-infrared light release, assisted by gold nanorods and nanoparticles. The nanomase CeO2 catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 to O2, alleviating tumor anoxia and inhibiting cancer cell migration. The paper is suitable for publication in PLOS ONE, but many questions need to be resolved before final acceptance.</p><p>1. Abstract: "CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O2 and O2..." CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O and O2... .</p><p>2. The first paragraph in Introduction has no close connection with the research content of this paper and should be deleted.</p><p>3. &#8220;It can improve the antioxidant capacity and reduce the ROS level to prevent these tumor cells from being killed by PTT or chemotherapy ", does it mean that hypoxia can resist PTT? How does hypoxia resit PTT?</p><p>4. There should be Spaces between numerals and quantifiers, such as "5 mL". The first letter of the word "Figure" should be capitalized. "4 hours" should be shortened to "4 hours", "30 minutes" should be shortened to "30 minutes", and so on, there are many irregularities in writing.</p><p>5. In experiment "2.10", the decomposition of H2O2 should be investigated under the condition of no oxygen.</p><p>6. All cell experiments should clearly indicate the drug dosage and the amount of dye used.</p><p>7. All figures should be improved their resolution.</p><p>8. Draw the synthesis Scheme of nanomaterials in the text.</p><p>9. Gel Permeation Chromatography data for P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD should be provided.</p><p>10. Although morphology, surface finish, Zeta potential and size can provide evidence for the synthesis of materials, these characterizations cannot provide evidence for the existence or disappearance of characteristic functional groups. Therefore, infrared spectrograms are still needed for the characterization of AuNR@CeO2 and PA-DOX.</p><p>11. The unit of light power should be W/cm2 or mW/cm2</p><p>12. Provide experimental data for calculating DOX inclusion rate and drug loading rate.</p><p>13. Provide ROS and O2 level experiments in HepG2 cells.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

We would recommend that you include the following information in your methods section or as Supporting Information files:</p><p>Re: Thank you for the constructive suggestion. In accordance with your suggestion, the details of the NMR measurement and the results were added in the manuscript as highlighted with yellow color.</p><p>1) The make/source of the NMR instrument used in your study, as well as the magnetic field strength. For each individual experiment, please also list: the nucleus being measured; the sample concentration; the solvent in which the sample is dissolved and if solvent signal suppression was used; the reference standard and the temperature.</p><p>Re: Thank you for the constructive suggestion. 1H NMR was carried out using a BrukerAV400 spectrometer (AVANCE III HD 400, Bruker BioSpin Corp., Germany). Briefly, 2 mg of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD was dissolved in 1 ml of deuterated DMSO (d6-DMSO) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard and the 1H NMR spectrum was obtained at room temperature. This revision was added in the experimental section (yellow color).</p><p>2) A list of the chemical shifts for all compounds characterised by NMR spectroscopy, specifying, where relevant: the chemical shift (&#948;), the multiplicity and the coupling constants (in Hz), for the appropriate nuclei used for assignment.</p><p>Re: Thank you for the valuable suggestion. In this work, we measured the 1HNMR OF P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD. The 1HNMR spectrum was shown in Figure 1a. the chemical shift for each chemical group was seen in the spectrum. The main peaks could be attributed to different protons. 1HNMR (400 MHz, DMSO): &#948;= 7.8-6.7 (protons in the benzene ring and -NH2), 3.5-3.6 (polymer backbone, -CH-CONH2), 2.5-2.0 (polymer backbone, -CH-CN), 1.9-1.2 (polymer backbone, -CH2-). All relevant peaks of the hydrogens in the spectrum are labeled in P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD structure. However, because P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD is a kind of polymer with high molecular weight (Mw=18, 900), the multiplicity and the coupling constants of each hydrogen could not be distinguished enough as small organic molecules did. We wish that the reviewer could accept our explanation.

When the system is irradiated by NIR light, the local heating was produced and triggered the phase change of the P(AAm-co-AN) polymer, simultaneously, CeO2 and DOX were released. Released CeO2 can react with internal H2O2 to generate O2 for relieving the hypoxia of tumor and improving the anticancer effect of DOX. This system seems interesting, however, there are many problems in this manuscript, and some results lack of deep discussion. In my opinion, this manuscript needs major revisions before it can be reconsidered for publication in PLOS ONE, and the following concerns should be well addressed in the revision:</p><p>1&#65294;Please confirm whether hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 in the sentence &#8220;CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O2 and O2&#8221; of abstract are the same substance. (Aren't hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 the same substance?)</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O and O2 alleviate the anaerobic microenvironment of liver cancer cells. We have corrected the description.</p><p>2&#65294;A reference should be cited for the preparation of AuNRs.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. The synthesis of aunr is performed by reference to the method described earlier (PMID: 34907215). We have supplemented the description in the Synthesis of AuNRs section.</p><p>3. To check the mean of the sentence&#8220;The polymer layer of P(AAm-co-AN) appeared to collapse at low temperatures to confine the release of DOX&#8221; in manuscript (page 3, lines 29-30).</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. The polymeric layer of P (AAm-co-AN) collapses at low temperatures and limits DOX release. We have revised the description in the manuscript.</p><p>4. The written form of PA-DOX should be unified in the manuscript, P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO2-DOX or P(AAm-co-AN)/AuNRs@CeO2-DOX?</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. We have already unified it as P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO2-DOX.</p><p>5&#65294;In formula (2), 2 in H2O should be subscripted; the 4 section, 2 in CeO2 should be subscripted.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. We have modified the corresponding content according to your request.</p><p>6&#65294;The drug loading content was calculated to be 7.1%, why is the drug loading content in such a low level?</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. The DOX loading capacity (DLC) of PA-DOX was 7.1%, which is normal. Dox Loading Capacity (DLC), also known as DOX loading capacity, is calculated as follows: DLC(%) = (Weight of Drug Loaded / Weight of Polymer+Weight of input Drug)&#215;100 (PMID: 30930305).</p><p>7&#65294;The photothermal performance experiments of PA-DOX should be provided in experiment section.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. We have provided a description of the photothermal performance experiments of PA-DOX in the Methods section.</p><p>8&#65294;The drug DOX in the nanodrug only releases when the lesion site is irradiated, and the release stops when the temperature in the lesion site drops to the physiological temperature. That means the treatment process is troublesome, otherwise, the drugs loaded cannot be fully utilized. How to explain that?</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. This temperature sensitive release of DOX from PA-DOX benefits the therapy of cancer greatly. When these PA-DOX is injected into the body, the DOX would not be released out in the circulation system before PA-DOX reaches the tumor site at the body temperature. When these PA-DOX accumulates in the tumor tissue due to the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, DOX will be directly released out in the tumor tissue upon the laser irradiation. So, this design of PA-DOX will enhance the anti-tumor effect of DOX while reduce the side effect of DOX against the normal tissue. </p><p>9. To check the sentence &#8220;To investigate the oxygen generation ability of PA-DOX, AuNRs, Au@CeO2 or PA-DOX, respectively, all these samples were dispersed in the H2O2 solution with or without the laser irradiation.&#8221; in 3.4 section.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. We have revised the description as follows: To investigate the oxygen-producing capacity of AuNRs, AuNRs@CeO2, and PA-DOX, these samples were dispersed in H2O2 solution with or without NIR laser irradiation.</p><p>10.

We have submitted a clearer figure.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;The paper titled &#8220;Bioinspired material: Upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer functionalized nanomedicine for controlled drug release and hypoxia alleviation in tumor therapy" reports the Upper-critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer functionalized nanodrugs and the anti-liver cancer activity, in response to near-infrared light release, assisted by gold nanorods and nanoparticles. The nanomase CeO2 catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 to O2, alleviating tumor anoxia and inhibiting cancer cell migration. The paper is suitable for publication in PLOS ONE, but many questions need to be resolved before final acceptance.</p><p>1. Abstract: "CeO2 can decompose hydrogen peroxide to H2O2 and O2..."

The first paragraph in Introduction has no close connection with the research content of this paper and should be deleted.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. We think the first paragraph is necessary. In the first paragraph, liver cancer is mainly introduced, because the research object of this paper is human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line (HepG2). In addition, we modified the content of the title and abstract to make them more relevant to the topic.</p><p>3. &#8220;It can improve the antioxidant capacity and reduce the ROS level to prevent these tumor cells from being killed by PTT or chemotherapy ", does it mean that hypoxia can resist PTT? How does hypoxia resit PTT?</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article. I am very sorry that this part of the description is inappropriate. It has been reported that PTT, as a new treatment technique, is not affected by tumor hypoxia (PMID: 30613279). We have updated the description in the text.</p><p>4. There should be Spaces between numerals and quantifiers, such as "5 mL". The first letter of the word "Figure" should be capitalized. "4 hours" should be shortened to "4 hours", "30 minutes" should be shortened to "30 minutes", and so on, there are many irregularities in writing.</p><p>Re: Thank you for your comments on this article.

Gel Permeation Chromatography data for P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD should be provided.</p><p>Re: Gel permeation chromatography (Agilent Technologies PL-GPC 50 Integrated GPC System) equipped with PLgel MIXED Columns (Agilent, particle size: 5 &#956;m; dimensions: 7.5 mm &#215; 300 mm) and a differential refractive index detector was applied to measure the molecular weights and distributions of the copolymers P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD with DMSO as an eluent (0.5 mL&#183;min-1). The molecular weights of samples were calibrated with narrowly distributed dextran standards. The obtained results were shown in Figure S2. From the GPC results, wo obtained that the molecular weight of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD is Mw=18,900. The details about the GPC measurement were added in the experimental section with yellow color.</p><p>Figure S2, The GPC curve of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD, Inset presents the enlarged peak of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD</p><p>10. Although morphology, surface finish, Zeta potential and size can provide evidence for the synthesis of materials, these characterizations cannot provide evidence for the existence or disappearance of characteristic functional groups. Therefore, infrared spectrograms are still needed for the characterization of AuNR@CeO2 and PA-DOX.</p><p>Re: We strongly agree with the reviewer&#8217;s comment. The FT-IR spectrum of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD was shown in Figure S1. In this spectrum the characteristic absorption of -NH2 (3365 cm-1), -CH2- (2910 cm-1), -CN(2225 cm-1), -C=O (1690 cm-1) were clearly seen, which illustrated the successful synthesis of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD. However, for AuNR@CeO2 and PA-DOX, the peaks at 825 nm in the UV-vis spectrum (Figure 1C) are the typical longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of pristine AuNRs (located at 808 nm), which further evidenced the presence of AuNRs. In addition, the peak at 470 nm in the PA-DOX spectrum is the characteristic peak of DOX, which is parallel with the free DOX. From all above results plus morphology, surface change, Zeta potential and size variation, we could conclude that we had obtained all the samples. We hope our explanation can satisfy the reviewer. </p><p>Figure S1, The FT-IR spectrum of P(AAm-co-AN)-CPTD</p><p>11.

According to the reviewer&#8217;s comment, we revised our manuscript.</p><p>Drug loading and release</p><p>The concentration of DOX was evaluated by measuring the UV&#8211;vis absorbance of DOX at 490 nm. Firstly, that, the standard curve of the DOX concentration was set up ( Supplementary Figure S2). To measure the DOX loading efficiency (DLE) and the DOX loading capacity (DLC), 5 mg of DOX was added into 10 mL of PBS with 40 mg of P(AAm-co-AN)-AuNRs@CeO2. and the mixture was stirred over night in dark at 41 oC, followed by dialysis in deionized water to obtain the final product PA-DOX. The DLE and DLC were 81.4% and 9.86% respectively. </p><p>DOX loading efficiency (DLE) = %</p><p>DOX loading capacity (DLC)= </p><p>The effects of temperature, NIR laser and time on the release of DOX from PA-DOX were studied. Firstly, in vitro DOX release was carried out in 20 mL PBS buffer (pH = 7.4). 10 mg of PA-DOX in 2mL of PBS was transferred into a dialysis bag (MWCO = 3.5 kDa) and immersed in above PBS buffer. At each predetermined time point, the dialysis bag was required to be irradiated by NIR 808 nm laser at 3.0 W/cm2. Then the dialysis bag was re-immersed in PBS buffer for 15 minutes to reach a balance. After that, 3 mL of the solution was taken out from the out PBS medium and the absorption value at 490 nm was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer to calculate the concentration of DOX. At the same time, an equal volume of 3 mL fresh PBS buffer was refilled. The experiment was carried out in replicate.</p><p>Figure S3, The Standard curve of DOX obtained from UV-Vis absorbance</p><p>13.

The effect of PA-DOX on ROS and O2 levels in HepG2 cells was not investigated in this paper, which is a limitation of this paper. In addition, we modified the title of the results section in Figure 3 to make it more consistent with the results in this paper.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0290237.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0290237.s006.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0290237.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0290237.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Huang</surname><given-names initials="S">Shigao</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Shigao Huang</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Shigao Huang</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0290237"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
