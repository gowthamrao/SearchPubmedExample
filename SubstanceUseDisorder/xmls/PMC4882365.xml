Previously, a budget impact analysis demonstrated that use of FP and formoterol fumarate (FP/FORM) pMDI as an alternative to FP/SAL pMDI, would be a cost-saving option for the UK National Health Service (NHS). This budget impact analysis aimed to update the existing analysis with prescription volume data and real-world evidence since the introduction of FP/FORM to the UK market.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patient Data (IMS Information Solutions UK Ltd) moving annual total (MAT) August 2015 were used to ascertain the number of units of pMDI prescribed. Annual costs to the NHS in terms of drug, administration, monitoring and adverse event costs, were used to estimate the potential budget impact for FP/FORM and FP/SAL. Costs were calculated for current prescription volumes (12% FP/FORM, 88% FP/SAL), and for different prescription volume scenarios (FP/FORM at 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%). Real-world evidence and budget impact at a clinical commissioning group (CCG) level were also considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Total annual costs per person year were less with FP/FORM (&#163;625) than with FP/SAL (&#163;734). Annual costs to the NHS based on the current prescription volumes and clinical trial data were estimated at &#163;210.0M, however, based on real-world evidence, costs were estimated at &#163;179.8M. For all scenarios with increased FP/FORM prescription volumes, the annual total costs to the NHS decreased. This was reflected at a CCG level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The use of FP/FORM as an alternative to FP/SAL can result in cost savings for the NHS when assessing drug, administration, monitoring and adverse events costs. The inclusion of data released since the launch of FP/FORM within the budget impact analysis demonstrates that the potential cost savings to the NHS that were previously published are being translated to clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p id="Par5">Mundipharma, UK.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Budget</kwd><kwd>Cost</kwd><kwd>Fluticasone propionate</kwd><kwd>Formoterol</kwd><kwd>Pulmonology</kwd><kwd>Salmeterol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mundipharma International</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Healthcare 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Currently, 5.4 million people in the UK are receiving treatment for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which is associated with a substantial economic burden: the annual National Health Service (NHS) expenditure associated with treating and caring for asthma patients, in terms of drug costs, hospital admissions and general practitioner (GP) visits, was estimated to be approximately &#163;1 billion in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">There are a number of treatments available for asthma patients, and combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) inhalers are recommended for the treatment of patients with asthma who are not controlled with ICS alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These combination inhalers are as effective at delivering the drug as individual component inhalers but may provide additional benefits in terms of safety (by ensuring the LABA component is not taken without the ICS component) and patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are two main types of combination ICS/LABA inhaler devices: the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and dry powder inhaler (DPI). Of these two main options, there may be benefits of using pMDIs over DPIs. For example, a recent study demonstrated that pMDIs, as opposed to DPIs, are associated with increased adherence in clinical practice, fewer exacerbations and lower health costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Within the UK, Seretide<sup>&#174;</sup> (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate; [FP/SAL]) has the greatest volume of ICS/LABA units prescribed for the treatment of patients diagnosed with asthma, accounting for 51.8% of the market, and is available within Accuhaler<sup>&#174;</sup> (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) (DPI) and Evohaler<sup>&#174;</sup> (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) (pMDI) device types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">flutiform</italic>
<sup>&#174;</sup> (Jagotec AG, Cambridge, UK) (FP and formoterol fumarate; FP/FORM) pMDI entered the UK market in 2013, and currently accounts for 4.6% of overall ICS/LABA units prescribed for patients with an asthma diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Prior to the introduction of FP/FORM, a budget impact model was developed to evaluate the impact for the NHS of using FP/FORM as an alternative treatment to FP/SAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The comparable efficacy of FP/FORM to FP/SAL had been previously demonstrated in patients aged &#8805;18&#160;years with persistent asthma for &#8805;6&#160;months in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase III non-inferiority study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Based on projected FP/FORM uptake scenarios, the previous model demonstrated that switching from FP/SAL to FP/FORM could result in savings to the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since the introduction of FP/FORM to the UK market, data demonstrating the effectiveness and resource use impact of FP/FORM in real-world settings have become available, which may impact upon the previously modeled outputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The real-world data showed that patients who switched from FP/SAL to FP/FORM had fewer asthma consultations (with or without prescription of oral steroids) (1.4 for FP/FORM versus 1.8 for FP/SAL; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.001) and also confirmed that FP/FORM is non-inferior to FP/SAL in terms of preventing severe exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par10">The aims of this update to the budget impact analysis were twofold: to update the existing budget impact model with prescription volume data since the introduction of FP/FORM to the UK market, and to compare the results of the budget impact model base-case with newly available real-world evidence to evaluate the use of FP/FORM in clinical practice, as compared to FP/SAL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Update of Budget Impact Model</title><p id="Par11">The full methodology of the existing budget impact model has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Furthermore, the update considers real-world evidence, which has become available since FP/FORM entered the market.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Comparators</title><p id="Par12">As with the previous model, Seretide Evohaler (FP/SAL) was considered to be the most appropriate comparator to FP/FORM for analysis of the budget impact to the NHS as it is in the same pMDI device type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to differences in device handling, it was assumed patients were less likely to switch between DPIs and pMDIs, thus DPIs were excluded from the analysis. As discussed in the previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], in the UK it is unlikely that patients would be switched from BDP/FORM to FP/FORM, thus BDP/FORM was excluded from the analysis.</p><p id="Par13">Sirdupla&#8482; (Mylan, Hatfield, UK), a generic FP/SAL launched in June 2015 in the UK, was not considered within the model. This is because FP/SAL is listed as Category C within the drugs tariff in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], meaning that generic prescription prices are linked to the originator brand list price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, Sirdupla is only available in two doses (125 and 250&#160;&#181;g), and due to the recent launch, uptake of Sirdupla was unknown.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis Approach</title><p id="Par14">A budget impact calculation based on drug-related and monitoring costs was performed to estimate the impact of using either FP/FORM or FP/SAL in terms of cost to the NHS, in patients with asthma (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The impact was assessed over a 1&#160;year time horizon, in line with the standard timeframe for NHS budgeting in the UK.

In addition, the specific description of the Patient Data used to ascertain prescription volume has been improved as compared to that used in the previous publication. A recent case study demonstrated that in one Northern Ireland community, 88.3% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;53) of patients were successfully switched from the FP/SAL Evohaler to FP/FORM, which resulted in savings of &#163;111.89 per patient over an 18-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in August 2015, FP/FORM prices decreased (after the publication of the case study). This is likely to further increase savings associated with a successful switch to FP/FORM. Given that the proportion of patients within the community who underwent a successful switch reached 88.3% of patients in the case study from Northern Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the scenario presented in this paper with an FP/FORM share of 50% is a realistic scenario for clinical practice.</p><p id="Par39">Consideration of data from Lim et al. included within the real-world evidence scenario (scenario 1) resulted in a saving to the NHS, indicating that the use of FP/FORM as an alternative to FP/SAL is associated with greater savings in clinical practice, than the costs predicted by the RCT data, subject to a successful switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The difference in costs between the base-case and the real-world scenario was driven by monitoring costs. Patients in the Lim et al. study had fewer GP visits than recommended by the GINA guidelines at the time of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there were still fewer GP consultations associated with FP/FORM than FP/SAL and, therefore, less resource consumption. As the patient population on FP/FORM was the same as that on FP/SAL it is likely that this difference is therapy related, rather than driven by behavior.</p><p id="Par40">Further to this, data from Lim et al. demonstrated that FP/FORM is associated with a lower percentage of severe exacerbations than FP/SAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This suggests that FP/FORM may be associated with fewer hospitalizations and requirements of rescue therapy than FP/SAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, due to the limited detail within the published Lim et al. data, direct comparisons to the RCT data for the base-case scenario could not be made and as such, exacerbation data from Lim et al. were not considered within the model. Furthermore, separate analyses based on this dataset which have been presented at a conference demonstrated that switching patients from FP/SAL to FP/FORM results in non-inferior prevention of severe asthma exacerbations but at a statistically significant lower cost (total respiratory-related healthcare cost per patient was &#163;64 lower for FP/FORM), which is in line with the findings of our analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Another recent study in Spain noted that when comparing the price of FP/FORM with other combinations of ICS/LABA, the price of FP/FORM was significantly lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, over the first 3&#160;years, the Spanish National Health Service is expected to save nearly &#8364;4.4 million from its pharmacy budget with the introduction of FP/FORM for the treatment of moderate to severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, a non-interventional study on safety and effectiveness in Germany reinforced the findings from the clinical trials by demonstrating that FP/FORM improves lung function, asthma control, and asthma related quality of life in a real-world setting: there was a statistically significant improvement compared with baseline in asthma control (as measured by the Asthma Control Test) of patients being treated with FP/FORM over a 3-month period, and there were also improvements seen in terms of quality of life and other secondary efficacy measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">As noted, our analysis demonstrates that an increased uptake of FP/FORM can result in overall cost savings to the NHS without adversely affecting clinical outcomes; there have been several studies comparing FP/FORM with FP/SAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that FP/FORM is at least as effective as, and has a faster onset of action, than FP/SAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, FP/FORM has been recommended as a suitable alternative to other first-line ICS/LABA treatments, including FP/SAL and BUD/FORM, by the Midlands Therapeutics Review and Advisory Committee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The Scottish Medicines Consortium has also recommended treatment with FP/FORM in patients for which FP and FORM are appropriate choices of ICS and LABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The National Institute for Healthcare and Clinical Excellence recommend that for patients in whom treatment with an ICS is considered appropriate, the least costly product should be chosen (within its marketing authorization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In comparison to FP/SAL, FP/FORM is likely to be the least costly option in terms of list price, and overall budget impact to the NHS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">This updated budget impact analysis demonstrates that the use of FP/FORM within the UK market results in potential cost savings to the NHS. Since the launch of FP/FORM, real-world evidence has been generated which corroborates the results of clinical trials and when these data are included within the budget impact analysis, it demonstrates that the potential cost savings to the NHS that were previously published are likely to translate into meaningful changes in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/8784F0600E48598D">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/8784F0600E48598D</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Sponsorship, article processing charges, and the open access charge for this study were funded by Mundipharma, UK.
