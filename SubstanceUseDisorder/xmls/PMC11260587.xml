For state-level tools, we sampled various states and selected tools that serve the entire state. We included tools that the authors had pre-existing knowledge from previous work in substance use disorder research. The discovery of additional tools was conducted via Google searches, focusing on those that met our criteria for broad accessibility and coverage. Two reviewers extracted phone numbers, addresses, and website URLs for all included practices. The reviewers compared results, discussed discrepancies, and reached consensus on any differences in their assessment. The address and phone number for each practice was then validated for these data points via phone call, while the website was validated by searching the websites online.

If a practice stated that they do not offer substance use treatment, it was classified as &#8220;Inaccurate&#8221;, even if the contact information provided was accurate. In order for practice contact information to be classified as &#8220;functionally accurate&#8221;, one of the following situations had to take place: the website or address was inaccurate, but the phone number was accurate and connected you to a live person who could provide correct address and website; the phone number was inaccurate, but the website listed a correct phone number that connected you to a live person; or the phone number connected you to a different practice within the same health system or health network, and you could be directed to the initial practice.</p><p id="p0275">After evaluating the accuracy of contact information, given the lack of normality in our dataset, we conducted Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the exact and functional accuracy rates between national and state tools as well as publicly funded and privately funded tools. We hypothesized that national-level substance use disorder treatment search tools would demonstrate higher exact and functional accuracy rates compared to state-level tools and that privately funded tools would exhibit higher accuracy rates than those funded by public sources. These hypotheses were generated through our team&#8217;s clinical and personal experience with these search tools. STATA 17.0 was used to statistically assess differences in the accuracy of search tools across these dimensions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">StataCorp, 2023</xref>).

National tools demonstrated slightly higher accuracy rates compared to state-level tools, and privately funded tools outperformed government-funded tools. The relatively low accuracy of some tools underscores the challenges faced by healthcare clinicians and patients in effectively navigating treatment options for substance use disorders.</p><p id="p0300">Search tools are one of many potential steps on the pathway to connecting patients to adequate treatment. Their integration with other healthcare services, such as referrals from primary care clinicians or mental health professionals, is essential in forming a cohesive treatment network. However, common barriers, such as stigma, geographical constraints, and financial limitations often hinder access to treatment. In this context, the accuracy of such tools becomes vital in ensuring patients are connected to treatment as reliable information can help with overcoming such access barriers.</p><p id="p0305">The observed low accuracy rates may be attributable to several factors. First, healthcare services, and substance use treatment services in particular, are subject to considerable churn as law, policy, and health demands shift. Additionally, treatment centers may frequently change their services, contact information, and operations. This is compounded by the decentralized nature of US healthcare with a mixture of private and public providers and varying state-level regulations. Second, there might be a gap in collaboration and communication between the entities managing these tools and the treatment providers. For example, national tools may be relying on reporting from state-based entities, which leads to delays and discrepancies in data reporting. Third, funding for certain tools may lapse, leading to a cessation of regular updates. Lastly, there may be insufficient verification processes in place to ensure that the data initially entered was itself accurate.</p><p id="p0310">Our findings support our hypotheses that national and privately funded tools would perform better than state-level and publicly funded tools, respectively. While these differences were not statistically significant, there still may be various reasons for the observed discrepancy in reported accuracy. National tools likely benefit from better financing and a wider scope of service, allowing for more experience and expertise to generate over time. Private tools may have access to more flexible funding streams, enabling them to invest in advanced technology and more frequent data updates. In contrast, public tools may face bureaucratic constraints and relatively limited budgets, which can hinder their ability to update information promptly and invest in technology. This study highlights the critical need for systematic improvements to substance use disorder treatment search tools. Governments and non-profit organizations that host such tools should invest in improving data management strategies to ensure practice information is up-to-date and reliable, including integrating machine learning. Another strategy would be to increase collaboration between the practices and hosting organizations, which has ancillary benefits by fostering stronger partnerships that can help with education and further patient enrichment. Policies should consider building the necessary infrastructure and appropriately financing such endeavors, including incentives to organizations for accurate data. We need to better understand the role these tools play in patients&#8217; pathway to care. Insight from other countries may prove useful. Future research should focus on changes in tool accuracy over time, the efficacy of different data management strategies, and the impact of these tools on patient outcomes, including access to and quality of care as well as substance poisonings.This study had several limitations. First, we did not assess whether tools included real-time availability of access to appointments or vacancies, which are essential for effective locator tools to facilitate timely patient care. Most organizations appear to lack the resources for such updates. Only one tool included in our sample (relink.org) offers treatment slot availability information, but our analysis did not evaluate the accuracy of that particular feature of the tool. Others tools in states not included in our study may also track treatment slot availability and investigating the accuracy of those tools would be a value-added contribution to future research. Second the sample was confined to a limited number of counties in a limited number of states. This may limit generalizability of our findings, but we believe the random sample selection of different size counties in states in different regions of the country strengthened our external validity. Third, not all search tools have the same mission, so the number of practices assessed varied considerably between the tools. Some tools only included practices accredited by their organization, while others were broader. Fourth, the cross-sectional design of this study means that corrections or updates may have been made to some of the tools between when we collected our data and when we validated the data by phone call. Lastly, there may have been some discrepancies arising from classification of phone calls that resulted in extended periods of being put on hold (greater than five minutes); these were classified as &#8220;unable to validate&#8221;.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0315">This study demonstrates that the accuracy of substance use disorder treatment search tools is generally low to moderate, with national and privately-funded tools slightly outperforming state-level and publicly funded ones, respectively.
