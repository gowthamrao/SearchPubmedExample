Despite 40% prevalence in the community, little is known about the prevalence/incidence of UI in older women during hospital admission. UI during hospital admissions, within this group, has also been under-researched in terms of its relationship to specific clinical conditions and mortality rates. Given that UI has serious implications for both patient care and women&#8217;s general health and well-being on discharge, this protocol describes a planned research project which aims to determine mortality, morbidity, prevalence and incidence of UI in older women (&#8805;55 years) during hospital admission to inform nursing practice. Additionally, it aims to explore the experience of nurses who deliver women&#8217;s care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is an explanatory mixed-methods study consisting of two phases: (1) retrospecitive analysis of electronic patient care records (EPCR) to determine prevalence/incidence of UI, clinical conditions most likely associated with UI and any associations between UI and death, (2) nurse interviews to explore views, knowledge and perceptions of performing the nursing assessment and providing care for older women (&#8805;55 years) with UI during admission. EPCR will be gained from a National Health Service (NHS) teaching hospital. Nurse interviews will be conducted with nurses from an alternative but similar-sized NHS hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval is provided by the University of Salford Ethics Committee and regulatory approval by the NHS Health Research Authority (Integrated Research Application System project ID: 303118). Local NHS trust approval to access electronic care records for the purposes of analysis of anonymised data has been provided by one of the two collaborating NHS hospitals. Findings will be disseminated through open-access geriatric or urogynaecology journals and presented to relevant stakeholders at local, national and international meetings including scientific meetings such as the UK Continence Society and International Continence Society.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Urinary incontinences</kwd><kwd>UROLOGY</kwd><kwd>Urogynaecology</kwd><kwd>Bladder disorders</kwd><kwd>Quality in health care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health Education England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The explanatory mixed-methods design allows greater depth of interpretation and understanding of the quantitative data through integration of the qualitative interview themes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analysis of electronic inpatient records will provide insights of the prevalence/incidence of urinary incontinence for older women admitted to hospital and outcome during routine care and enable broader generalisability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of routine electronic nursing assessments across all inpatient wards at a large National Health Service teaching hospital allows insight of nursing practices across a large amount of patient interactions with older women, thereby reducing the impact of local variability of practice and cultural influences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Electronic care records data are from an organisation different to the organisation where interviews will be conducted and therefore it is possible that nurses&#8217; experiences of conducting nursing assessments and knowledge may differ, or not reflect practices at the hospital providing electronic data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Frailty data are calculated using the Leicester Frailty Score, which requires an admission to hospital within the last 24 months within the algorithm; this may result in potential underestimation of the proportion of individuals with frailty.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Urinary incontinence (UI) impacts approximately 33% of older (&#8805;55 years) women<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and can lead to a reduction in their quality of life, reduced psychological health, lack of confidence, feeling of reduced sexuality and societal exclusion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Some women report feeling embarrassment and a sense of taboo related to their continence issues and may not seek help or discuss the matter with others including their partners.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#8211;6</xref> Older women are also less likely to be referred to continence care by their general practitioner than younger women.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The majority of empirical UI research has been conducted in community rather than hospital inpatient settings, and little is known about the prevalence and incidence of UI in older women during hospital addmissions. Additionally, research conducted in community populations has demonstrated that UI is not correlated with increased mortality or significant morbidity. Our review indicated that there is no published literature investigating older women&#8217;s UI and mortality rates in secondary care populations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is also not clear what disease areas or clinical problems increase the incidence or whether UI impacts morbidities, such as frailty, for these women. However, it is known that individuals who are at the end of their life, or in receipt of palliative care, are more likely to experience UI, although they are more likely to be in receipt of catheterisation for their UI.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Causes of UI for older women include a weak/damaged pelvic floor, pressure on the bladder due to obesity<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and/or physiological changes due to menopause. Other issues implicated are an overactive bladder or constipation, drinking alcohol or caffeine, concentrated urine and frequent urinary tract infections.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Certain medications, such as diuretics, anti-depressants, hormone replacement therapy, ACE inhibitors and sedatives, may also cause problems.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Women of advancing age are also at greater risk of UI due to associated conditions being more likely to occur in older age; despite this, UI is not a normal part of ageing.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref></p><p>Some clinical conditions (eg, arthritis, stroke, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia) that limit a woman&#8217;s mobility and ability to easily reach toileting facilities may increase the likelihood of UI. Women with comorbid conditions such as neurological conditions (eg, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis), diabetes, heart failure, hypertension and respiratory disease may also be more likely to experience UI particularly during episodes of exacerbation of their symptoms.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Studies have shown that UI in older women is a contributing factor to both falls and the development of pressure ulcers.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#8211;19</xref> Moisture and/or UI, along with other factors such as immobility, friction, reduced nutritional state, age and comorbid conditions, are all known contributory factors to development of pressure ulcers.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Likewise, immobility and difficulty accessing toileting facilities in a timely way have also been linked to falls.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In turn, both falls and pressure ulcers are associated with frailty and increased mortality in older adults.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>A wealth of patient care information is held by National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, recorded through electronic patient care records (EPCR).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These records include nursing assessments, which help nurses to plan and implement person-centred care. The assessment is based on the activities of daily living<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and includes a person&#8217;s continence status. Assessments are routinely undertaken on admission and repeated either weekly or when the patients&#8217; health condition, clinical status or circumstances change (ie, post-surgery or unplanned clinical event). The assessment includes: (1) their normal continence status prior to admission, (2) continence at the point of admission and (3) repeat continence assessment as previously described. Using EPCR is a useful means to better understand mortality and morbidities (such as frailty and pressure ulcers) and whether there is an association with UI for older women. Prevalence and incidence of UI in older women may also be better understood.</p><p>There is a need to explore the size of the problem in terms of the number (prevalence and incidence) of women (&#8805;55 years) who experience UI during hospital admission and whether their mortality is impacted while an inpatient. Greater understanding is needed of nurses&#8217; (inclusive of the wider nursing team) views, knowledge and perceptions of UI when conducting nursing assessments and caring for women who experience UI during an inpatient admission. This information will inform development of a nursing educational resource which will be tested empirically in future research. Such a resource may help support nurses and others when caring for patients and informing women of helpful self-management techniques and signposting them to other services.

This time period was selected because the electronic nursing assessment was embedded across the hospital on all inpatient wards during this time period, increasing the likelihood of a full dataset. Data beyond February 2020 will not be included due to changes in the nursing assessment that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data related to both the initial admission nursing assessment and any repeated nursing assessments will be retrieved. The following variables will be extracted:</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Demographics</italic>: demographic data collected from electronic patient records will include age at admission and ethnicity. Deprivation deciles will also be calculated using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).

Group comparisons using t-tests and/or &#935;<sup>2</sup> tests will be performed to assess differences between the incontinent and continent groups.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Health characteristics associated with UI:</italic> to determine which health characteristics are associated with UI, binary logistic regression will be carried out with UI (yes/no) as the outcome. Characteristics included in the model as independent variables of interest will be frailty, mobility and BMI. Based on our clinical knowledge and the literature, we have determined age to be a potential confounding factor of this relationship and so this will also be included as a covariate in the model. From these models, we will report the adjusted ORs with accompanying 95% CIs and p values (p&lt;0.05&#8201;will be considered significant for all analyses).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Clinical conditions</italic>: primary and secondary diagnosis data based on ICD-10 codes will be described using descriptive statistics by providing counts and percentages. Binary logistic regression will be carried out with UI (yes/no) as the outcome and clinical conditions will be selected based on current literature (Parkinson&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, dementia, diabetes, heart failure, etc). Confounding factors such as age and BMI will also be included in the model as covariates. From these models, we will report the adjusted ORs with accompanying 95% CIs and p values (p&lt;0.05&#8201;will be considered significant for all analyses).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Mortality:</italic> to determine whether UI is associated with mortality, data will be analysed by all deaths, deaths within 30 days of discharge and deaths within 3 months of discharge.

How many of these confounding variables we will be able to include will be determined by the number of &#8216;events&#8217; (deaths) in the model. If all cannot be included, they will be ranked by likely magnitude of their confounding influence to determine their inclusion in the model.

For pragmatic reasons, nurses to be included in the interviews will be employed at a hospital different to the hospital providing analysis of the women&#8217;s electronic patient nursing records.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Methods</title><p>Semistructured interviews will be conducted on one occasion with 15&#8211;20 (to allow for withdrawal) nurses working on a variety of female or mixed inpatient wards at a large, northern NHS tertiary hospital. Interviews will be with those from the wider nursing team both registered (UK Nursing and Midwifery Council) and non-registered nurses.</p><p>Ward managers will be contacted, by the researchers, and asked for permission to attend ward meetings to discuss the study with staff; both written and verbal information will be provided to potential participants. Informed consent will be taken prior to interviews taking place.</p><p>The interview schedule will be informed by the literature and findings from the quantitative phase of this study. A draft schedule will be developed in consultation with patients with lived experience. It is likely to include participants&#8217; (nurses) experiences of delivering care to older women experiencing UI, their views towards women's UI, as well as their knowledge, education and training pertaining to women&#8217;s UI. It will then be piloted and potential adaptations made.</p><p>Concurrent data collection, data analysis and purposeful participant selection will take place with the themes from interviews influencing selection of the next participant.

We have also engaged with a broad group of ward-based nurses and medical staff who are involved in the care of women admitted to hospital.</p><p>The study is a collaboration between women, clinicians and researchers, which has underpinned development of the study: need, concept, design and delivery plans. At each stage of the study&#8217;s development it has been shared with patients, women of experience and clinicians, the voices of these individuals (and groups) are within all discussions. Our steering group members include women of experience, a geriatrician, a urogynaecologist, a continence nurse specialist, a nursing matron and ward manager, all of whom are in agreement to continue to support development and delivery of the study. Their perspectives and understanding of UI will be drawn on, to enhance clinical understanding of the retrospective quantitative data and the qualitative interview findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study will be conducted in accordance with the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research (Health Research Authority (HRA), 2022). Ethical and research governance approvals for the project have been gained through the University of Salford Research Ethics Committee (REC) (project ID: 2972) and HRA (Integrated Research Application System (IRAS) project ID: 303118; REC reference: 21/HRA/4887) through the NHS IRAS. Approval has also been given by the NHS trust collaborating with us to supply anonymised data in the form of statistical outputs (as described in this protocol) to the research team.</p><p>The principles of Good Clinical Practice guidelines will be adhered to during recruitment of nurses for the qualitative interviews. Potential participants will be provided with both verbal and written information and given at least 24 hours to decide if they wish to participate. To ensure that the participant&#8217;s identity is protected, all personal identifiable information and other potentially identifying (reference to employment or geography) information will be redacted from interview transcripts and final published participant quotes. We will also ensure that participant data are protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018.</p><p>Findings will be disseminated through our study website (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://hub.salford.ac.uk/u-inconti/" ext-link-type="uri">https://hub.salford.ac.uk/u-inconti/</ext-link>), social media, the press, local NHS clinical meetings and events, and at a range of women&#8217;s groups. We will pay particular attention to disseminating outputs to nursing groups such as the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Bladder and Bowel Society and the general RCN annual conference where we might reach a broad group of nurses able to influence practice and policy. Aside from publishing in open-access peer-reviewed geriatric or urogynaecology journals, we will also present findings at national and international scientific meetings such as the UK Continence Society and International Continence Society where clinical staff and researchers are likely to attend.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e232" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-067937.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e234" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
