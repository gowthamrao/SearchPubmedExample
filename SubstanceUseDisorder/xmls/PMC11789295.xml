Studying the manifestation of this disadvantage is crucial for understanding which resources society can provide to mitigate or prevent it, which makes this subject a fundamental public health concern.

Among these are economic indicators such as unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], physical and mental ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], lower well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], negative health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and criminal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many of these associations follow a dose-response relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The processes that lead to or perpetuate disadvantage after adversity can be viewed as vulnerability processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the majority of individuals exposed to CA follow life trajectories comparable to those of individuals without such experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The absence of negative outcomes despite exposure to significant adversity is captured by the concept of resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The capacity for resilience is influenced by the access to relevant resources across the life course, which in turn is shaped by social stratification, including factors such as gender and educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Research on CA is often limited to retrospectively collected, self-reported data, and cross-sectional analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, most studies do not explore outcomes across different life domains simultaneously, such as health and socioeconomic indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, there is still a knowledge gap regarding gender differences in adulthood outcomes after CA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Addressing some of the issues related to data availability outlined above, our study explores longitudinal patterns of disadvantage among individuals with experience of CA in a 1953 Swedish birth cohort. We use administrative records of out-of-home care (OHC) as proxy for CA, and thereby reduce uncertainties related to retrospective self-reports. By considering outcomes across time and including different indicators across health, social, and economic life domains, we discuss resilience and vulnerability as interlinked, but dimension- or outcome-specific processes rather than mutually exclusive opposites. The focus on multiple outcome trajectories among individuals with experience of OHC allows us to explore patterns by gender and education in how resilience and vulnerability may manifest in adulthood.</p><p id="Par8">As a first step, we seek to confirm previously observed associations between OHC and multi-domain adulthood disadvantage using a disadvantage sum-score, and test if this association is moderated by gender. Secondly, we focus on a subset of individuals with experience of OHC, and describe complexity in adulthood outcomes by identifying multi-domain trajectories. Lastly, we explore whether this trajectory approach can contribute to uncovering gender differences in manifestations of resilience and vulnerability. The specific research questions are as follows: (1) What associations are visible between OHC and a disadvantage sum-score in midlife in a representative population sample? (2) In what way, if any, does gender modify this association? (3) Which multi-domain outcome trajectory groups can be identified among adults with OHC experience? (4) What gender differences do we see in terms of trajectory group membership? Across all steps, we consider level of education as a factor that may intersect with gender in producing trajectories of resilience or vulnerability across different life domains.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Childhood adversity and its impact across time and life domains</title><p id="Par9">It is well established that early adversity is associated with increased risks for disadvantage in terms of health, social, and economic indicators up until mid- and old age. CA is for example associated with mental and physical ill health as well as decreased well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, CA also predicts different socioeconomic indicators, including education level and employability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], social welfare receipt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and criminal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These associations are not only observed in isolation: CA emerges also as predictor of complex forms of disadvantage longitudinally and across different life domains, including in earlier investigations based on the same birth cohort as our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Out-of-home care as proxy for childhood adversity</title><p id="Par10">Although self-reported, often retrospective measures of CA, such as the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), show good psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], they also carry a risk of bias, such as differential recall bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One way of reducing the bias induced by retrospective self-reports is to approximate CA via records of OHC. Instances of suspected severe adversity in the family are prevalent among OHC cases, which renders OHC experience a viable proxy for different forms of CA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar to other measures of CA, OHC experience is associated with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and adverse socioeconomic outcomes such as unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the cohort under study here, experience of OHC is, e.g., associated with all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and trajectories of social assistance, unemployment, and mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sex and gender differences in CA exposure and impact</title><p id="Par11">Sex, the biological characteristics of men and women, and gender, the corresponding socially constructed norms, roles, and behaviours, influence health and other life domains across time in interaction with each other, and their respective contributions are hard to disentangle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the following, we give some examples of how sex and gender both influence outcomes in the context of CA. Many of the patterns in these outcomes are shaped by the social construct gender rather than by biological sex (for a framework of gendered pathways to health see Heise et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]). This study therefore discusses possible differences between men and women from a gender perspective.</p><p id="Par12">Already the exposure to CA may vary between boys and girls, depending on the type of adversity and on the context in which it occurs. For example, many studies report that girls are more often exposed to childhood sexual abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and some research indicates that boys are more often victims of physical abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A recent study from Denmark found more complex adversity patterns in girls compared to boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Beyond differences in exposure to CA, there is evidence for more overarching sex or gender differences in the impact of CA, e.g., in terms of health outcomes. Biological sex can play a contributing role, for example through sex differences in the response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. At the same time, also gender may shape CA&#8217;s consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The social norms and roles associated with being a man or a woman in a given context reflect and reinforce societal power structures, which in turn contribute to differences in the resources and the agency an individual has in resisting or recovering from adversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. One example are women&#8217;s more frequent exits from and re-entries into the labour market, and a higher share of unpaid care work at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This may put women in a more vulnerable position compared to men. However, gender norms can also be harmful for men, for example, men are more likely to engage in health risk behaviours when compared to women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given that gender is a structure that encompasses virtually all areas of life, we want to explore gender patterns in resilience and vulnerability in the context of CA. Evidence for differences between men and women with experience of CA can be found, e.g., in terms of specific health outcomes, such as higher rates of internalising disorders in women, even though a meta-analysis failed to produce a statistically significant pooled estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Other examples for gender patterns in outcomes after CA can be found in relation to substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], or in terms of more general outcomes, such as longitudinal mortality patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Findings on gender differences remain inconclusive also for other consequences of CA. With regard to economic indicators, some studies report that women are more severely impacted than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In terms of criminal behaviour, CA is linked to a higher relative risk for women, but in absolute terms, men are still overrepresented, both in the general population and in the CA group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. With regards to multi-domain outcomes, Daining and DePanfilis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] used an index measured at one timepoint and identified that women transitioning out of OHC had fewer problems than men. Similarly, previous research on the same data material as in the current study found that women less frequently experience composite patterns of disadvantage in the wake of CA than men, with mental health problems, social welfare receipt, and unemployment co-occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, men&#8217;s disadvantage patterns have been found to be longitudinally more stable than those among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given these heterogeneous findings across studies, it seems likely that the observable differences between men and women depend on the context, timing of measurement, and type and operationalisation of outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Resilience and vulnerability &#8211; conceptualisation and empirical considerations</title><p id="Par14">CA and its consequences may be explored and understood using the concepts of resilience and vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Together, they form a theoretical framework for describing and understanding experiences of severe stress, as well as the heterogeneity in outcomes following from it. CA more generally, and OHC specifically, are associated with a host of disadvantages. Researchers from various fields are therefore intrigued by individuals that were exposed to CA, but that do at least &#8220;as well&#8221; as individuals from a more favourable background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The process by which resources prevent disadvantage after adversity from accumulating is referred to as resilience, a concept that can be applied to any dynamic system reacting to a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Correspondingly, vulnerability is a process whereby adversity results in disadvantage or loss of functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Resilience and vulnerability play out whenever there is stress on a system (a), and the system responds to said stress in a process that can fluctuate over time (b), leading to an adaptive or maladaptive outcome (c) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Within this basic framework, we can conceptualise resilience and vulnerability as domain- or even dimension-specific. This means that both can play out in parallel, and that we could witness resilience and vulnerability in the same person at the same time. This study therefore approaches resilience and vulnerability holistically, considering different markers of advantage or disadvantage simultaneously, over time, and across different outcome domains. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the interconnectedness of resilience and vulnerability within one such outcome domain. This could be, for example, the health domain. Any individual life domain in turn comprises different dimensions. In the case of health, these could be, for example, mental and physical health. The absence of any disadvantage on one dimension can serve as proxy for resilience in that dimension, while the presence of any disadvantage can correspondingly serve as proxy for vulnerability. The repeated observation of (the absence of) disadvantage across time would then allow for a categorisation of individuals according to a combination of post-stressor trajectories across dimensions in health. Additionally, (absence of) disadvantage at one time point influences the likelihood of (absence of) disadvantage at another time point, both within (d) and across (e) dimensions of health. Furthermore, spill-over effects of resilience and vulnerability do not only occur between different dimensions of the same life domain, but also across life domains. Given that resources available to individuals are often finite, the utilisation of resources within one domain may reduce resource availability in another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, &#8216;success&#8217; or &#8216;failure&#8217; in one domain may constitute a resource or an additional stressor in another. This is in line with ideas concerning the multidimensionality of the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and a conceptualisation of resilience as multisystemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For example, we could imagine an individual that after an adverse event maintains or builds resilience in the social domain, e.g., maintaining a strong network of friends, while becoming increasingly vulnerable in the economic domain, e.g., being employed in a series of precarious job positions.</p><p id="Par15">
<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The figure illustrates resilience and vulnerability as interlinked and yet separate concepts.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e500" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12889_2025_21531_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par16">In empirical studies, resilience has been operationalised in terms of various outcomes: as the absence of illness, for example in terms of depression or anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], as composite measure combining different life domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], or via validated scales such as the Connor-Davidson-Resilience-Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Vulnerability can correspondingly be operationalised in terms of the presence of illness or other forms of disadvantage. Furthermore, conceptualising resilience and vulnerability as processes rather than static requires studies which rely on longitudinal outcome measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Given the heterogeneity in operationalisations of resilience and vulnerability, and the mixed findings on sex or gender differences, contextualisation is key: resilient or vulnerable <italic toggle="yes">to what</italic>, after <italic toggle="yes">what kind of exposure</italic>, in <italic toggle="yes">what kind of setting</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Education as an early marker and enabler of resilience</title><p id="Par17">It is important to note that gender is but one stratifying principle of society, and intersects with many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. For example, socioeconomic status (SES), and level of education in particular, may reflect resources that an individual can access in order to recover from adversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although the SES-gender intersection is not the primary focus of the present study, we acknowledge the plausible influence of SES for processes of resilience and vulnerability. Educational level is a relatively stable marker of social position, and is associated with decreased risks of numerous disease outcomes and better labour market outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the context of OHC, higher educational levels can thus be seen as having a dual function &#8211; they can be both viewed as an early marker of resilience, and as an enabler of resilience moving forward.

Firstly, what is adaptive and conducive to functioning in one setting may be considered maladaptive in another. Secondly, ways in which vulnerability and resilience may manifest are delineated by the structures within which they unfold. Thirdly, the adversity that may set these processes off is shaped by the wider circumstances. Below, we therefore provide a brief overview of the context in which our birth cohort grew up and aged, namely the greater Stockholm metropolitan area in the 1950s and 1960s, with the outcomes being measured in midlife, i.e., in the 2000s and 2010s.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Child welfare services in the 1950s and 1960s</title><p id="Par19">Until the late 1970s, Sweden had higher rates of children being taken into OHC than other comparable countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. At the time, the guiding principle of the child welfare system was child protection. Just as today, placement was arranged when a child&#8217;s health and safety was deemed to be in danger either due to own behaviour or due to family circumstances. In the early days of the Swedish child welfare system, this meant that household dysfunction was viewed as leaving authorities with no choice but to intervene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Only after 1980 was there a change towards accommodating families&#8217; needs more holistically: The Swedish child welfare system transitioned from a heavy emphasis on child protection as a unilateral endeavour to the provision of support on a voluntary basis where possible, with family preservation as guiding principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Social welfare in the 2000s</title><p id="Par20">Universalism and the de-commodification of social rights represent the underpinning core ideas of the Swedish welfare state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In recent decades, there has been a roll-back of public expenditure and an increase of privatisation in numerous sectors, but healthcare provision remains largely free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Accordingly, healthcare seeking behaviour is less restricted by own income and possibly a more accurate representation of the population&#8217;s health needs than in contexts with a strong reliance on out-of-pocket payments. Furthermore, the state provides unemployment benefits via voluntary membership in unemployment insurance funds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and means-tested and health-status related benefits, such as social assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and early retirement benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

</p><p id="Par44">According to the multinomial regression analysis of gender and level of education on trajectory group membership, women were less likely than men to follow multidomain trajectories characterised by complex disadvantage (G4; OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.56, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.046) and unemployment-related disadvantage (G5; OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.51, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.005), compared to the trajectory of no disadvantage.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">In line with previous research, we found OHC experience to be associated with increased odds of disadvantage in adulthood, while higher educational level was protective. Gender did not moderate the association between OHC and disadvantage measures. In individuals with OHC experience, gender differences in disadvantage indicators that could be observed in unexposed individuals were largely not detectable. In that sense, one could see CA as an overriding experience that possibly cancels out any significant life advantage that men might otherwise have over women in terms of, for example, labour market participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">By focusing on individuals with experience of OHC, and decomposing disadvantage from a crude score to multi-dimensional trajectories, we then engaged more closely with gender patterns in relation to resilience and vulnerability after CA. The analyses of multi-dimensional disadvantage trajectories across socioeconomic and health domains showed that men are overrepresented in the two groups with disadvantage in multiple dimensions across domains, G4 (complex disadvantage) and G5 (unemployment-related disadvantage). These are the groups with highest probabilities of both AD and self-harm, as well as substance use and criminal behaviour. In general population samples, we often see a stronger representation of women when it comes to AD and self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In this sub-sample of individuals with experience of OHC, this does not seem to be the case to the same extent. However, there is a clear gender pattern in regard to substance use and criminal behaviour; a greater relative importance of this disadvantage indicator for distinguishing the multi-dimensional disadvantage groups from other groups may be one explanation for men being over-represented in these.</p><p id="Par48">In addition to not following the &#8220;typical&#8221; gender pattern in terms of prevalence of internalising problems, women with OHC experience seem to more often than men experience disadvantage that is limited to one or two dimensions. Women are however overrepresented in G3, the group characterised by disabling health disadvantage. In that sense, one could tentatively argue that once vulnerability manifests for men, it is likely to spill over into other life domains, while in women, vulnerability is more often contained in one domain of life, maintaining resilience in others - with the exception of where health disadvantage translates into an inability to work. Higher educational level is protective of at least some disadvantage patterns. It was not protective for one of the complex disadvantage groups (G5). This could mean that this specific disadvantage pattern is harder to counteract via the resources provided by education, or that men, who were overrepresented in this trajectory group, do not benefit from a higher level of education despite OHC experience to the same extent as women do. As is the case for many other studies on resilience, the majority of individuals with OHC experience are in the trajectory group without elevated risk levels in any of the disadvantage domains. It would be worth exploring in cross-national comparisons how much the &#8220;resilience prevalence&#8221; after comparable exposures and using similar resilience indicators varies between countries, to better understand the gains in resilience that a welfare state system can afford its citizens.</p><p id="Par49">Our findings add nuance to previous studies on patterns of disadvantage in this cohort, where similar patterns were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].We used a different method and slightly different follow-up period, and focused on individuals that experienced OHC due to family-related problems in order to specifically discuss disadvantage within a resilience and vulnerability framework. Furthermore, we added a more varied set of outcome indicators, which captures a wider range of different disadvantages. This increased the chances of describing differences in patterns between men and women in greater detail, and allowed us to approach resilience and vulnerability empirically as fluid and dimension-specific (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">Taken together, what we observe in this study may mean that experience of OHC &#8211; which we here assume to reflect an underlying experience of CA &#8211; levels down the playing field, and evens out parts of otherwise observable gender differences: In the face of adversity, men and women may be more alike in terms of outcome trajectories than would be expected in the absence of it. However, some differences remain, and additionally, it is important to remember that any similarity in outcome trajectories does not mean that the mechanisms leading to these outcomes are the same for men and women. Therefore, research that investigates mediators and moderators of adversity from a gender sensitive perspective is needed to describe resilience and vulnerability in this context in further detail, going beyond a description of (intermediate) outcomes, as this study has done. Our study provided some evidence that education may be a protective factor in the context of OHC experience, and possibly one that women can benefit more often from than men.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par51">The study has several strengths. For example, we used prospectively collected register data, including for the approximation of CA. We furthermore allowed for a complex conceptualisation of resilience and vulnerability via multiple indicators of disadvantage, measured over a relatively long time period. This holistic, longitudinal approach to resilience and vulnerability via register data is new. Furthermore, the sample was relatively large, and we should therefore be able to identify even smaller gender differences. However, additional insights could be gained by adding, for example, more qualitative measures such as subjective indicators of well-being. This would enable a conceptualisation of resilience as something more than the absence of disadvantage, in line with a conceptualisation of health as being more than the absence of disease, and allow for a more context-sensitive understanding of resilience and vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Similarly, future studies, and especially those that aim at causal inference in the context of acute adverse events, would gain by including a measure of pre-adversity functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Despite access to high quality data, there is always risk of bias in estimating associations. Due to the set-up of the birth cohort, people migrating from the Stockholm metropolitan area before their 10th birthday are not included. It does not seem likely that this would impact representativeness of the group of OHC-exposed individuals in this study, as we are not aware of conclusive evidence for differential migration patterns from metropolitan areas by CA experience. Furthermore, in order to reduce overestimation of resilient outcomes, we adjusted for death and migration. Another caveat is health selection, with the most afflicted cohort members dying before the beginning of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is likely to lead to underestimation of the prevalence of all disadvantage indicators.</p><p id="Par53">Using register data also comes with some limitations. Choosing OHC records as proxy for CA implies that we are looking at relatively severe cases. This may negatively impact generalisability to less severe forms of CA, and even more so in as far as OHC experience can be an adversity in its own right [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The underlying assumption of our study is that OHC is a measure taken in the best interest of the child and with the potential to ease the burden on child and family, but we fully acknowledge that this is not always the case and that in some instances, OHC can be an exacerbating factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Furthermore, it was beyond the scope of the current study to investigate events occurring between the experience of OHC and the beginning of follow-up in adulthood. Since the aim was not to determine mechanisms linking adversity and later disadvantage, this does not invalidate our descriptive engagement with longitudinal outcome patterns. However, given that registers capture severe forms of disadvantage, it is likely that the size of the no disadvantage trajectory group is overestimated. At the same time, it is unlikely that this misclassification would vary by gender. Hence, while the group size may be incorrect, this is unlikely to introduce bias in terms of gender patterns. Lastly, it is possible that those gender patterns that we observe in outcome trajectories are in fact due to, or at least co-created by, gender patterns in the exposure. For example, we could imagine that social workers treat girls and boys differently. This is something we cannot capture in our study, but since there are no gender differences in placement length or other placement characteristics, and since we only focused on placements due to family circumstances rather than own behaviour, this seems unlikely. Lastly, our focus on heterogeneity in the outcome meant we neglected heterogeneity in the exposure, which is of interest, too, for it may play a role in type and severity of outcomes observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The choice to not delve deeper into the different types of adversity was pragmatic, partly to ensure a large enough sample for multiple indicators while stratifying by gender and education, partly due to lack of more fine-grained information on the exposure, and partly in order to have one complexity rather than two to discuss. This is an important caveat to bear in mind when interpreting the findings, and Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>a and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>b provide descriptive statistics on those characteristics of placements that we could access. However, with previous studies having confirmed the suitability of using OHC as proxy for CA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we are confident that OHC was fit for purpose in the context of our study.</p><p id="Par54">There are some minor issues with the methodology and conceptualisation within this study that need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings. Firstly, indicators of disadvantage may have been constructed in a way that hides some of the most striking differences between men and women. To avoid this, most indicators covered only one dimension, e.g., unemployment. However, some comprised multiple dimensions across several domains. In this case, we took care to not collapse &#8220;typically female&#8221; and &#8220;typically male&#8221; disadvantage into one indicator. Future studies could benefit from considering additional outcomes. A lack of suitable indicators may also be the reason for the relative lack of observable gender patterns in outcome trajectories, but since we chose proxies for socioeconomic wellbeing and health that usually follow a gender pattern, this seems unlikely. Lastly, Sweden is a relatively gender equal context compared to other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the context in which our cohort grew up and aged was characterised by a strong social welfare system, despite recent cut-backs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This means that the observed patterns are probably not directly translatable to contexts outside of the Nordic countries, or even to other generations within Sweden.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">In conclusion, this study provides a detailed description of the main profiles of adulthood disadvantage in a population exposed to adversity in childhood. As in most comparable studies, the majority of the population does not suffer from lasting observable consequences from the experiences of this adversity. We then exploited the richness of our data to explore gender differences in disadvantage patterns after CA, thus showing how routine data can be harnessed to empirically approach resilience and vulnerability in this context. Even though gender difference became less pronounced in the presence of adversity, it is important to raise awareness about resilience and vulnerability possibly manifesting in multiple ways. Given that this research is set in Sweden, our study provides some evidence that even in relatively gender equal settings, vulnerability and resilience remain gendered to a certain extent. This speaks to the overarching value of addressing gender inequalities on societal level. There was a tendency of men to experience more complex disadvantage, which may be interpreted as greater spill-over effects of vulnerability once resilience has been eroded in one life domain than is the case for women. Conducting similar studies with data from different settings would be beneficial for furthering our understanding of the contribution of gender to manifestations of resilience and vulnerability in men and women. In addition, studies are needed that provide insights into possible gender differences in the pathways along which resilience and vulnerability in the context of CA unfold.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
