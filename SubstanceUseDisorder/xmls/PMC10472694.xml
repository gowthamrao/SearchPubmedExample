Smoking during pregnancy is associated with higher healthcare costs related to birth complications and during childhood. Psychosocial interventions to support pregnant women to quit are effective, yet provision of smoking cessation support has been inconsistent. The Midwives and Obstetricians Helping Mothers to Quit Smoking (MOHMQuit) intervention provides systems change, and leadership and clinician elements, to support clinicians to help women stop smoking in pregnancy. There have been few long-term analyses conducted of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women that target healthcare providers. This protocol describes the economic evaluation of the MOHMQuit trial, a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled implementation trial in nine public maternity services in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to ascertain whether MOHMQuit is cost-effective in supporting clinicians to help women quit smoking in pregnancy compared to usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Two primary analyses will be carried out comparing MOHMQuit with usual care from an Australian health care system perspective: i) a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis with results presented as the incremental cost per additional quitter; and ii) a lifetime cost-utility analysis using a published probabilistic decision analytic Markov model with results presented as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for mother and child. Patient-level data on resource use and outcomes will be used in the within-trial analysis and extrapolated and supplemented with national population statistics and published data from the literature for the lifetime analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">There is increasing demand for information on the cost-effectiveness of implementing healthcare interventions to provide policy makers with critical information for the best value for money within finite budgets.

Maternal death is five times more likely in women who smoke during pregnancy than those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Smoking during pregnancy can have lifelong consequences for infants.

Both forms of exposure can contribute to a number of health conditions in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In Australia, while the rate of smoking during pregnancy has been consistently falling in the last decade, 9.2% of women reported smoking at any time during pregnancy in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Of those who smoked in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (8.8%), the majority (78%) continued to smoke after 20 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women who smoke during pregnancy is stark, with Aboriginal women almost six times more likely to smoke at any time during pregnancy (43.4%) than non-Indigenous women (7.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Higher rates of smoking during pregnancy are also seen among women aged less than 20 (34%), women aged 20&#8211;24 (21%), and those in very remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Globally, it is estimated that healthcare expenditure attributable to smoking-related diseases totalled US$422 billion in 2012, equivalent to 5.7% of global health expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Australian health care expenditure attributable to smoking was estimated to be $6.8 billion in 2015&#8211;16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and tobacco use is responsible for 9.3% of the total burden of disease, greater than any other contributing risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Evidence-based international [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Australian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] guidelines recommend routine, repeated smoking cessation support (SCS) for all pregnant women using brief interventions. This can be undertaken in a few minutes during routine care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], however provision of recommended SCS to pregnant women in Australia has remained persistently poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The missing link is a failure to consistently implement effective smoking cessation care for pregnant women.</p><p id="Par19">Generalisable evidence of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve smoking cessation is necessary to inform policy change at a system-level. A recent review of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women found that interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and nicotine replacement therapy, for both pregnant women and the wider population may be cost-effective from both a health system and a societal perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, these interventions targeted the smokers themselves and, despite evidence that system change interventions for smoking cessation can also be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], few studies have investigated the cost-effectiveness of systems change approaches in the general population or in maternity services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Here we describe in detail the protocol for an economic evaluation of the MOHMQuit intervention. MOHMQuit is a systems-change intervention being tested in a pragmatic trial undertaken in a real-world setting. The intervention includes focused training for maternity service leaders and clinicians to achieve culture change and increase prioritisation of support for smoking cessation, and provides key resources to deliver effective and appropriate SCS to pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The intervention is hypothesised to increase the rates of smoking cessation in pregnancy by improving the provision of guideline-recommended SCS to pregnant women through enhancing clinicians&#8217; knowledge, skills and confidence to provide&#160;SCS to pregnant women. Evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions of this kind is required to implement evidence-based, health system-wide SCS innovations at scale. The aim of this economic evaluation is to explore, from an Australian healthcare system perspective, the cost-effectiveness of MOHMQuit to increase the quit rate of pregnant women who smoke compared to usual care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>MOHMQuit trial</title><p id="Par21">The details of the MOHMQuit intervention and the protocol for the implementation trial are described in detail elsewhere [ANZCTR #382491] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In summary, the MOHMQuit trial is a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial to be implemented in nine public hospitals providing maternity services in New South Wales (NSW). Pregnant smokers will attend a maternity service that, based on their randomised start date for the MOHMQuit intervention, has either received the MOHMQuit intervention or is still in the baseline &#8216;control&#8217; period. All sites will receive the intervention, with continuous data collection occurring throughout the baseline, intervention, washout and follow-up periods for the three years of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The primary outcome is the 7-day point prevalence abstinence among pregnant smokers at the end of pregnancy, confirmed by salivary cotinine testing. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness of the MOHMQuit intervention, rates of documentation of SCS provided, changes in clinicians&#8217; knowledge, confidence, and attitudes to providing SCS, women&#8217;s views on SCS received, and intervention fidelity. The MOHMQuit trial is due to be completed in December 2024.

This will inform the incremental cost per additional quitter analysis. Seven-day point prevalence abstinence with biochemical verification is recommended as an outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and is commonly used in pregnancy smoking cessation trials, as longer timeframes are not relevant to benefits to the foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. It is recognised that this outcome has limitations, in that it is an intermediate outcome and not a measure of health. However, collecting broader outcomes is not practicable in the context of this trial as data will only be collected directly from women in postpartum interviews. Additionally, the myriad physical and social changes that occur with birth and in the early postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] make it difficult to assess whether changes in quality of life outcomes would be due to smoking cessation, the postpartum stage, or other factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Analysis and sensitivity analysis (within-trial analysis)</title><p id="Par28">The cost-effectiveness analysis will use the estimates of cost and effect as described above to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per quitter.

Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken using non-parametric bootstrapping to provide the confidence ellipse, which reflects the uncertainty in the estimate of the ICER. The ellipse provides a region on the cost-effectiveness plane that should contain 95% of the uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

While the within-trial analysis considers the costs and effects of the pregnant women and neonatal costs only across the eight months follow-up, the lifetime model expands the evaluation to include the healthcare costs and health outcomes of smoking behaviour and any changes across the mother and child&#8217;s lifetime. This includes the impacts of the child&#8217;s exposure to secondhand smoke, and that they are more likely to smoke themselves, increasing the likelihood of future smoking-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Model structure (lifetime model)</title><p id="Par31">To conduct the lifetime analysis we will use an adapted version of a published decision analytic model &#8211; the ESIP model, modified for Australian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. ESIP predicts the impact that smoking both in pregnancy and after can have on the lifetime healthcare costs and health outcomes for the mother and her offspring. Using ESIP enables us to expand the evaluation to include the benefits of stopping smoking which occur beyond the short time horizon of the within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p id="Par32">The structure of the original ESIP model is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The model is divided into mother and infant, and within-pregnancy (outcomes and costs during pregnancy), childhood (outcomes and costs for the infant from birth to 15 years) and lifetime (lifetime outcomes and costs for both mother and infant) time periods. The mother&#8217;s component of the model will include the costs of SCS, smoking-related diseases (coronary heart disease [CHD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer and stroke), data on quality of life, relapse rates and transition to smoking-related diseases if the mother relapses. The childhood component of the model will include costs associated at birth for children with smoking mothers if relevant (for premature birth and low birth weight newborns), outcomes related to secondhand smoke exposure in the home, quality of life, smoking uptake rates for children of smokers and associated smoking-related morbidities (asthma, CHD, COPD, lung cancer and stroke).

Cost&#8211;benefit analysis ratios (defined as incremental health-care savings divided by incremental intervention cost) will be produced for the lifetime time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken for the range of areas of uncertainty (informed by the 95% confidence interval or standard error of the mean input value where available) to explore underlying model assumptions. One-way sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to demonstrate the impact of varying specific inputs for: self-reported outcomes; alternative discount rates (3% and 7%); varying relapse rates and changing adherence rates. Two-way sensitivity analysis will be carried out on variables found to substantially increase the ICER in one-way sensitivity analysis, and those which are correlated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken using model parameter distributions for ESIP&#8217;s 390 input variables. Methods used for fitting distributions have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

This study represents one of the few analyses conducted of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions that target antenatal healthcare providers for pregnant women and conducted under &#8216;real world&#8217; conditions. There is increasing demand for evidence of cost-effectiveness of implementation of healthcare interventions to provide policy makers with critical information for the best value-for-money spend on finite budgets. Randomised controlled trials of the clinical effectiveness of interventions and their implementation can provide good opportunities to conduct an economic evaluation alongside the trial, provided the appropriate steps are taken from the outset to ensure that the design of the trial is fit-for-purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Decreasing antenatal smoking to reduce the effects on pregnancy and newborn outcomes is a government priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions is required to implement evidence-based, health system-wide SCS innovations. This study will provide evidence of MOHMQuit&#8217;s costs and benefits to inform decisions on scalability.</p><p id="Par36">The MOHMQuit trial economic evaluation has been planned using available national and international guidelines for conducting economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], promoting greater transparency in the methods undertaken and increasing the rigor and validity of the findings. While it will draw on the MOHMQuit trial results for model inputs, the economic evaluation will adopt its own methods and analysis and results will be reported separately from the main trial without duplicating information. The ESIP model provides a comprehensive approach to estimating costs, outcomes, and long-term cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, of smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Its ability to provide common outcome measures (for example, incremental cost per QALY) allow comparisons between smoking cessation and other healthcare interventions. Where possible, ESIP will be populated with NSW and Australian data, however initial investigations have found that local level data may not be available for all model parameters. The analysis might be strengthened through adaptation of the ESIP model to allow for comparison between population sub-groups with higher rates of smoking in pregnancy. The study will provide essential policy-relevant information for decision makers on the value of evidence-based implementation of support for antenatal healthcare providers delivering SCS for pregnant women.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUD</term><def><p id="Par5">Australian dollars</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p id="Par6">Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHD</term><def><p id="Par7">Coronary heart disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p id="Par8">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESIP</term><def><p id="Par9">Economics of Smoking in Pregnancy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p id="Par10">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOHMQuit</term><def><p id="Par11">Midwives and Obstetricians Helping Mothers to Quit Smoking</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSW</term><def><p id="Par12">New South Wales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p id="Par13">Quality-adjusted life-year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCS</term><def><p id="Par14">Smoking cessation support</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This paper is submitted on behalf of the MOHMQuit Trial team, including all chief investigators, partner investigators and associate investigators, and co-researchers and site leads at each of the MOHMQuit sites.
