Household opioid prescription availability and prescription characteristics for individuals and households were modeled as 6-month cumulative time-dependent measures, updated monthly.

All models incorporated an R-side residual effect with a first-order autoregressive covariance structure to control for correlations between time points within individuals. Random effects for household were tested but not included in the final models due to convergence issues. The first model used a 4-tiered household opioid availability indicator, with no personal or household member opioid fills as the reference category, to examine the relative association of personal and household opioid fills with opioid overdose. This model was adjusted for individual demographic characteristics, number of comorbidities, and household member count. An additional model examined the association between prescription characteristics and opioid overdose, adjusting for individual demographic characteristics, number of comorbidities, household member count, and the percentage of people in the household with an opioid fill. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% CIs, and marginal means. All analyses were conducted with SAS Studio, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), and R, version 4.1.3. Analyses were conducted between October 16, 2020, and January 26, 2023.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-ZOI230134"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1&#8201;691&#8201;856 individuals (1&#8201;187&#8201;140 households; 53.2% women, 46.8% men) were included.

Having both a recent personal and household opioid fill was associated with the greatest odds of overdose, followed by having personal fills only. Even without a personal fill, having another household member with a recent opioid fill was associated with a 60% increase in the odds of opioid overdose. These results suggest that a recent opioid fill to a household member is associated with greater odds of opioid overdose, even after accounting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and personal fills of opioids and benzodiazepines. Findings from this study are consistent with a growing literature suggesting that household opioid availability is associated with increased odds of opioid-related adverse effects in household members.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>While most studies to date have focused on adolescents or young adults in family units who share the same insurance policy number,<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> our study focused on adults who live at the same address and may not be on the same insurance policy or have familial ties. Using this broader definition of household, our findings are similar to those of previous studies reporting that opioid prescriptions to family members significantly increased youth overdose risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Previous researchers have suggested that shared familial genetics, environmental exposures, and norms and behaviors around prescription drug use may account for increased transmission of prescription opioid use through households.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Future studies may explore how the association between household opioid availability may differ between familial and nonfamilial households (eg, roommates, nonmarried intimate partners) and how other sociodemographic household factors may play a role.</p><p>Several household prescription characteristics were associated with an increased odds of opioid overdose, including the percentage of household members with opioid fills, total household dosages greater than 0, and having 1 or more buprenorphine or benzodiazepine fills. To our knowledge, many of these factors have not been previously explored at the household level, but the findings are consistent with studies suggesting that greater access to opioids or benzodiazepines increases overdose risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230134r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> One study examined the role of family member dosage in youth overdose risk, finding only that the highest total dosage to family members (&#8805;600 MME) was associated with increased risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In contrast, we found that all total household dosages greater than 0 were associated with increased overdose odds, suggesting the need for further research to understand the role of household dosage in overdose risk. The finding that buprenorphine is associated with increased odds of overdose is difficult to interpret given that we did not stratify by individuals carrying a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. It is possible that buprenorphine is protective in that case, as buprenorphine therapy for opioid use disorder has been found to decrease the risk of opioid-related overdose.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-10-ZOI230134"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has limitations. We used administrative data not originally designed for research and all analyses were retrospective. The probabilistic linkage method may have sometimes resulted in erroneous matches between files. Insurance claims enrollment files were used to obtain individuals&#8217; addresses; if an individual&#8217;s insurance was lost or changed to an insurance excluded from the APCD, they would not be placed in a household during those periods. As a result, our data may not have captured all household members, and may have sometimes underestimated opioid prescriptions in a household. Due to the nature of the enrollment data, individuals were assigned to households based on the address where they lived most of the calendar year; if they moved during the year, the household assigned to them may not have been accurate for a portion of the year. Because comorbidities were only measured before the study period and we did not require continuous enrollment during 2013 to 2014, some comorbidities may have been missed. Our analysis examined prescriptions filled during the current month plus the previous 5 months; because we also looked for outcomes during the current month, it is possible that in some cases an outcome may have preceded an exposure. We cannot know from our data how many household opioids have been used, disposed of, or diverted to or from other households during the study period, nor do we know what illicit opioids may be in the household. As a result, we do not have a complete picture of total household opioid availability. The choice of a 6-month look back was arbitrary, but our findings are largely consistent with studies using shorter look-back periods.<sup><xref rid="zoi230134r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition, our opioid overdose outcome measure included both illicit and prescription opioids, so we cannot necessarily attribute the overdoses observed in our data to prescribed opioids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI230134"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this large observational cohort study suggest that having recent opioid fills among household members is associated with increased odds of opioid overdose for individuals who live in the same household.
