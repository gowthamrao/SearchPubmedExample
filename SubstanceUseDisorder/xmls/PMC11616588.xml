were published between January 2017 and March 2024 in English; the
population was adults/young people (16 yr+) imprisoned or formerly
imprisoned, in prisons with comprehensive smoke-free policies; and at least
one of the following was reported: pre-release intention to smoke, vape or

internationally, accounting for more than 7.69 million (7.16&#8211;8.20) deaths and
200 million (185&#8211;241) disability-adjusted life-years in 2019, and is still
the leading risk factor for death in men (<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">GBD
2019 Tobacco Collaborators, 2021</xref>). Although smoking rates have fallen in
many resource-rich countries, smoking prevalence remains high among
&#8220;marginalised&#8221; groups (<xref rid="ref038" ref-type="bibr">Potter
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). A systematic review of smoking
prevalence in prisons across 36 countries where smoking was/is still permitted
reported that the rates of smoking were up to five times higher than in the general
population in Europe, up to 6.4 times higher in the Americas and up to 16 times
higher in Asia (<xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">Spaulding <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). For example, in Scotland, in 2017, prior to the 2018
smoke-free prison policy, 68% of people in prison used tobacco compared with
18% of adults outside prison (<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Carnie
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">SHeS, 2017</xref>) and levels of second-hand smoke (SHS) in prisons were
comparable to those within a typical smoking home (<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">Semple <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Thus, people who are
or have been in prison are at greater risk of smoking-related health conditions than
the general population (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Binswanger <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several countries have introduced total smoke-free prison policies to tackle the high
levels of smoking among people in prison, exposure to SHS and tobacco-related
mortality and morbidity for tobacco users and non-users (<xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">Sweeting and Hunt, 2015</xref>). New Zealand was the first country
to implement a comprehensive country-level smoke-free prison policy (<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Collinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).
Smoke-free prison policies have also been implemented in most jurisdictions in
Australia (<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Office of The Inspector of Custodial
Services, 2021</xref>) and in the USA (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Binswanger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and Canada (<xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Collier, 2013</xref>). All prisons in England and
Wales had become smoke-free by July 2018 (<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">ASH,
2018</xref>). Scotland implemented its smoke-free prison policy in November 2018
(<xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">Hunt <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).
UK jurisdictions elected to allow vaping in smoke-free prisons, as have some USA
prisons (<xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">Young-Wolff <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2015</xref>).</p><p>Evidence shows environmental improvements following smoke-free prison policy. For
example, measurements in Scottish prisons, during the week of smoke-free prison
policy implementation, demonstrated an immediate impact (81% reduction in
SHS) (<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">Semple <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2020</xref>); levels were further reduced six months later (<xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">Demou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Other studies have
reported reductions in SHS markers of 77% in North Carolina (<xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">Proescholdbell <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2008</xref>), 50% in New Zealand (<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Collinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and 66% in four pilot
prisons in England (<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have reported evidence of health benefits of smoke-free prison policies.
For example, a USA study reported a 9% reduction in smoking-related deaths,
particularly from heart and lung disease, in prisons where a smoke-free policy had
been in place for nine or more years. There was also a reduction in cancer-related
deaths (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Binswanger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2014</xref>). In England, a reduction in risk of a cardiovascular event across
all ages groups has been evidenced (<xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">Perrett
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). In Scotland, a time-series analysis
of prison pharmacy data suggested health benefits evidenced by a 9% reduction
in the rate of dispensing medication for smoking-related illnesses (<xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">Tweed <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Health
economic analyses demonstrated cost-effectiveness of the Scottish smoke-free prison
policy over the short- and long-term, but uncertainty remained in the long-term
modelling due to the paucity of evidence internationally about smoking following
release from smoke-free prisons (<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">McMeekin
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p>A systematic review of prison-based smoking cessation interventions concluded that
&#8220;prisoners who experience a complete smoking ban typically resume smoking
shortly after release&#8221; suggesting that, on their own, smoke-free policies are
insufficient to maintain smoking abstinence after release (<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">de Andrade and Kinner, 2017</xref>). Another systematic review
identified 15 studies published to July 2017 with data on pre-release intentions
around smoking, smoking relapse or abstinence post-release or quit attempts
following post-release smoking relapse and noted that the evidence base was
&#8220;small, almost exclusively US-based&#8221; and &#8220;methodologically
weak&#8221; (<xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan,
2019</xref>). Their review highlighted &#8220;that more than 60% of
participants relapsed to smoking following release from smokefree prisons&#8221;
(p. 1015). Both of these reviews were conducted before e-cigarette use was permitted
in smoke-free prisons in the UK, and neither considered whether the use of
e-cigarettes in a smoke-free prison affects intention to or return to smoking rates
post-release.</p><p><xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">Spaulding <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2018)</xref>
have estimated that in-prison policy programmes could potentially result in 2
million fewer &#8220;smokers&#8221; resettling in communities globally. However,
high rates of relapse to smoking suggest that opportunities to improve the health of
people who have been incarcerated in smoke-free prisons are being missed,
particularly where the use of e-cigarettes is not permitted and the period of
imprisonment extends beyond two to three months. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal
peak in the first week of abstinence, with some studies suggesting they return to
baseline levels by two to four weeks, and others that they persist for several
months (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Hatsukami <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2008</xref>). The health of people released from prison is complex due to
co-occurring physical (<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">Ismail <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) and mental health conditions (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Fazel and Seewald, 2018</xref>), entrenched and
intergenerational social disadvantage (<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">Enggist
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and persistent inequalities in the use
and effects of tobacco smoking (<xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">Hiscock
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). For example, recent Australian
research reports that despite very high levels of mental illness and complex
multimorbidity, continuity of care post-release is inadequate (<xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Calais-Ferreira <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) and people
released from prison with mental health and substance use issues have a high risk of
morbidity, mortality and reincarceration (<xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">Thomas
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Borschmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>).</p><p>With recent evidence of high rates of relapse to smoking post-release, up to date
understanding of post-release smoking/vaping behaviour is necessary to increase
understanding of appropriate support strategies. This scoping review builds on and
expands earlier reviews (<xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and
Segan, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">de Andrade and Kinner,

smoking behaviours post-release and explicitly searching for relevant research on
e-cigarettes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The paper was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and

Andrade and Kinner, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan, 2019</xref>). We tested the search terms to
ensure they identified papers in the previous review. We searched Web of Science
Citation Indices, PsycInfo (EBSCOHost), Criminal Justice Abstracts (EBSCOHost)
and Medline (Ovid) databases, and the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE),
on 6 April 2022; the search was updated on 5 March 2024. The database search was
limited to English language records, and included journal articles,
dissertations and grey literature, such as third-sector reports and government
documents. To identify further relevant studies, we used backward snowballing
and forward plus emailed autoalerts of new records from the academic
databases.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Our examination of studies included vaping because some jurisdictions (e.g.

of nicotine addiction in prison and after release (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). The other also
mainly focused on the implementation of smoke-free policy in prisons but
included some data on which factors were perceived to hinder or facilitate
remaining smoke-free on release from interviews with prison staff and 18 men and
five women in custody (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic toggle="yes">et

We found no studies reporting on intention to vape post-release (as a way to remain
smoke-free) or on prevalence of vaping post-release. Hence, there is currently no
evidence internationally on whether, or how, vaping while in a smoke-free prison or
following release affects intentions to remain smoke-free, or rates of relapse to
smoking, after release from smoke-free prisons.</p><p>Similarly, none of the studies reported on quit attempts following return to smoking
after leaving a smoke-free prison.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Pre-release intentions to smoke or remain abstinent following release from a

who expressed pre-release intentions/expectations to smoke/remain abstinent
varied across studies, with four studies reporting that at least one in three
participants expected, intended or hoped to remain smoke-free. Only two studies,
with different designs, recorded pre-release intentions to remain abstinent
after release prospectively, while participants were still in prison. The first,
a survey conducted across a release preparation program in the USA within 20
weeks of release, reported 33% of respondents, in the 2020 survey wave,
selected &#8220;definitely not&#8221; when asked whether they expected to
resume smoking on release (<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">Ives <italic toggle="yes">et

interview intervention conducted with 557 participants within four to six weeks
of release from an Australian prison reported that at baseline 51% of
participants who were allocated to the intervention group &#8220;hoped to
remain smokefree after release&#8221; compared to 43% of the control
group (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,

the trial was that potential participants &#8220;express an interest in
remaining abstinent after release &#8230;&#8221; (p. 464).</p><p>Four studies measured pre-release intentions to smoke/remain abstinent
retrospectively. One, a cross-sectional survey of 114 participants released from
smoke-free prisons in Queensland, Australia (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), reported that
66% of participants expressed an intention to remain smoke-free. In a
qualitative study, which subsampled from participants in this survey who had
relapsed to smoking, 12 of the 21 participants were reported to have expressed a
&#8220;pre-release intention to remain abstinent after release&#8221; (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,

2021</xref>). Timepoints at which smoking prevalence data were collected, and
outcome measures varied across the studies, preventing detailed comparisons
being made across studies. All studies found that at least &#8764;65%
returned to smoking. Among 424 participants followed up (for an average of
&#8764;145 days) in an Australian RCT of a motivational interviewing
intervention, most participants had returned to smoking according to several
measures (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2021</xref>). Continuous smoking absence was self-reported by 16%
(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) in the intervention group and 12%
(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 27) of the control group and seven-day point
prevalence for self-reported abstinence was 31% in both groups. Rates of
abstinence were lower for the primary outcome (continuous absence [not having
smoked more than five cigarettes during follow-up period] confirmed by exhaled
carbon monoxide); after multiple imputations to account for missing data,
continuous abstinence was estimated to be 9% in the intervention group
and 7% in the control group. Cumulative self-reported relapse at three
months was 87% for the intervention group and 92% for the control
group; whereas 62% and 74%, respectively, reported relapse on the
day of release. The median number of cigarettes smoked daily was five and six,
respectively (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,

self-identifying &#8220;smokers&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 114)
released from prison in Queensland relapsed to smoking within 24 hours and
94% within two months of release (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) (although 62%
of those who relapsed to smoking post release reported smoking fewer cigarettes
post-release than pre-incarceration), whereas a third Australian study reported
that 86% of people re-entering prison after being in a smoke-free prison
in the past 12 months were daily &#8220;smokers&#8221; (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Albany <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Of the 190 participants from the WISE study in the USA, 50% relapsed to

biologically verified seven-day point prevalence abstinence (primary outcome) in

cessation counselling in jail plus a supply of NRT on release, compared to

(&#8220;any drug use&#8221; in the past four weeks (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Albany <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>),
&#8220;injectable drug use since release&#8221; (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) as
predictors for daily smoking; sex (women at higher risk of smoking in first
hour, day and week of release) (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) and planning to smoke following
release (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2022</xref>). A nine-year survey of people in prison identified factors
related to individual beliefs and expectations about smoking that may hinder
abstinence; these included no longer viewing themselves as addicted to nicotine
and believing it would be &#8220;fairly easy&#8221; not to return to smoking
post-release (<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">Ives <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2022</xref>). Another study (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) that examined the antecedents of
return to smoking post-release identified several circumstances commonly
associated with smoking after someone leaves prison: being with other people who
smoke or with friends and family; being given tobacco by someone else; feeling
positive emotions (e.g., being happy or excited); and using drugs or
alcohol.</p><p>A qualitative study conducted in Australia identified pre-release intention,
normalisation of smoking in home or social environments, perception of smoking
as a symbolic act of freedom or resistance or as providing a means to relieve
stress associated with resettlement or coping with craving for illicit
substances, as barriers to continued abstinence after leaving a smoke-free
prison (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Some similar factors were also cited in two
qualitative studies that explored <italic toggle="yes">anticipated</italic> barriers to
remaining smoke-free post-release (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Brown
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). In addition, staff associated
with the implementation of smoke-free prisons in England felt that an additional
potential reason for smoking relapse post-release was high levels of nicotine
use in the prison population due to vaping (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Staff described the high
prevalence of return to smoking when people moved from smoke-free closed prisons
to the open estate (that were not smoke-free) (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). They suggested
that the stress of moving between closed and open prison conditions, the
provision of a &#8220;smoking pack&#8221; and the fact that people were once
again surrounded by people smoking, made it more difficult for people to remain
smoke-free. Jayes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> noted that around 30% of people
in the open prison context were using e-cigarettes, but &#8220;most of
these&#8221; were dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes.</p><p>The most cited facilitators mentioned by 72 survey participants (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>)
who managed to remain smoking abstinent post-release were: not having cravings
to smoke, being with family, lack of finances, engaging in alternative
activities, having willpower and thinking about the health benefits of not
returning to smoking. Living with a partner, expressing support for smoke-free
prison policy, pre-release intention to remain abstinent and future intention to
quit smoking were associated with reduced daily smoking in another survey (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2018</xref>). Participants in the Australian qualitative study of 21 people
who had managed to remain abstinent for a time post-release (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2019</xref>) mentioned awareness of health and financial benefits of not
smoking, diversionary activities, social support from family and peers and
intrinsic motivation. People in prison in Scotland thought the experience of
health and financial benefits of not smoking while in prison may increase
motivations to give up in the longer term, and that use of smoking alternatives
during the transition period may help some people to avoid relapse (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2022</xref>).</p><p>One study (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,

intervention delivered prior to release may potentially delay relapse to smoking
post-release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>This scoping review builds on the systematic review by <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan (2019)</xref> of studies reporting on
factors influencing smoking following release from smoke-free prisons. Their review
identified 15 eligible studies and concluded that &#8220;the evidence base in this
area is small [&#8230;] [and] mostly methodologically weak&#8221; (p. 1011) and
dominated by studies from the USA. Our review (of studies published from 2017 to
March 2024) demonstrates that the evidence base remains &#8220;sparse&#8221; and
identified only an additional nine studies, of varying methodological design and
quality. Most were conducted in the USA or Australia. A systematic review (of
studies published from January 2000 to February 2022), which examined the impact of
smoking &#8220;bans&#8221; and other smoking cessation interventions in smoke-free
prisons, mental health and substance use treatment settings, similarly reported a
dearth of evidence on post-release/post-discharge smoking behaviours (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Sourry <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with existing evidence, our review found that most people return to
smoking after leaving a smoke-free prison, despite many people hoping or intending
to remain smoke-free. This is a missed opportunity to improve the health of a
priority group and to reduce health inequalities.</p><p>None of the new interventions (first published after 2017) reported in the studies
included in this review have been successful in preventing high rates of relapse to
smoking, often within 24 h, following release from a smoke-free prison. To our
knowledge, the WISE intervention remains the only intervention, which has shown
effectiveness in increasing smoking abstinence post-release (<xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">Clarke <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, one
study in our review reports that a single session of motivational interviewing
delivered pre-release (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) may have the potential to delay return to
smoking. This finding could be exploited in the future through the inclusion of
greater support, including in the post-release period, which may help to maintain
smoking abstinence for a longer period of time and/or facilitate further quit
attempts in the event of a smoking lapse. Our review also found evidence that
smoking levels may reduce following time spent in a smoke-free prison (<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2018</xref>), and following participation in a pre-release motivational
interviewing intervention (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) or a pre&#8211;post intervention combining
behavioural support and NRT (<xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Winkelman <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). As noted elsewhere (<xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Winkelman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), the significance
of results suggesting that some interventions may potentially reduce the amount
smoked post-release is less clear given uncertainties about the implications for
health and long-term smoking abstinence (<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">Chang
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">Lindson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Taken together, evidence from
this review and from previous reviews by <xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan (2019)</xref> and <xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Sourry <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2022)</xref> highlight the potential of
multi-component interventions that are delivered both before and after release to
change smoking behaviour.</p><p><xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan (2019)</xref> noted the
need for evidence on the potential for NRT to help reduce return to smoking
post-release. We identified one intervention study in which participants received a
supply of nicotine lozenges upon release from prison in combination with behaviour
support. Although the intervention did not increase smoking abstinence, participants
were positive about the behavioural support provided and suggested that the
provision of NRT could be expanded to in prison use, particularly in the lead up to
release. Given that a systematic review of effective behaviour change techniques for
preventing relapse following a stay in a smoke-free setting identified
pharmacological support as effective in reducing return to smoking (<xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">Shoesmith <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>),
further research on the use of NRT during and following time spent in a smoke-free
prison would be beneficial. Specifically, it would be helpful to understand more
about the optimum timing of providing NRT, the most feasible and acceptable
mechanisms for giving people access to NRT and how to maximise uptake and
adherence.</p><p>Crucially, our review demonstrated a complete lack of evidence worldwide on rates of
relapse to tobacco use following release from smoke-free prisons where the sale and
use of e-cigarettes has been allowed (as has been the case in England and Wales and
in Scotland over the past five years, and in some prisons in the USA). Although
evidence shows that e-cigarettes can help people to cope with smoke-free rules while
living in prison (<xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">O'Donnell <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), research is required to understand whether and
for whom vaping is a risk or protective factor for smoking relapse after leaving a
smoke-free setting. To date, evidence from the general population is mixed. For
example, a representative sample of USA recent former &#8220;smokers&#8221; did
not find an association between daily vaping and remaining abstinent. However, it
was found that those using e-cigarettes appeared more likely to quit again following
a relapse and to be abstinent for three months at follow-up (<xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">Pierce <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given that vaping is not risk-free (<xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Glantz
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">McNeill <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), it will be important to also
assess levels and patterns of dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes among prison
leavers and to tailor support to try to encourage complete tobacco cessation in this
group.</p><p>This review demonstrates that more research is needed on the most feasible and
effective means to support people leaving smoke-free prisons to remain smoke-free.
It strengthens understanding of factors potentially facilitating or hindering
smoking abstinence post-release and which may help optimise support with smoking
behaviour among people leaving smoke-free prisons. Firstly, strengthening intentions
and plans to remain smoke-free post-release should continue to be an important goal
for interventions (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263;
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Secondly, interventions
could target incomplete understandings that people in prison may have about the
nature of smoking addiction and about the (very high) risks of returning to smoking
post-release (<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">Ives <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2022</xref>). Thirdly, interventions could support people to prepare coping
strategies for when they are likely to be faced with smoking triggers almost
immediately after leaving prison (e.g. feeling buoyant about release, returning to
the company of people who smoke and being offered tobacco) (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Developing coping
strategies for ongoing social and environmental smoking triggers associated with
resettlement from prison (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263;
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) is also likely to be beneficial and
could be addressed as part of providing wraparound services for people exiting
prison. Co-use of tobacco and alcohol/illicit drugs among people leaving prison
(<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Albany <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>;
<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>;
<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2019</xref>) continues to be an important risk factor for smoking behaviour
interventions. Interventions need to be cognisant of polysubstance use to improve
outcomes (<xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">McKelvey <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,
2017</xref>). Finally, family-based interventions could be developed given
continued evidence of the positive/negative influence which social networks have on
smoking behaviours (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Martin
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p>This review suggests several areas to potentially target to try to address very high
rates of smoking relapse following release from smoke-free prison. However, despite
there being clear public health benefits to people remaining smoke-free
post-release, there remains uncertainty about how best to intervene in this
population due to the limited evidence-base. Further research to better understand
what approaches are both feasible and effective for maintaining smoking abstinence
following release from prison is needed. This could include studies to support
tailoring of existing interventions for smoking cessation/abstinence to reflect the
complex needs of people in prison, the challenges they face as they return to the
community and to overcome constraints for delivering health promotion activities in
specific prison settings. Studies to help maximise the potential of novel
interventions that look promising would also be beneficial. Difficulties in
implementing and researching new health initiatives in prisons may help to explain
the current limited evidence available to help those seeking to maximise the health
gains of smoke-free prison and other similar settings (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Sourry <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Such difficulties
include competing priorities, considerable constraints on access and resources and
features of the setting or the population which can make randomisation and follow-up
post-release challenging and costly (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Sourry
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p>A strength of our review is that we searched databases that cover health, justice and
criminology. We have updated previous reviews at a time when further jurisdictions
(England, Wales and Scotland) have introduced smoke-free prison policies; it is
noteworthy that these UK jurisdictions elected to allow vaping in smoke-free
prisons. However, our review is limited by the sparse evidence base, which limits
our ability to draw firm conclusions. As in the earlier systematic review (<xref rid="ref040" ref-type="bibr">Puljevi&#263; and Segan, 2019</xref>), our
searches were restricted to studies published in English and the evidence base
remains dominated by studies from Australia and the USA. A notable finding is that
there is currently no evidence internationally on whether, or how, vaping whilst in
a smoke-free prison or following release affects intentions to remain smoke-free, or
rates of relapse to smoking, after release from smoke-free prisons.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All evidence to date shows that relapse rates post-release remain high, thus
diminishing the public health potential of smoke-free prison policy and limiting the
extent to which such policies may help to reduce health inequalities attributable to
smoking. This highlights a significant need to continue to try to develop the
evidence base to support stakeholders to better equip those leaving prison with the
skills, motivation and support to remain smoke-free post-release.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study is funded by the NIHR [PHR Project: NIHR 131613]. ED further acknowledges
