Sphingolipid metabolism, which governs a number of cellular processes, has been recognised as a player involved in the control of immune heterogeneity within the TME. Sphingolipid metabolism&#8208;related genes prevalent in the TME of LUAD and LUSC were identified using transcriptomic analysis and clinical samples from the TCGA and GTEx databases. Lasso regression and survival SVM in the Etra Application were employed as machine learning algorithms to determine patient outcomes and to reveal key immune factors associated with gene expression and chemotherapeutic response. Gene expression in lung cancer cells was explored through scRNA&#8208;seq data. Thereafter, mediation impact analysis was further performed to explain the defined relation between the immune cell subsets and sphingolipid metabolites and their risk impact on lung cancers. Genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism were dysregulated in lung cancer, correlating with immune cell infiltration and TME remodelling. Lasso regression identified ASAH1 and SMPD1 as strong prognostic markers. scRNA&#8208;seq revealed higher gene expression in T cells, macrophages and fibroblasts. Sphingomyelin partially mediated the link between T lymphocyte abundance and lung cancer risk. High&#8208;risk phenotypes exhibited enhanced immune evasion via altered regulatory T cell and macrophage polarisation. This research highlights the contribution of sphingolipid metabolism in shaping the TME and its implications for immunotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0001">immune dynamics</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0002">immunotherapy</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0003">lung cancer</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0004">machine learning</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0005">sphingolipid metabolism</kwd><kwd id="jcmm70435-kwd-0006">tumour microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China

The complexity of these tumours and their resistance to traditional treatments result in poor patient prognosis, prompting researchers to seek new therapeutic strategies and biomarkers. In recent years, the rise of immunotherapy has brought new hope to lung cancer treatment, with immune dynamics in the tumour microenvironment becoming a research hotspot [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The sphingolipid metabolic pathway plays multiple roles in cell biology, including cell signalling, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. In oncology, the abnormal activation of sphingolipid metabolism is closely associated with tumour initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis. Particularly in immune regulation, sphingolipid metabolic products have been shown to influence the functions of immune cells, including T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby promoting tumour immune evasion. For example, certain sphingolipids, such as sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P), can regulate the migration and function of immune cells within the tumour microenvironment, impacting tumour immune surveillance. Additionally, key enzymes in sphingolipid metabolism, such as sphingosine kinases (SphKs) and ceramidases, play critical roles in tumour cell survival and proliferation. These findings highlight the significant role of sphingolipid metabolism in cancer biology, providing potential targets and biomarkers for the development of novel anti&#8208;tumour therapeutic strategies [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>This study employs machine learning techniques combined with large&#8208;scale genomic and transcriptomic data and mediated mendelian randomization to deeply analyse the expression patterns of sphingolipid metabolism&#8208;related genes in lung cancer and explore their impact on immune dynamics within the tumour microenvironment. By comparing the expression differences of sphingolipid metabolism genes in lung cancer tissues versus normal tissues, we aim to uncover their potential roles in lung cancer progression and assess their potential as prognostic biomarkers [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer research, offering innovative approaches to analyse complex biological data. Techniques such as survival SVM, CoxBoost and Lasso regression allow for the integration and analysis of vast datasets, identifying patterns and relationships that may not be apparent through traditional methods [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, machine learning models are applied to predict patient prognosis based on gene expression and clinical features and to explore the relationship between gene expression and drug sensitivity. These models can provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalised treatment strategies.</p><p>Furthermore, this study will explore the association between sphingolipid metabolism gene expression and clinical characteristics of lung cancer patients, including pathological stage, gender, age and specific gene expression levels, with the goal of discovering new predictive models for assessing patient prognosis and treatment response. Through these analyses, we hope to provide new perspectives for the precision treatment of lung cancer, particularly in the era of immunotherapy, offering patients more personalised treatment options. With the continuous advancement of immunotherapy and the integration of machine learning, these findings are expected to bring more effective and precise treatment options to lung cancer patients, improving their quality of life and survival outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="jcmm70435-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="jcmm70435-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Data Sources of Exposures and Outcomes</title><p>The GWAS summary statistics for each immunological feature can be obtained from the GWAS Catalogue (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/</ext-link>), with accession numbers ranging from GCST90001391 to GCST90002121. The analysis included a total of 731immunophenotypes.

Cochran's <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> test was used to evaluate heterogeneity among summary estimates. In addition, we employed the MR&#8208;Egger intercept to specifically handle and consider pleiotropy.

The MR&#8208;PRESSO test was utilised to detect and resolve pleiotropy, as well as exclude any data points that deviate significantly from the norm. Furthermore, we employed a two&#8208;step MR analysis to identify mediator variables of metabolites that mediate the causal connection between immune cells and lung cancer. The two&#8208;step MR analysis employed the equation &#946;&#8722;&#946;1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;&#946;2 to quantify the direct effect of exposure on the outcome.

During the data preprocessing stage, we implemented a series of detailed steps to ensure the quality and accuracy of RNA data. First, we validated RNA counts to ensure they met industry standards, including checking gene expression counts for each cell to ensure they were within a reasonable range. Next, we performed strict quality control on the cell data to remove low&#8208;quality cells. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of mitochondrial gene expression in each cell and set a threshold (usually less than 10%) to remove cells with high mitochondrial gene expression, which could indicate cell damage or death. Additionally, we set thresholds for the number of genes detected and UMI counts, such as requiring each cell to have more than 250 detected genes and more than 500 UMI counts, to exclude cells with sparse gene expression or unstable data. Forms part&#8208;preprocessing and PCA (principal component analysis) to characterise self&#8208;similarity patterns within cell types or states. We then made PCA scatter plots showing a distribution of tumour samples corresponding to top principal components. This is followed by the use of t&#8208;SNE (t&#8208;distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to cluster cells, separate cell populations and endpoint plots for clustering to show variety in cell type or some potential subtypes.

The following is a detailed discussion of the findings, highlighting the roles of machine learning and immune infiltration in lung cancer.</p><p>Machine learning, as an advanced data analysis tool, is increasingly applied in biomedical research. In lung cancer studies, machine learning models have been used to identify biomarkers, predict prognosis, classify tumour subtypes and develop personalised treatment plans. In this study, we employed various machine learning models, including survival SVM, CoxBoost and Lasso regression, to analyse survival data and gene expression data of lung cancer patients [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One of the main advantages of survival SVM is its ability to effectively handle right&#8208;censored data, which is crucial for survival analysis. Additionally, it performs well in dealing with high&#8208;dimensional data, making it suitable for situations where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples. Survival SVM also offers a variety of kernel function options, such as linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, allowing it to adapt to different data characteristics and requirements. However, the model also has some drawbacks. For instance, it has a high computational complexity, especially when dealing with large&#8208;scale datasets, which can result in longer training times. Moreover, the model's performance is highly sensitive to the choice of kernel functions and parameter settings, requiring meticulous tuning, such as selecting appropriate values for the penalty coefficient <italic toggle="yes">C</italic> and the RBF kernel's &#947;.</p><p>These models not only enhanced the accuracy of lung cancer prognosis predictions but also helped identify key genes closely related to prognosis. Specifically, the Lasso regression model reduced model complexity through regularisation, improving prediction stability and accuracy. This finding demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively handle complex biomedical data, providing new strategies for precision medicine in lung cancer. Additionally, the predictive power of machine learning models can be further enhanced by integrating multi&#8208;source data, as demonstrated in this study through the integration of TCGA and GTEx database data.</p><p>Immune infiltration is a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, influencing tumour growth, metastasis and response to treatment. In lung cancer, the composition and state of immune cells are closely related to tumour progression and prognosis [<xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm70435-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results indicate that the expression of sphingolipid metabolism&#8208;related genes is closely linked to the level of immune cell infiltration in lung cancer. Specifically, we found that certain sphingolipid metabolism genes are positively correlated with specific immune cell subsets, such as Th17 cells, eosinophils and mast cells, while negatively correlated with Th2 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). These results reveal the potential role of sphingolipid metabolism in regulating the tumour immune microenvironment, possibly by influencing the function and distribution of immune cells to promote or inhibit tumour development.</p><p>Our study also explored the role of sphingolipid metabolism in immune evasion in lung cancer. By analysing differences in immune cell infiltration between high&#8208;risk and low&#8208;risk lung cancer patients, we found that immune evasion and dysfunction were more pronounced in the high&#8208;risk group. This may be due to sphingolipid metabolism products regulating immune cell activity, thus affecting the tumour's resistance to immune attack. These findings provide a theoretical basis for developing immunotherapy strategies targeting sphingolipid metabolism. Additionally, our study found that the expression of sphingolipid metabolism genes is related to tumour TNM stage and sample origin, further emphasising their important role in lung cancer progression.</p><p>Key enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, such as sphingosine kinases (SphKs) and ceramidases, play critical roles in tumour cell survival and proliferation. Specific small&#8208;molecule inhibitors or antibodies targeting the activity of these enzymes can be developed to block the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, thereby inhibiting tumour cell growth and spread. For example, SphK1 inhibitors have been shown to suppress tumour cell proliferation and migration while enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs. There is a close regulatory relationship between sphingolipid metabolism and lipid metabolism. For example, certain enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, such as ceramidase, can convert ceramide into sphingosine, which can then be further converted into sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P). These metabolites play important roles in lipid metabolism. Studying the interactions between these metabolic pathways can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic balance of lipids within cells and their roles in diseases.</p><p>Our findings have potential implications for lung cancer treatment strategies. By identifying sphingolipid metabolism genes closely related to prognosis, we can offer more personalised treatment plans for patients. Furthermore, by analysing the relationship between gene expression and drug sensitivity, we may be able to predict patient responses to specific drugs, achieving precision medicine. These findings highlight the importance of considering the immune microenvironment and metabolic pathways in lung cancer treatment. Future treatment strategies may include targeted therapies against these key metabolic pathways, as well as methods to enhance immunotherapy effects by modulating the immune microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="jcmm70435-sec-0027"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The performance of machine learning models heavily depends on the quality and quantity of training data. Although we integrated data from the TCGA and GTEx databases, these datasets may have limitations, such as insufficient sample sizes and a lack of diversity. If the training data do not comprehensively cover the various types and clinical features of lung cancer, the model's generalisation ability in real&#8208;world applications might be limited, leading to decreased prediction accuracy for new data. Additionally, some machine learning models, like survival SVM and CoxBoost, exhibit a certain black&#8208;box nature, making their internal decision processes difficult to interpret intuitively. This makes it challenging to understand how the model predicts lung cancer prognosis based on sphingolipid metabolism gene expression data and immune cell infiltration characteristics. It limits the model's credibility and transparency and affects clinicians' ability to understand and apply the model's predictions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="jcmm70435-sec-0028"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study utilised machine learning techniques to uncover the role of sphingolipid metabolism in lung cancer, particularly its impact on immune infiltration.
