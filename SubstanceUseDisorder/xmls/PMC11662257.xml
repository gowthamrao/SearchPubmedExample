Between 2014 and 2019, an additional 7 states granted this independence.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Alongside these legislative changes, the share of all health care visits provided by NPs increased from 8.9% in 2013 to 17.3% in 2019.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Proponents argued that practice independence for NPs would expand access to care and reduce costs, because NP services are typically billed at lower rates than physician services.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, there was concern by opponents that an expanded scope of NP practice might lead to more dangerous opioid prescribing, worsening the nationwide epidemic. In 2020, the American Medical Association opposed the proposed expansion of scope of practice for NPs in California, arguing that the legislation would not increase access to care or reduce costs and would lead to overprescribing, especially of opioids.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Studies of practice independence legislation across states have found mixed associations with opioid prescribing. In a cross-sectional study comparing NPs in states with practice independence with those with more restrictive practice environments, NPs were more than 20 times more likely to exhibit risky opioid prescribing practices.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Another cross-sectional examination of Medicare Part D claims found that NPs and physicians in states with a full NP scope of practice prescribed more oxycodone and hydrocodone compared with states with restricted NP practice rules.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These cross-sectional studies did not analyze states before and after the legislation and thus could not account for higher base rates of opioid prescribing in some states. McMichael et al<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> used a difference-in-differences approach and found that opioid prescribing by NPs and physicians to patients with commercial insurance declined after the adoption of NP scope of practice laws. Another study that used a difference-in-differences approach found that expanded scope of NP practice was associated with increased access to mental health services among the Medicaid population but did not change opioid prescribing in general.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>In addition, past research has used measures of opioid prescribing that could not distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate prescribing. Because opioids can serve legitimate medical purposes, our study focused on high-risk opioid prescribing. Previous studies typically did not account for substitution across clinician types, nor NPs billing under physician provider numbers, which is why we aggregated measures of prescribing. Additionally, previous studies used yearly data, which are coarse considering that legislation can go into effect throughout the year. We used monthly prescribing data, which allowed for more precise comparisons around the exact date that NPs gained independence. Lastly, our study compared states not only with themselves in the past, but with similar, neighboring states to eliminate state-specific factors and regional trends that were associated with opioid prescribing.</p><p>We investigated the associations of scope of practice legislation with opioid prescribing to commercially insured adults aged 18 to 64 years by all types of clinicians. We did not evaluate whether NPs prescribed opioids in ways that differ from physicians, but rather we measured aggregate changes following independence legislation.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-AOI240078"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-AOI240078"><title>Data</title><p>We used prescription claims from Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) Axis, one of the largest datasets of commercial claims in the US for January 2012 through December 2021.<sup><xref rid="aoi240078r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240078r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240078r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Our analysis sample (described later) captured 2.9% of the civilian population aged 18 to 64 years in 2012, with variation across states (eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-AOI240078-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).

We then identified continuously enrolled members between ages 18 and 64 years who had primary medical and prescription drug coverage in every month during the sample window. This ensured that we could observe all claims for a balanced panel of members during the relevant period. We then identified opioid claims in the BCBS Axis pharmacy prescription table for these members. The eAppendix and eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-AOI240078-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> provide additional details for each of the 6 cohorts.</p><p>Finally, because the policy variation occurred at the level of state and month, we collapsed the data to the state-month level for estimation. For each month and state, we summed prescription counts by prescription types, we summed days of overlap for risky prescription combinations and calculated the prescription-weighted average MME and days supplied. The state-month data for the policy cohorts were stacked in event time (ie, compared with the treatment month for the cohort) and analyzed using Stata/SE software, releases 16 and 18 (StataCorp).</p></sec><sec id="H2-6-AOI240078"><title>Robustness</title><p>To assess the robustness of our findings, we tested alternative specifications by varying our choices of control variables, patient samples, control states, and geographic levels of analysis. We tested a specification that controlled for state-level economic conditions, the number of physicians per population, and the number of NPs per population, as well as versions without certain sample restrictions. We separately analyzed prescribing rates for patients who, during the 2 years before the legislation change, either had an office visit with an NP or only saw physicians. Instead of using neighboring states as controls, we also used distance cutoffs based on centers of population and geography to include or exclude control states, as well as using all available control groups. We tested a version on the county level, rather than state level, for which we restricted to counties on the borders of states. In this case, aggregation was conducted at the county-month rather than state-month level. Lastly, we included controls for the presence of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program legislation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-AOI240078"><title>Results</title><sec id="H2-7-AOI240078"><title>Balance on Characteristics</title><p>States that granted NPs practice and prescribing independence between 2014 and 2019 had similar characteristics 2 years before the legislation was passed as states that acted as controls, as shown in <xref rid="aoi240078t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

We used one of the largest available datasets of commercial insurance claims to analyze associations across the US over a 10-year period. Unlike previous studies of Medicare Part D claims, our analysis included middle-aged individuals, an important group who have been especially affected by the opioid epidemic. One advantage of our methods was that we created measures of opioid prescribing by aggregating claims data from a fixed, continuously enrolled sample of individuals. Accordingly, all comparisons were made between the same individuals living in the same location across years, ensuring our results were not driven by entry into or exit from the sample, or movement of patients across states. Moreover, we observed individuals even if they were not prescribed any opioids, and we determined if individuals were opioid naive (ie, they had not received an opioid during the previous 6 months).</p><p>We found that state legislation granting independence to NPs was not associated with changes in rates of high-risk opioid prescribing in the state. This finding was consistent across several measures, including concurrent opioid and CNS depressant prescribing and high-risk prescribing to opioid-naive patients.</p><p>One potential explanation for our precisely estimated, null findings is that NP independence may have reduced the administrative burden of complying with supervision and collaboration requirements but otherwise did not meaningfully change the day-to-day activities of NPs. NPs may have continued to consult with or refer patients to physicians to ensure appropriate opioid prescribing. If this was the case, reduced administrative burdens may have enhanced efficiency for clinicians and reduced health care costs. However, the study results imply that oversight requirements were not associated with reductions in risky opioid prescribing. When requirements were removed, there was no change in risky prescribing. Physicians themselves may not have been careful in their oversight duties, or they may have reduced their own risky prescribing to offset increases in risky prescribing by NPs following the legislation change.</p><p>Favorable financial reimbursement for NPs when billing under physician codes may have also encouraged continued collaboration even when not required by law. Although some recent evidence suggests that, cross-sectionally, NPs prescribed high-risk opioids at higher rates than physicians, we showed that relaxing physician supervision requirements on NPs was not associated with changes in high-risk opioid prescribing on net.</p><sec id="H2-10-AOI240078"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had limitations. First, legislation and practice patterns around opioid prescribing were changing throughout the 2010s, and so it is difficult to ascribe changes in rates of prescribing, or lack thereof, to any one type of legislation. However, the fact that we observed parallel trends in neighboring states and used variation around the month rather than year of the legislation change potentially assuages some of these concerns. Second, while the 6-year continuous enrollment requirement allowed us to produce a balanced panel of commercially insured members who did not change in composition over time, it could have also introduced selection bias. Individuals adversely affected by changes in opioid prescribing practices may have been more likely to drop out of the sample. For instance, if an individual received high-risk opioids, developed a substance use disorder, and subsequently lost their employment and/or their employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, they would have been excluded from the sample. Third, there may have been legislative endogeneity, in which states that anticipate changes in prescribing adjust the legislative environment in response. Fourth, there may have been spillovers across states (eg, if prescribers move to regions based on legislation). That said, the restrictions on member location allowed us to rule out patients who moved across state lines. Fifth, in terms of external validity, the study samples were limited to members who had health insurance coverage through BCBS plans, but there may have been changes in prescribing among other groups that we did not observe. Lastly, we investigated changes in prescribing up to 2 years after a change in legislation. The existing pool of NPs would have had experience working collaboratively or under the supervision of a physician. Newer cohorts of NPs would not have had this experience but would make up a growing portion of the workforce. Any effects of the change in legislation might appear more than 24 months later.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI240078"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This difference-in-difference analysis found that, following states granting independence to nurse practitioners, increases in high-risk opioid prescribing were not observed. Opioid prescribing is likely not a key factor in the safety of this type of legislation, as previously implemented by states. Future research may examine nuance in state policies around NPs (eg, those that did not extend NP independence to opioid prescribing).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI240078"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi240078r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group>.
