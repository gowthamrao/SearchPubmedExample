Cellular retinol binding protein-1 (CRBP-1) as a carrier protein transports retinol from the liver storage site to peripheral tissue. Up-regulated expression of CRBP-1 is associated with some tumor types such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer as reported, but its role in TSCC remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, an integrated bioinformatics analysis based on the multiple cancer microarray data sets available from Oncomine database was conducted to view the differential expression of CRBP-1 between TSCC and the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were performed to investigate CRBP-1 expression in 101 paraffin-embeded TSCC tissues and 48 pairs of freshly frozen tissues. Kaplan-Meier curve and univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis were used to estimate the association between CRBP-1 expression and patients&#8217; prognosis. Then western blotting, MTT, transwell migration and invasion assays were performed in TSCC cell lines to investigate the effects of CRBP-1 on cellular proliferation and invasion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Compared with the matched adjacent non-tumorous tissues, the expression of CRBP-1 was significantly up-regulated in TSCC tissues, which correlated with the differentiation state (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003), N classification (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.048), the clinical stage (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.048) and death (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001).

The biological effects of retinol are primarily mediated by all trans-retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and 9-cis retinoic acid receptors (RXRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Currently, researchers have focused much attention on the roles of retinoic acid binding proteins and cellular retinol binding proteins (CRABPs and CRBPs) in carcinogenesis. Retinoid intracellular transportation and retinoid-induced cellular activities in physiology are under regulation of CRABPs and CRBPs. Among them,CRBP-1 takes an important part in the uptake and subsequent esterification of retinol and improving bioavailability and transcriptional activities. In addition, CRBP-1 plays a vital role in the embryonic development, growth, vision and survival of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Recent studies found that CRBP-1 was down-regulated in certain human cancer tissues, including prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and that CRBP-1 was up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and laryngeal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, few studies focused on the clinicopathological features of CRBP-1 expression levels in human TSCC. Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine whether CRBP-1 influenced tumor progression and overall survival (OS) rates in TSCC patients. To find out the relationship between CRBP-1 and TSCC, qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted to examine CRBP-1 expression in a batch of human TSCC tissues and the matched non-tumorous tissues.

The mRNA and protein levels of CRBP-1 increased in tumorous tissues compared to those in the matched non-tumorous tissues. Because of individual difference, the expression of CRBP-1 in TSCC tissues and the matched adjacent normal tissues was different. Some tumor tissues with low expression were almost equal to the normal tissues with high expression. But CRBP-1 was significantly overexpressed in TSCC tissues than the adjacent normal tissues compared by the Student&#8217;s t-test (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05).

Specifically, retinol can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cell. High expression levels of CRBP-1 in TSCC were correlated with increased CRBP- 1 gene copy numbers and were also parallel to increased tumor grades, suggesting that high expression levels of CRBP-1 reflects a more aggressive and dedifferentiated phenotype of squamous cell carcinoma. These results are consistent with Elena et al.&#8217;s study. They found that 62.3% of adenocarcinomas expressed high level of CRBP-1 which associated with increased tumor grade and reduced OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">We wondered whether CRBP-1 made a great contribution to tumor proliferation and metastasis. To find out the answer, MTT and transwell assay were conducted in CAL-27 and SCC-25 cell lines with CRBP-1 knocked down. The result revealed that the proliferation and invasion of CRBP-1-knockdown cells was significantly inhibited. A recent study got the similar result in which they found significant inhibition of proliferation of A549 cells transfected with CRBP-1comparing to the control group.</p><p id="Par41">We ascertained that CRBP-1 was distinctly upregulated in TSCC tissues and CRBP-1 upregulation was closely contected with reduced survival of TSCC patients. Besides, CRBP-1 expression of TSCC patients was in relation to tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that knocking down CRBP-1 inhibit the proliferation and invasion of CAL-27 and SCC-25 cell lines. However, further research is necessary to help us clarify the molecular mechanism of CRBP-1 in TSCC. To summarize, our results declare that CRBP-1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker of TSCC and a potential therapeutic target for TSCC treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">In this study, we found that CRBP-1 expression levels increased in patients with TSCC, and high expression levels of CRBP-1 indicated a poor prognosis. Knockdown of CRBP-1 weaken the proliferation and invasion ability of TSCC cells. Our results suggest that CRBP-1 may be a promising prognostic biomarker of TSCC patients and therapeutic target for TSCC treatment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AJCC</term><def><p id="Par5">American Joint Committee on Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRBP-1</term><def><p id="Par6">Cellular retinol binding protein-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HNSCC</term><def><p id="Par7">Head and neck squamous carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p id="Par8">Overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OSCC</term><def><p id="Par9">Oral squamous cell carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qRT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par10">Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par11">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSCC</term><def><p id="Par12">Tongue squamous cell carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par13">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par43">This study was financed by the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (05010201), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81602137) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (17ykzd31).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par44">The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#8217; contributions</title><p>YC, MM, and TT carried out experiments, analyzed the data, and participated in the experiment design and manuscript writing.
