Chemotherapy, a mainstay modality for NSCLC, has demonstrated restricted effectiveness due to the emergence of chemo-resistance and systemic side effects. Studies have indicated that combining chemotherapy with phototherapy, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), can enhance efficacy of therapy. In this work, an aminated mesoporous graphene oxide (rPGO)-protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)-hyaluronic acid (HA)@Osimertinib (AZD) nanodrug delivery system (rPPH@AZD) was successfully developed for combined chemotherapy/phototherapy for NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pH/hyaluronidase-responsive nanodrug delivery system (rPPH@AZD) was prepared using mesoporous graphene oxide. Its morphology, elemental composition, surface functional groups, optical properties, in vitro drug release ability, photothermal properties, reactive oxygen species production, cellular uptake and cell viability were evaluated. In addition, the in vivo therapeutic effect, biocompatibility, and imaging capabilities of rPPH@AZD were verified by a tumor-bearing mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Aminated mesoporous graphene oxide (rPGO) plays a role as a drug delivery vehicle owing to its large specific surface area and ease of surface functionalization. rPGO exhibits excellent photothermal conversion properties under laser irradiation, while PPIX acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen. AZD acts as a small molecule targeted drug in chemotherapy. In essence, rPPH@AZD shows excellent photothermal and fluorescence imaging effects in tumor-bearing mice. More importantly, in vitro and in vivo results indicate that rPPH@AZD can achieve hyaluronidase/pH dual response as well as combined chemotherapy/PTT/PDT anti-NSCLC treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The newly prepared rPPH@AZD can serve as a promising pH/hyaluronidase-responsive nanodrug delivery system that integrates photothermal/fluorescence imaging and chemo/photo combined therapy for efficient therapy against NSCLC.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="video"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

The payload of AZD may be attributed to the presence of rPP mesoporous pores, further illustrating that mesoporous graphene oxide has good drug loading and release properties which can load and deliver anticancer drugs effectively.</p><p>Currently, nano-drug delivery systems can respond to exogenous or endogenous stimuli such as pH, enzyme, light, and temperature, to achieve targeted drug release in tumor tissues and minimize negative effects on normal tissues.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) displays the AZD release from rPPH@AZD in PBS at pH 5.5 and 7.4 in the presence and absence of HAase. rPPH@AZD in the absence of HAase at pH 5.5 and 7.4 shows about 8% AZD release in the first 10 min and then stops the further release of AZD. However, in the presence of HAase, rPPH@AZD has more significant release of AZD with 55.5% at pH 5.5 and 20% at pH 7.4, indicating that the drug release of rPPH@AZD can be stimulated by HAase. The lower the pH, the higher the release of AZD from rPPH@AZD. Thus, the lower pH of the tumor tissue environment could serve as a stimulus to control drug release. In the physiological environment of tumors, the pH is lower than that of normal tissues. The &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking effect between AZD and rPPH is weakened in the acidic environment of tumor tissue, resulting in increased AZD diffusion movement. Since the TME is characterized by high enzyme concentration and low pH, rPPH@AZD as a hyaluronidase/pH-responsive nanodrug delivery systems can enhance drug penetration and accumulation at the tumor site.

(<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) shows the absorbances of DPBF, PBS and DPBF, rPGO and DPBF, and rPPH@AZD and DPBF. After 13 min of 660 nm laser irradiation, the change in absorbance at 425 nm is negligible for DPBF, and DPBF in PBS. By contrast, the absorbance at 425 nm for rPGO and DPBF decreases with time under 660 nm irradiation, demonstrating that rPGO could generate ROS. For rPPH@AZD and DPBF, the decrease in absorbance at 425 nm is more significant, inferring that rPPH@AZD possesses a stronger ROS generation capability under 660 nm light irradiation. In essence, rPPH@AZD multifunctional nanocarriers have excellent ROS generation ability, which is crucial for joint and synergistic treatment.</p><p>Since PGO has strong NIR absorption ability and excellent photothermal properties, it can be used as a photothermal agent to convert light energy and generate localized thermal energy to kill tumor cells. (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) displays the temperature changes of PBS, PGO, rPGO, and rPPH@AZD solutions under 808 nm laser irradiation (1.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). PBS shows little temperature change after 10 min. But the temperatures of PGO, rPGO, and rPPH@AZD increase from 26 to 40.5, 47.3, and 49.0&#176;C, respectively, demonstrating that rPGO and rPPH@AZD have good photothermal property. This is attributed to the fact that rPGO and rPPH@AZD possess graphene structure with its aromatic networks capable of absorbing NIR light. Photothermal stability is important for nanoparticles possessing photothermal therapeutic ability because continuous multiple laser irradiation is unavoidable during the experimental process. However, some photothermal materials will be gradually inactivated after multiple laser irradiations resulting in a gradual decrease of photothermal conversion efficiency and loss of photothermal therapeutic effect. Thus, the photothermal stability of rPPH@AZD was assessed by five cycles of heating and cooling as shown in (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). The thermal stability of rPPH@AZD under 808 nm light irradiation is good even after five consecutive cycles of heating and cooling. The calculated photothermal conversion efficiency of rPPH@AZD is 47.6%, indicating that rPPH@AZD has good photothermal stability and conversion efficiency. These results demonstrate that rPPH@AZD nanocomposite has good photothermal stability and can be used as a thermosensitive agent for photothermal therapy.</p><p>The therapeutic effect of rPPH@AZD on A549 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay.

In general, increasing the concentration of these nanomaterials will cause cell viability to decrease. The survival rates of cells treated with 50 &#956;g/mL rPPH for the PTT and PDT group are 59.3 and 55.9%, respectively. The cell viability of A549 cells incubated with 50 &#956;g/mL rPPH@AZD in the chemotherapy/PTT/PDT group is only 19%, revealing that the combination of chemotherapy, PTT and PDT could achieve excellent therapeutic effect on cancer cells.

(<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>) depicts the CLMS images of A549 cells subjected to PBS, 660 and 808 nm lasers irradiation, rPPH, rPPH@AZD (chemotherapy), rPPH with 808 nm irradiation (PTT), rPPH with 660 nm irradiation (PDT), and rPPH@AZD with 660 and 808 (chemotherapy/PTT/PDT). Cells with PBS, NIR irradiation and rPPH show almost no cell death, proving that tumor cells are hardly damaged when only illuminated without nanomedicine. Cells with PPH@AZD, rPPH with 808 nm, and rPPH with 660 nm show partial cell death, while almost all cells are died under rPPH@AZD with 660 and 808 nm irradiation. All these results suggest that the combined chemotherapy, PTT and PDT is a more effective way to induce apoptosis in A549 cells.</p><p>The ability of nanomaterials to generate ROS was determined by the DCFH-DA probe as shown in (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). The DCFH-FA probe reacts with ROS, resulting in the production of 2&#8217;,7&#8217;-dichlorofluorescein&#160;with green fluorescence. Cells subjected to PBS display no fluorescence. Cells treated with rPGO exhibit faint green emission, inferring that rPGO with 660 nm irradiation can generate only a small quantity of ROS. By contrast, cells treated with rPPH and rPPH@AZD and 660 nm irradiation exhibit strong green emissions, implying that both rPPH and rPPH@AZD possess ROS generation capability under laser irradiation. These ROS have strong oxidizing properties and can damage the cell membrane, mitochondria, and other structures of tumor cells, leading to cell death. At the same time, ROS can also destroy the signaling pathways of tumor cells and inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells.</p><p>Flow cytometry was applied to evaluate nanomaterial-induced apoptosis. (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) displays the apoptosis images of A549 cells subjected to PBS, 660 and 808 nm (NIR), rPPH, rPPH@AZD (chemotherapy), rPPH with 808 nm (PTT), rPPH with 660 nm (PDT), and rPPH with 660 and 808 nm (chemotherapy/PPT/PDT). The top right panel in (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) shows the apoptosis rates under PBS, NIR, rPPH, chemotherapy, PTT, PDT, and chemotherapy/PPT/PDT treatments. The apoptosis rates under chemotherapy, PTT group, and PDT treatments reach 28.7, 33.4, and 52%, respectively. Under the combined chemotherapy, PTT and PDT treatment, the apoptosis rate is as high as 72.1%, indicating that rPPH@AZD could induce apoptosis of A549 cells through the combined chemotherapy/PTT/PDT therapy with 660 and 808 nm lasers irradiation. (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>) shows the temperature images of mice with tumors which are real-time captured by an in vivo IR thermal camera. Mice were injected with PBS, rPPH, and rPPH@AZD via the tail veins, following exposure to an 808 nm laser for 10 min after 9 h. The color intensity from blue to red indicates the temperature from 20&#176;C to 50&#176;C. Mouse with PBS injection has only a slight increase in temperature. For the mice injected with rPPH and rPPH@AZD, their tumor center can reach 50&#176;C, confirming that both rPPH and rPPH@AZD could generate enough heat under laser irradiation to achieve better PTT efficacy. In other words, long term exposure of rPPH@AZD to NIR would not deteriorate its photothermal stability. The thermogenesis of photothermic agents can elevate the local temperature of tumor tissues, leading to enhanced blood flow and mitigation of tumor hypoxia to some extent. This in turn reduces drug resistance caused by anoxic environments and further enhances the synergistic therapeutic effect of composite nanosystems.

The fluorescence of rPPH@AZD in the tumor grows gradually from 0 to 9 h and subsequently decreases after 9 h. The fluorescence of the tumor site is strongest at 9 h post-injection, inferring that the concentration of rPPH@AZD at the tumor site reaches the highest level. These results demonstrate that rPPH@AZD could be accurately enriched into A549 tumor tissues with high CD44 receptor expression through blood circulation. (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>) displays the fluorescence images of the mice&#8217;s tumor and major organs after 24 h injection of rPPH@AZD. Fluorescence emissions from the tumor and liver are observed, showing that some rPPH@AZD still remain in the tumor after 24 h and are metabolized by the liver. The rapid accumulation of rPPH@AZD in the tumor site is attributed to the active targeting effect of HA, which improves the utilization rate of rPPH@AZD and enhances the tumor treatment effect. This demonstrates that rPPH@AZD makes the in vivo distribution, metabolism and targeting of multifunctional nano-delivery systems more convenient and visual through in vivo optical imaging.</p><p>The combined therapeutic effects of rPPH@AZD for NSCLC were assessed through in vivo anti-tumor experiments on mice. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows (a) the relative change in tumor volume and (b) body weight of mice during 14 days of treatments: Mice were treated with saline, 660 and 808 nm (NIR), rPPH, rPPH@AZD (chemotherapy), rPPH with 808 nm (PTT), rPPH with 660 nm (PDT), and rPPH@AZD with 660 and 808 nm (chemotherapy/PTT/PDT). The body weight of the mice does not change much for all the treatments (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that the nanomaterials in the treatment group had no side effects on mice. There are continual growths of tumors for those mice subjected to saline, NIR and rPPH treatments, indicating that these treatments have no inhibition effect on the tumors. The tumor growth rates are slightly lower for mice subjected to chemotherapy, PTT and PDT treatments. However, mice with the combined chemotherapy/PTT/PDT treatment can efficiently inhibit the growth of tumor. More importantly, the tumor diminishes in size and eventually vanishes after 10 days of treatment. The combination therapy can induce simultaneous heat stress and oxidative stress in cancer cells, leading to the disruption of their heat resistance mechanism and activation of the apoptosis pathway. As a result, the combined therapy exerts a synergistic effect while allowing for lower treatment temperatures and improved safety. (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">d</xref>) display the pictures of tumors and mice under various treatments. (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>) depicts the H &amp; E staining of tumor tissue sections of mice subjected to various treatments. No abnormality is found in the tumor tissue sections for saline, NIR and rPPH treatments. Tumor cells showed normal morphology with clearly visible cell membranes and nuclei. There is a small amount of cell necrosis for mice with PTT and PDT treatments. Noticeably, the tissue sections in the combined chemotherapy/PTT/PDT group displayed the largest ablation area. And the tumor cells showed obvious destruction with nuclear condensation leading to cell apoptosis and necrosis. Our results prove that the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy/PTT/PDT is significantly better than that of other single treatment modalities. rPPH@AZD could achieve good combined therapeutic effect without any significant ex vivo and in vivo toxicity in mice. The safety and high efficacy of this nanomaterial provide ideas for designing new therapeutic strategies for tumor.

In liver function tests, AST and ALT are the standards for judging whether liver cells are damaged. BUN and CRE are the body&#8217;s nitrogen catabolism products. Their specific concentrations are closely related to the excretion capacity of the kidneys and can reflect the degree of damage to kidney function. All these indices indicate that rPPH@AZD is safe for the mice. Hematological parameters, liver function indicators and renal function indicators are within the normal range, implying that rPPH@AZD induces negligible in vivo toxicity and has good biosafety.</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, a nanodrug delivery system (rPPH@AZD) based on mesoporous graphene oxide nanocomposite was developed. The obtained rPPH@AZD can maximize its accumulation at tumor site by active tumor-targeting effect endowed by HA. After tumoral accumulation, rPPH@AZD generates ROS and heat after laser irradiation at the tumor site and combines with the targeted anti-tumor drug Osimertinib for chemo/photo therapy. rPPH @AZD possesses pH/hyaluronidase dual responsive drug release behavior, which will facilitate the controlled release of AZD in the weakly acidic TME; thus, this study overcomes the shortcomings of single therapy and provides a reference for further exploration of chemo/photo combination therapy. More importantly, rPPH @AZD has excellent photothermal imaging and fluorescence imaging capabilities. Armed with its excellent imaging performance and effective therapy, rPPH@AZD is anticipated to have a unique tumor detection and treatment system. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have also demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility of rPPH@AZD. As a nanoplatform for combination therapy, rPPH@AZD is worthy of further research. In summary, this study provides new ideas for the construction of TME-responsive nanodrug delivery systems and provides a theoretical basis for clinical combination treatment of
