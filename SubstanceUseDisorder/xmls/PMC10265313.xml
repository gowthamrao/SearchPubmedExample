For example, Medicaid agencies in 33 states authorized reimbursement for audio-only telehealth services among Medicaid and Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, executive orders established payment parity, the requirement that health plans provide equal reimbursement for telehealth and in-person services.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Similarly, many states joined compacts, such as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) and the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), which allow psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, respectively, to practice telehealth across state lines.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230548r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The extent and timing of policy adoption varied widely across states.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230548r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This temporal and geographic heterogeneity provides an opportunity to assess the associations between major state policies and expansion of telehealth availability throughout the US. Knowing whether and to what extent these policies were factors in expansion of telehealth services for mental health treatment is important not only for judging their merit but also for understanding the potential ramifications of ending these policies, which may occur at the expiration of the national COVID-19 public health emergency (May 11, 2023).<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This knowledge is particularly relevant in the context of telehealth expansion, as many states used temporary measures that are set to expire.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the associations between 4 state policies and telehealth availability at outpatient mental health treatment facilities throughout the US.

This information was tracked using MATTR, which catalogs the dates and responses from facilities to SAMHSA regarding telehealth&#8217;s availability as a service modality. We selected quarterly intervals because facilities are not obligated to report changes in service delivery to SAMHSA on a daily or weekly basis; rather, they are expected to provide routine updates. After reviewing SAMHSA data files, we determined that quarterly intervals were commensurate with the temporal resolution of reporting. Data were unavailable for the third quarter of 2021.</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-ZOI230548"><title>Covariates</title><p>To account for variation in mental health treatment facility characteristics, we included 2 indicator variables: one indicating whether the facility accepted Medicaid as a form of payment, and the other indicating whether the facility self-identified as a community mental health center (CMHC).<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Using data from the 2020 American Community Survey,<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> we also incorporated characteristics from counties in which each facility was located. The data included the percentage of residents who self-identified as Black individuals (4 groups: &#8804;5, &gt;5-10, &gt;10-20, or &gt;20), percentage of residents who self-identified as Hispanic individuals (4 groups: &#8804;5, &gt;5-10, &gt;10-20, or &gt;20), percentage of residents aged 0 to 17 years (dichotomized: &#8804;25 or &gt;25), percentage of residents 65 years or older (dichotomized: &#8804;15 or &gt;15), percentage of households without internet access (dichotomized: &#8804;15 or &gt;15), and percentage of residents participating in public assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (dichotomized: &#8804;10 or &gt;10). County urbanicity was also classified based on the Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC), with counties classified as urban (RUCC 1-3) or rural (RUCC 4-9). Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were selected as covariates because they represented the 2 largest population groups among whom disparities in access to health services are consistently documented.</p><p>We included an indicator for state Medicaid expansion status.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Based on the Kaiser Family Foundation database of state Medicaid expansion dates,<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> we created quarterly indicators denoting whether a state had enacted Medicaid expansion.</p></sec><sec id="H2-5-ZOI230548"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We used longitudinal, multivariable fixed-effects logistic regression to estimate the difference in the probability that mental health treatment facilities would offer telehealth services in quarters after policy implementation compared with quarters before policy implementation.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Separate regression models were estimated for each state policy. In addition to the dichotomous policy indicator (yes or no), we included all facility-, county-, and state-level covariates. Fixed effects were included for each state and year, and cluster-robust SEs were clustered at the facility level.</p><p>In addition to the main fixed-effects models, we conducted 2 secondary analyses examining effect modification. First, in a single model with no policy indicators, we initiated interaction between 3 county-level characteristics (rural vs urban, percentage of Black residents, and percentage of Hispanic residents) and year to assess whether temporal trends in telehealth availability over the analytic period differed according to the counties&#8217; racial and ethnic composition and urbanicity. Second, considering each policy separately, we generated interaction between each of these 3 county-level characteristics and the policy indicator to assess whether the associations between policies and expansion of telehealth availability differed by the racial and ethnic composition and urbanicity of the counties.</p><p>Significance testing for interaction terms was conducted using omnibus &#967;<sup>2</sup> tests, and we estimated predictive margins of telehealth availability that corresponded to subgroups defined by these interaction terms.

Specifically, mental health treatment facilities that accepted Medicaid had significantly lower odds of offering telehealth services compared with facilities that did not accept Medicaid (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.86), and CMHCs were significantly more likely to offer telehealth services than other facility types (AOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.53). Facilities in rural counties were significantly more likely to offer telehealth services compared with facilities in urban counties (AOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.48-1.88). Facilities in counties in which more than 10% of residents were participating in public assistance programs were significantly more likely to offer telehealth services (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), as were facilities in counties in which more than 15% of households lacked internet access (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30).</p><p>The percentage of Black residents in the county was inversely associated with telehealth availability. Compared with counties with 5% or fewer Black residents, counties with more than 20% Black residents had 42% lower odds of offering telehealth services (AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50-0.68). In contrast, the proportions of county residents who identified as Hispanic individuals, were aged 0 to 17 years, or were 65 years or older were not associated with the odds of a facility offering telehealth services.</p></sec><sec id="H2-8-ZOI230548"><title>Effect Modification</title><p>In the first set of interaction models between county-level characteristics (rural vs urban, percentage of Black residents, and percentage of Hispanic residents) and year, we found significant evidence of differential time trends by rurality and percentage of Black residents. As shown in <xref rid="zoi230548f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the rural-urban gap in telehealth availability was pronounced in 2019 (55% of rural facilities vs 38% of urban facilities) but systematically narrowed over the study period (2022: 88% of rural facilities vs 85% of urban facilities). Additionally, differences in telehealth availability across counties based on the percentage of Black residents decreased over the study period such that availability was similar in 2022 for counties with 20% or fewer Black residents. However, throughout the study period, counties with more than 20% Black residents had consistently lower telehealth availability.</p><fig position="float" id="zoi230548f3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 3. </label><caption><title>Telehealth Policy Adoption by County Characteristics From 2019 to 2022</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jamanetwopen-e2318045-g003.jpg"/></fig><p>In the second set of interaction models between policies of interest and county-level characteristics, we found that for 3 of 4 policies (payment parity, audio-only authorization, and IMLC participation), policy implementation was associated with greater expansion of telehealth availability in urban vs rural counties (eAppendix 4 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230548-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, payment parity and audio-only authorization policies were associated with greater expansion of telehealth availability in counties with a higher proportion (&gt;20%) of Black residents. Audio-only authorization was also associated with greater expansion of telehealth availability in communities with a higher proportion (&gt;20%) of Hispanic residents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI230548"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study was one of the first investigations into the association between state policies and expanded telehealth availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that all 4 policies were associated with greater telehealth availability over time.</p><p>Medicaid and CHIP reimbursement for audio-only telehealth services was associated with a 73% higher likelihood of telehealth availability. This result is notable for 2 reasons. First, apart from Medicare, Medicaid is the largest insurer in the US, with more than 90 million enrollees as of 2021.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Second, Medicaid serves a high-needs population: approximately 50% of Medicaid beneficiaries who are eligible based on a disability have 1 or more behavioral health diagnoses, and Medicaid is the largest single payer for behavioral health services.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230548r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, we also found that mental health treatment facilities that accepted Medicaid as a form of insurance were, overall, less likely to offer telehealth services throughout the analytic period regardless of the status of any given policy. This finding is consistent with prior studies indicating that Medicaid and CHIP recipients may have reduced access to outpatient care compared with individuals with private insurance.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>State participation in PSYPACT and IMLC corresponded to 21% (AOR, 1.21) and 40% (AOR, 1.40) greater likelihood, respectively, of a facility expanding to offer telehealth services, whereas payment parity was associated with an 11% (AOR, 1.11) greater likelihood. Interstate compacts offer a vehicle for facilities and their clinicians to broaden reach of services, although the extent to which this expansion occurs has not been well documented. However, it is likely that these associations are most consistently observed in urban hubs close to state boundaries, such as New York City or Washington, DC.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Clinicians may also preferentially select clients from other states if they pay out of pocket or present with a more generous insurer.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p>We anticipated that payment parity would be associated with expanded telehealth availability, which was not observed. One explanation for this finding is that, historically, enforcement of parity laws has been weak,<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and mental health treatment facilities may have been skeptical about the extent to which private insurers would be forthcoming with telehealth reimbursement. Another explanation is that even prior to the payment parity policy, insurers may have offered partial reimbursement. Payment parity remains contentious, with some arguing that telehealth may be lower in cost and lower in value than in-person care, and reimbursement rates should reflect this.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Payment parity is also the policy that is most likely to regress as it tends to rely on temporary executive orders.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>This study found some evidence that state policies were differentially associated with expansion of telehealth availability in some demographic groups compared with others. For example, audio-only authorization was associated with larger expansion of telehealth availability in counties with more than 20% Black residents than in counties with a predominantly White population (&#8804;5% Black residents). However, time trends also showed that, over the analytic period, disparities in telehealth availability persisted for several groups, including Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and Black residents. Facilities that accepted Medicaid and CHIP were approximately 25% less likely to offer telehealth services, and facilities in counties with a high proportion (&gt;20%) of Black residents were 42% less likely to offer telehealth services compared with facilities in counties with predominantly White residents (&#8804;5% Black residents). Taken together, these findings indicated that state policies were associated with increased telehealth coverage; however, targeted policies are still required to advance equity in access among underserved populations.</p><p>Additionally, we found evidence that greater telehealth availability in rural vs urban counties shrank over the study period. Consistent with prior research,<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> the present study showed that before the pandemic, telehealth was a modality that was most common in rural areas. However, throughout the pandemic, telehealth availability increased more rapidly in urban areas. In a post-COVID-19 era, this availability raises questions about equity in access, as those living in rural areas may once again have greater need for reliance on telehealth services.</p><p>Overall, the observed rapid growth in telehealth services for mental health care, from 39.4% in 2019 to 88.1% in 2022, suggests that state policies served an important role. This role should be viewed within the broader context of increased acceptability of telehealth over the same period<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> as well as accumulating evidence that telehealth is an effective modality for delivering many specific mental health services.<sup><xref rid="zoi230548r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-9-ZOI230548"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, information on availability of telehealth services relied on mental health treatment facilities reporting to SAMHSA. Second, when measuring the association between policies and telehealth availability, we used the date on which the policy was formalized or ratified. However, the policies may take weeks or months to implement. Similarly, the contents of individual policies varied across states and over time. For this analysis, we simplified policies into discrete categories. Third, omitted variable bias could alter the estimation effects. We attempted to address this issue by incorporating facility-level and county-level characteristics. Fourth, the analysis focused on telehealth availability for outpatient services; it did not provide insights on service volume or the associations with inpatient services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI230548"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this national cohort study, 4 state policies were associated with a consistently greater likelihood of telehealth availability at mental health treatment facilities in the US. Despite these policies, certain groups remained underserved: Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and Black individuals. This finding underscores the need for targeted local legislation that could sustain and further expand access to telehealth services.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI230548"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi230548r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>NEJM Catalyst</collab></person-group>.
