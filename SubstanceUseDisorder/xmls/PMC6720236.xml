About 12% of global deaths were linked to smoking in 2015.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is substantial evidence that smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> For instance, it is estimated that 14% of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) cases worldwide are attributable to smoking.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Smoking is thought to accelerate the onset of dementia mainly via vascular risk factors such as narrowing of blood vessels in the heart and the brain, thereby triggering oxidative stress.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>
</p><p>Few studies report smoking prevalence among people with dementia. In a cross-sectional analysis of patients treated for AD in a neurology clinic during a 2-year period, previous smoking prevalence was 29% (N=21/72).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In a case&#8211;control study of patients with vascular dementia, the rate of current tobacco use was 9% (N=17/198) as compared with 6% (N=11/199) in the control group.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Beyond the harmful health effects of smoking in people with dementia, there are concerns that smokers in this group may have a higher likelihood of fire accidents due to their compromised cognitive state.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>Since there are currently no available treatments to cure dementia, there is a growing interest in identifying modifiable risk factors for reducing the occurrence of the disease, to delay dementia onset, and reduce its burden.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 9</xref> Smoking cessation could potentially decrease the risk or slow the development of dementia<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and could improve the quality of life of older adults through improved physical, and mental well-being.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11</xref> Little is known about whether people with dementia are prescribed smoking cessation agents and whether they are effective in this group.</p><p>Based on a Cochrane review of 136 trials, it was reported that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (compared with placebo or no treatment) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking (Hartmann-Boyce <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Data from observational studies<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> indicate that varenicline is more effective than single form NRT for smoking cessation in the general population. However, it is unclear whether varenicline or NRT could help smokers with dementia to quit smoking.</p><p>Therefore, in this study we aimed to (1) describe the rates of smoking prevalence and smoking cessation medication prescribing among people with and without general practitioner (GP)-recorded dementia in UK primary care settings from 2007 to 2015 and (2) assess and compare associations of varenicline and NRT on smoking cessation in people with GP-recorded dementia, compared with those without, at 3, 6, 9 months and 1, 2, 4 years after first prescription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data source and population</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from 683 general practices in England from 2007 to 2015 using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

The proportion of people with and without dementia who quit smoking after being prescribed either varenicline or NRT increased throughout the study&#8217;s follow-up period (3&#8201;months to 4&#8201;years). At 2-year follow-up, people with dementia were more likely to quit smoking (30.6%, 95%&#8201;CI 25.8% to 35.1%) than those without (25.7%, 95%&#8201;CI 25.4% to 25.8%) when prescribed either varenicline or NRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary eTable 6</xref>).

There was no clear evidence for a difference in quit rates in individuals with and without dementia following prescription of NRT or varenicline.</p><p>A strength of this study is that we used primary care data from the CPRD which are representative of the UK primary care population.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Hence, smoking rates in people with dementia in this study are likely to be generalisable to the dementia population in the UK and in similar countries. Additionally, we used expert-reviewed codelists to define both the exposure and the outcome which would reduce misclassification bias (ie, classifying people with dementia as people without and vice versa).</p><p>There are several limitations to this research. Due to the small sample size of people with dementia, we were not able to test the relative effectiveness of varenicline versus NRT on smoking cessation using regression models. We had no data on smokers who purchase over-the-counter NRT, therefore we might be underestimating the prevalence of NRT use, particularly among people without dementia. Hence, it is likely that the prevalence of NRT use among people without dementia is larger than the prevalence of NRT prescribing in this study. Moreover, outcome definition (smoking vs non-smoking status) was based on self-reported data rather than biochemical verification of smoking status. Additionally, social desirability bias may occur when unsuccessful quitters don&#8217;t disclose their smoking status truthfully. We also relied on point estimates (ie, smoking status reported at a single timepoint) for making conclusions about smoking status. This may not have captured long-term abstinence. In other words, it is possible that smoking status may have fluctuated between GP visits. A further limitation is having no information about patient adherence in taking their prescribed smoking cessation medications.</p><p>We are not aware of previous population-based studies that estimated the smoking rates among people with dementia as the available evidence has been limited to small cross-sectional studies. For instance, a community study in China found that about 17% (N=69/186) of the elderly sample with dementia were current smokers compared with 25% (N=415/1664) in people without dementia.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Results from the Toyama dementia survey in Japan show that only 4% of people with dementia smoked compared with 10% in those without.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This high variability in the results points to the need for larger and more representative studies in people with dementia to be conducted. Meanwhile, we found that smoking prevalence has decreased steadily among people without dementia, from 26% in 2007 to 21% in 2015. This was fairly similar to the general population in England as evidenced by results from the Smoking Toolkit Study (24.2% in 2007 to 18.7% in 2015)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and therefore speaks to the external validity of our study.</p><p>We observed a low prevalence of varenicline prescribing during our study period in people with dementia. Our estimate for individuals without dementia was consistent with findings from a previous study that examined the use of varenicline for smoking cessation treatment in UK primary care using data from THIN database in 2011. Compared with our results from that year, our estimates appear slightly lower (1.1% vs 1.8% in the THIN study).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> While NRT prescribing rates increased from 4% in 2007 to 5% in 2015 in people with dementia, these rates declined over time in people without dementia. A recent report from the British Lung Foundation found that NRT prescribing through primary care in England has dropped about 75% during the last 10 years. That was mainly due to cuts to public health funding that would have adversely impacted specialist stop smoking services.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Our study is among the first to investigate longer term smoking cessation after being prescribed varenicline and NRT among individuals with dementia in a real world setting. Our results suggest that both varenicline and NRT could produce long-term smoking cessation in people with dementia as they do in those without. Almost one-third of smokers with dementia quit smoking after 2-year follow-up. Regardless of the smoking cessation medication prescribed to people with dementia, it is important to acknowledge that achieving smoking cessation in this group may carry health benefits which would potentially improve their general health status and and/or extend life expectancy.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This should ideally be coupled with improving diet quality and increasing physical activites that may shield quitters from weight gain after smoking cessation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p><p>It is not clear why individuals with dementia are less likely to be prescribed varenicline than NRT compared with individuals without. Previous clinical and observational studies have established that varenicline is superior to single form NRT in achieving smoking cessation in different groups.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 30 31</xref> Additionally, varenicline did not seem to be associated with an increased risk of documented cardiovascular events, depression or self-harm when compared with NRT in primary care in England.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> On the other hand, a recent study based on CPRD data concluded that NRT appears to increase cardiovascular events for patients prescribed NRT, compared with those receiving smoking cessation advice after 52 weeks of follow-up.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This was consistent with the evidence shown by a meta-analysis of 120 studies involving 177 390 individuals.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is possible that GPs are less likely to prescribe varenicline to individuals with dementia because of lower likelihood of adherence; in a recent systematic review of the literature, older patients with dementia were found to have a low level of medication adherence.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>In summary, age-adjusted and sex-adjusted smoking prevalence among individuals with dementia was similar to those without dementia and smoking cessation rates were similar following prescription of smoking cessation medications between these groups. However, individuals with dementia were less likely to be prescribed varenicline than individuals without dementia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e318" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-027569.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e319" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-027569.draft_revisions.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TI contributed to data cleaning, data analysis, interpretation of results and writing the manuscript.
