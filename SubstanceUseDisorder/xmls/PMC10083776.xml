Such infections require prolonged antibiotic therapy, but there is limited evidence about the optimal care model to deliver to this population. The Epidemiology and Management of invasive infections among people who Use drugs (EMU) study aims to (1) describe the current burden, clinical spectrum, management and outcomes of invasive infections in PWID; (2) determine the impact of currently available models of care on completion of planned antimicrobials for PWID admitted to hospital with invasive infections and (3) determine postdischarge outcomes of PWID admitted with invasive infections at 30 and 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>EMU is a prospective multicentre cohort study of Australian public hospitals who provide care to PWIDs with invasive infections. All patients who have injected drugs in the previous six&#8201;months and are admitted to a participating site for management of an invasive infection are eligible. EMU has two components: (1) EMU-Audit will collect information from medical records, including demographics, clinical presentation, management and outcomes; (2) EMU-Cohort will augment this with interviews at baseline, 30 and 90 days post-discharge, and data linkage examining readmission rates and mortality. The primary exposure is antimicrobial treatment modality, categorised as inpatient intravenous antimicrobials, outpatient antimicrobial therapy, early oral antibiotics or lipoglycopeptide. The primary outcome is confirmed completion of planned antimicrobials. We aim to recruit 146 participants over a 2-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>EMU has been approved by the Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (Project number 78815.) EMU-Audit will collect non-identifiable data with a waiver of consent. EMU-Cohort will collect identifiable data with informed consent. Findings will be presented at scientific conferences and disseminated by peer-review publications.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12622001173785; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>INFECTIOUS DISEASES</kwd><kwd>Substance misuse</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1141398</award-id><award-id>GNT1166499</award-id><award-id>GNT2002670</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This multicentre study will be the largest prospective description of people who inject drugs (PWID) hospitalised for invasive infection in Australia, and heterogeneity of treatment modalities between sites will facilitate comparison of antimicrobial treatment plans.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The two components of the Epidemiology and Management of invasive infections among people who Use drugs (EMU) study will optimise recruitment for this population who have been traditionally under-represented in research: waiver of consent to collect non-identifiable epidemiological and clinical data from all participants (EMU-Audit), with more detailed patient experience measures during hospitalisation, post-discharge follow-up and data-linkage of the subset of consenting participants (EMU-Cohort).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results of this study have the potential to inform a patient-centred multidisciplinary model of care for PWID admitted to hospital with invasive infections and will provide valuable descriptive data to inform future randomised trials.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants may be missed if accurate histories regarding drug use are not sought or documented in hospital records.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While we aim to measure and adjust for confounders, a risk of residual bias from unmeasured confounding remains and the direction of this bias is difficult to predict.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Background and rationale</title><p>Bacterial and fungal infections are a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in people who inject drugs (PWID). Infections can range from localised skin and soft-tissue infections such as cellulitis, to systemic invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, infective endocarditis (IE), bone and joint infections and epidural abscesses.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;4</xref>
</p><p>Worldwide, hospitalisations for infections related to injecting drug use are increasing.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 5&#8211;11</xref> In the USA, there was an 18-fold increase in hospitalisations for &#8216;bacteraemia/sepsis&#8217; among PWIDs in Oregon between 2008 and 2018<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> while the proportion of candidaemia cases with a documented history of injecting drug use in the past 12 months more than doubled across four US sites between 2014 and 2017.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In England, there has been an annual increase in hospital admission linked to opioid-use related bacterial infections in all age groups since 2012.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This increase has also been seen in Australia, with the rate of IE related to injecting drug use rising from 0.9 to 1.8 per 100&#8201;000 people per year between 2009 and 2014.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>Management of these invasive infections is complex and often requires prolonged antimicrobial courses and/or surgery as well as the assessment of substance dependence, mental health and social issues.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#8211;16</xref> Furthermore, PWID hospitalised with infectious complications often incur longer hospital admissions and are readmitted more frequently than non-injecting drug use related hospitalisations for the same infections.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7 17 18</xref> However, the burden, clinical-spectrum, management and outcomes of invasive infections among PWIDs in Australia are poorly described. Current prevalence data are predominantly driven by self-reporting, with significant gaps in objective data describing the burden of invasive infections.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These gaps are reflected in the substantial variation in care delivery between hospitals and clinicians. Management at Australian hospitals is significantly influenced by policy at an institution level rather than individual patient characteristics, and can vary from refusing anyone with a history of injecting drug use onto outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) programmes to supporting their transition to community-based care.</p><p>Understanding the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive infections in PWID is essential to inform an evidence-based model of care for this population. Among PWIDs with invasive infections, completion of planned antimicrobial therapy is likely to be an important predictor of patient outcomes including treatment success and engagement with care. Current antimicrobial management strategies for invasive infections in PWID can be broadly divided into receipt of mainly inpatient intravenous antimicrobials, predominantly outpatient intravenous antimicrobials or prolonged oral antimicrobials. There is also emerging use of long-acting antimicrobials such as lipoglycopeptides (eg, dalbavancin).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;23</xref> While there has traditionally been a resistance to enrolling PWID in OPAT programmes,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> there is an increasing evidence base indicating that OPAT is likely safe and effective in PWID, with comparable rates of therapy completion to people without a history of injecting drug use.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, there is a paucity of evidence to quantify the effect different models of care may have on the probability of completion of planned antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Objectives</title><p>We will perform a prospective multicentre cohort study of PWID admitted to public hospitals for the treatment of invasive infections to address these knowledge gaps. Our study aims are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Describe the current burden, clinical spectrum, management and outcomes of invasive infections in PWID.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine the impact of currently available models of care on completion of planned antimicrobials for PWID admitted to hospital with invasive infections.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine postdischarge outcomes of PWID admitted with invasive infections at 30 and 90 days.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Objective 1 is descriptive.

With a waiver of consent, EMU-Audit will collect non-identifiable standard of care information regarding patient admission, demographics, management and outcomes. EMU-Cohort is a subset of EMU-Audit participants who consent to baseline, 30-day and 90-day post-discharge interviews and/or data linkage for eligible Victorian participants.</p><p>PWID are frequently excluded or under-represented in clinical trials, which has limited the evidence base available to make treatment recommendations in this population. The waiver of consent will allow standard of care data to be collected for all eligible participants in EMU-Audit. EMU-Cohort will allow the collection of more detailed demographic, epidemiological and outcome data as well as follow-up of consenting participants.</p><p>The EMU protocol was drafted adhering to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study setting</title><p>Study sites are Australian public hospitals who provide care to PWID with invasive infections. These sites can include hospitals from all states and territories in Australia, though it is expected that most sites will be in the state of Victoria due to the location of the study authors. Participating sites do not need to have a dedicated infectious diseases inpatient team, though will have an infectious diseases consult service as a minimum. Patients can be admitted to other medical or surgical units. All sites will participate in EMU-Audit but may elect not to participate in EMU-Cohort. Study recruitment period will be November 2021&#8211;November 2023.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Participants are eligible if they are aged &#8805;18 years, self-report injecting drug use within the previous 6&#8201;months and are admitted to hospital for management of a proven or presumed invasive infection. Asking about a history of injecting drug use is standard of care when investigating invasive infections. Thus, documentation of this history is expected to be recorded within the medical history of patients with invasive infections.</p><p>We define invasive infections as treating physician diagnosis (proven or presumed) of the following infections: IE, epidural abscess, bone and joint infections (including acute osteomyelitis, septic arthritis or acute prosthetic joint infections), deep abscess (such as muscle/lung/liver/spleen/cerebral) and bloodstream infections.</p><p>Participants can be enrolled in EMU-Audit multiple times if they have multiple eligible admissions during the study period. If participants represent to a study site with an eligible infection after a planned discharge, or 48 hours or more after patient directed discharge (PDD), we will include them as a new record in EMU-Audit and note the study ID of their previous record. A PDD is a discharge led by the patient, which has previously been referred to as &#8216;discharge against medical advice.&#8217;</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants admitted for management of infections other than invasive bacterial or fungal infections are not eligible. This includes those admitted for the management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> only, viral infection only (including hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV), or viral or bacterial meningitis only with no evidence of invasive infection as defined above. Individuals who are admitted for a reason unrelated to an acute infection (such as trauma), who subsequently develop an invasive infection are not eligible.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for EMU-Cohort are as above but also include the refusal or inability to provide informed consent. The study team may miss the opportunity of discussing the project with potential participants during their admission if they are not medically stable or there are behavioural concerns impacting clinical care and deemed not suitable to approach for research. Individuals with no method of contact for follow-up questionnaires will be excluded from EMU-Cohort, but participants from hospitals within the state of Victoria may consent to data linkage component only. Data linkage will not be available for participants from hospitals outside of Victoria, please see further information about data-linkage in the &#8216;Data collection&#8217; section. A participant can only be enrolled in EMU-Cohort once.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Participant recruitment and sampling strategy</title><p>Eligible participants will be identified by site investigators by reviewing infectious diseases inpatients and consults for individuals who meet the above eligibility criteria. Site investigators may be notified of eligible individuals by treating teams.

Verbal consent may be requested if in person recruitment cannot take place.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection will occur for each participant on study entry and at the completion of EMU-Audit follow-up, which is defined by death, planned discharge or PDD if the participant does not return for ongoing inpatient care with 48 hours. Participant discharge is defined as the end of a hospital episode, which includes inpatient admission and OPAT admission. Participants enrolled in EMU-Cohort will have additional data collected on enrolment during hospitalisation, and at 30 and 90 days post-discharge. Individual entries will be allocated a unique study ID. Short breaks in therapy during an admission period, including PDD, will be captured in one case file if a break in treatment is not greater than 48 hours and readmission permits the continued planned antimicrobial therapy without any new confirmed or presumed infection. A new REDCap<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> case entry will be required if there is a PDD &gt;48&#8201;hours or there is a new infection. If a site indicates within REDCap that the participant has had a previous EMU-Audit admission documented, they will be asked to record the study ID of that previous record.</p><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>EMU-Audit: entry data</title><p>On entry into EMU-Audit, baseline information will be collected using REDCap data collection forms with site specific access allocated to study investigators at each site. Baseline information will include participant demographics, limited comorbidities, drug history and clinical presentation. This information will be non-identifiable with only standard of care information collected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>EMU-Audit: discharge data</title><p>Discharge data collected will include discharge diagnosis and microbiology, management including surgery, addiction medicine review and intensive care unit requirements, antimicrobials received and associated complications, personal threat codes for behaviours impacting care, mortality in hospital, length of stay and discharge disposition. Information about antimicrobials received will also include the planned duration of antimicrobials, whether the participant received that duration and if not, how long a participant did receive antimicrobials for. For participants discharged with an OPAT service, this information will be collected at the end of their OPAT admission. This is because in Australian hospitals, participants remain &#8216;admitted&#8217; under a hospital service while with an OPAT service. At the Alfred Hospital site, bacterial isolates from standard of care clinical samples collected during participants&#8217; admission will be stored with a non-identifiable study code, for potential future analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-3"><title>EMU-Cohort: entry data</title><p>On enrolment into EMU-Cohort, participants will undergo an interview with a study investigator by contact on a dedicated study mobile phone or in person.

The Centre for Victorian Data Linkage (CVDL) will link cohort data from participating Victorian sites to facilitate postdischarge follow-up for emergency department presentations (Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset, VEMD), hospital admissions (Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset) and mortality status (Victorian Death Index). This will be used to assess mortality and readmission rates at 30 days, 90 days and over subsequent years. Datasets will be linked by deterministic linkage, utilising Medicare number, first name, last name, hospital unique record number (URN), date of birth and sex. A separation principle will be applied to data flow to ensure participant confidentiality. It is anticipated that data linkage extractions will occur at the three time points, to provide crucial information about short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes of this cohort. The time points are: 12 months following last participant recruited, to obtain 30-day and 90-day follow-up data; 3&#8201;years post last participant recruited, to obtain 2&#8201;year follow-up data; and 6&#8201;years post last participant recruited, to obtain 5&#8201;year follow-up data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Exposure of interest</title><p>The primary exposure of interest is the treatment modality used to administer antimicrobial therapy for each individual participant.

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> found that 28% of patients had &#8216;negotiated discharges&#8217; (ie, received oral antimicrobials to complete their treatment) and their study was conducted in an American setting (compared with the Australian setting which has universal healthcare coverage). Therefore, a completion rate of 65% was assumed for the inpatient treatment group in this study.</p><p>Previous studies of OPAT completion in PWID have demonstrated completion rates ranging from 72% to 100%.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Many of these studies only enrolled PWID who met strict enrolment criteria.

We estimated a completion rate in the outpatient group of 85%.</p><p>Assuming 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, 73 participants per treatment group will allow the detection of a difference between a confirmed completion rate of 65% in the inpatient treatment group and 85% in the OPAT treatment group. We aim to recruit 146 participants in groups 1 and 2 of the exposure of interest groups (inpatient intravenous antimicrobials and OPAT) combined. However, as rate of recruitment is dependent in part on hospital policies regarding discharging PWIDs onto OPAT, we have calculated different sample size scenarios that will still allow us to detect this difference depending on recruitment (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).

The completion rates for participants in the early oral antimicrobial therapy group and the long acting lipoglycopeptide groups will be analysed as secondary outcomes.

The impact of treatment modality on completion of planned antimicrobial will be determined using logistic regression with random effects for hospital (if needed) and adjusted for confounders. Confounders will include active injecting drug use (within the last 3&#8201;months), current homelessness, predominant injecting substance (opioid vs amphetamine) and opioid agonist therapy (methadone/buprenorphine with naloxone (suboxone)/buprenorphine) as these have traditionally influenced whether patients are considered appropriate for discharge with an OPAT system in Australian hospitals.

Our study design has the distinct advantage of providing flexibility to recruiting sites through the two components of EMU-Audit and EMU-Cohort. This will allow for recruitment of participants with a waiver of consent, to ensure collection of crucial data in a patient population who are often excluded, under-represented or not able to engage in research. The novel data produced from the EMU study will help contribute to the design of a patient-informed evidence-based model of care for the management of invasive infections in PWID. Furthermore, the data from this study may help contribute to strategies to prevent invasive infections and hospitalisations in PWID. Preventing invasive infections and averting non-invasive infections from progressing to invasive infections would also not only decrease morbidity but also limit healthcare costs.</p><p>Despite the strengths of the study, the design presents some inherent limitations. First, EMU-Audit relies on information documented in the medical records. PWID frequently describe stigma, especially during healthcare encounters.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> Injecting drug use may not be disclosed by patients due to concern regarding stigma and altered management when seeking care. If a patient does not disclose their injecting history, they will not be recruited. However, asking about injecting habits is standard of care when investigating invasive infections and thus should be captured in the admission information. For EMU-Audit, collection of outcomes is limited to those that occurred within the healthcare system with care captured within the medical chart. Of note, we will be unable to collect the primary outcome for participants in EMU-Audit discharged on early oral antimicrobials. The subset of EMU-Cohort will provide further in-depth analysis for data missing in the EMU-Audit group. We acknowledge that the follow-up of EMU-Cohort participants at 30-day and 90-day may pose a challenge. To encourage participation and thank participants for their time, small monetary reimbursements are provided to participants after each EMU-cohort interview.</p><p>As an observational study comparing treatment options, EMU is at risk of confounding by indication. While we will measure and adjust for factors likely to confound the relationship between acceptance into OPAT and completion of planned antimicrobial therapy (such as drug use history, unstable housing, engagement in opioid agonist therapy and illness severity), we acknowledge the risk of residual bias. Once clinically stable, acceptance of PWIDs into OPAT services for completion of intravenous antimicrobial therapy is substantially influenced by hospital policy rather than patient-level characteristics. This variation between rather than within institution effectively represents a natural experiment. However, we will account for potential patient-level confounders by including these as covariates in multivariable regression, and include hospitals as a random effect to account for clustering at organisation level. We also acknowledge that there is the risk of a lack of precision in results due to our chosen sample size. However, the chosen differences in completion rates (65% vs 85%) were based on recently published literature.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 29 30</xref> Results will also be reported with CIs to convey uncertainty in our estimates. Furthermore, the primary aim of the EMU study is descriptive and will provide valuable data to inform further interventional research.</p><p>In conclusion, the EMU study represents an innovative project design to gain better insights into the current burden of invasive infections among PWID as well as the outcomes related to the management strategy received. The knowledge gained from this cohort study will be instrumental in developing an evidence-based patient-centred model of care for PWID with invasive infections. In the long run, we aim to improve the prevention and management of invasive infections in PWID leading to improved outcomes in this stigmatised population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e258" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-070236.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e259" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
