In Sweden, a large number of young people are in contact with ASU treatment facilities. Treatment is often provided at so-called Maria clinics, staffed with both medical and psychosocial professionals and located in municipalities across the country. While adolescents may come into contact with these services for various reasons, a common one is having being caught using substances that are illicit in Sweden, in particular cannabis.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Treatment contact is often initiated by social or juridical authorities, and often not by adolescents or their personal networks,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> and ASU treatment in Sweden includes a heterogenous group of patients,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> ranging from adolescents who have tried illicit substances for the first time to polydrug users. The patient population is thus likely to include patients with different treatment trajectories,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> with some receiving more services than others. Estimates suggest that among those who initiate treatment at the Maria clinics, the majority has cannabis as their &#8220;primary&#8221; drug and this has increased over time from slightly more than 60% in 2010 to slightly less than 80% in 2021.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> Alcohol is the primary drug among a minority and the proportion having alcohol as their primary substance has decreased from about 30% in 2010 to about 10% in 2021. While the proportion who have received prior substance use treatment has been relatively stable over time, there has been a clear upward trend in the proportion with ongoing psychiatric care. Overall, the gender distribution has been quite stable (ranging from 70% to 77% males between 2013 and 2021) and the average age has been steady at 17&#8201;years.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup></p><p>However, Sweden&#8217;s largest regional, rather than municipal, ASU treatment provider &#8211; Maria Ungdom (MU) Stockholm &#8211; is not fully covered in these estimates, and geographical differences in the supply of services and in the collaboration between the social services and the regions entail that these estimates may not reflect the situation among a sizeable proportion of adolescents who are engaged in treatment. Moreover, inpatient care is not covered. Also, available studies from Sweden have seldom explored what and how much treatment is provided. This study, the first of its kind in Sweden in recent years, aims to examine treatment use (outpatient and inpatient) among all patients who during 2011 to 2021 had at least 1 contact with the Maria Ungdom Clinic (MU) in Stockholm. Compared to most previous research in this area, this large-scale study relies on routinely collected electronic health records and as such overcomes challenges related to self-reports (eg, recall bias) and under-coverage of certain populations in treatment studies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> The study focuses on treatment provision across different year cohorts and according to age at first contact with MU, as well as potential differences according to sex and treatment type (outpatient and inpatient). Given the shortage of studies of this kind, the study adopts an explorative approach.</p></sec><sec id="section6-29768357251351758"><title>Previous Research</title><p>There is a substantial literature on ASU. However, given the life phase adolescents are in, societal approaches to ASU are overall more focussed on prevention than on treatment.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> This imbalance is reflected in both research and monitoring efforts. For example, although many countries monitor trends in substance use in the general adolescent population, corresponding approaches are rarer in ASU populations. Monitoring efforts related to treatment, much of which come from the US, are typically based on larger community samples in which adolescents (and adults) are asked to self-report what kind of treatment they have received.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

<xref rid="bibr7-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup></p><p>Comparatively little is known about adolescents in substance use treatment and what treatment they are offered and engage in. Much of the research has been carried out in the US, and calls for more research have recently been made with reference to the Nordic countries.<sup>

For example, family and peer factors are often more important in ASU treatment,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> and adolescents typically do not present the type of withdrawal symptoms that are often observed among adults.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> Adolescents seldom seek treatment on their own accord and many are pressured into treatment.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> Consequently, they are less prone than adults to complete treatment.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> However, although the overall evidence base is somewhat scarce,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

</sup> which of course does not necessary mean that they have better outcomes. However, a recent systematic review of close to 100 studies found very few significant associations between characteristics such as age group, gender, and treatment setting and completion rates in adolescents and young adults.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> This points to the need for more research on, for example, who attends more treatment sessions or stays longer in treatment.</p><p>Missing in prior research is also a more extended temporal perspective, with most longitudinal studies covering a shorter time span, typically relying on self-reports and relatively small samples. We know comparably little about changes over longer periods of time among adolescents who are in ASU treatment. While there are some descriptive reports on temporal trends among patients in specialised municipal ASU treatment in Sweden, they focus more on the characteristics of the patients than what treatment they are provided and they do not include regional healthcare interventions.<sup>

This research does not consider outcome studies unimportant, but emphasises a range of other issues as equally crucial, including the broader socio-ecology and the various political factors that shape the system.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In Sweden, substance use problems are managed by both municipal social services and regional healthcare, and the Maria clinics are located within an intricate professional network comprising many agencies (eg, child welfare, child and adolescent psychiatry, law enforcement, the educational system), and are run by either regional healthcare, municipal social services, or both in collaboration. Given the Swedish prohibitionist approach to all illicit drugs, ASU treatment focuses on total abstinence. Abstinence is frequently assessed by urine tests,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> and these controlling elements are to be combined with efforts to build rapport with the patients to improve treatment outcomes. The provision of treatment at Maria clinics is indeed a dynamic, complex practice that hardly can be captured by any single methodological approach.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr32-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</sup> According to the widely influential Behavioural Model of Health Services Use,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup> healthcare utilisation is a function of a range of &#8220;predisposing&#8221; (eg, demographics, attitudes towards services) and &#8220;enabling&#8221; (eg, organisational) factors, as well as perceived and professionally assessed needs, including also feedback loops between different components of the model. Thus, while the current study provides a comprehensive take on the treatment at Sweden&#8217;s largest ASU provider, this only covers parts of the complex clinical practices and the factors that shape how the treatment is provided.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section8-29768357251351758"><title>Data and Methods</title><sec id="section9-29768357251351758"><title>Sample</title><p>The study uses data on all patients who had a registered contact with Maria Ungdom (MU) in the Stockholm (capital) region of Sweden during 2011 and 2021, including both outpatient and inpatient treatment (n&#8201;=&#8201;31&#8201;504). Some patients may have been in contact with MU in earlier periods but we do not have data on the extent to which this was the case. MU Stockholm is according to its homepage (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.mariaungdom.se/vara-mottagningar/hitta-mottagning" ext-link-type="uri">www.mariaungdom.se/vara-mottagningar/hitta-mottagning</ext-link>) currently organised as 27 treatment clinics (&#8220;mottagningar&#8221;) in the Stockholm region: an inpatient ward, a few larger central outpatient clinics, as well as several smaller, local clinics that may only be staffed a few days a week. The patients may come in contact with the clinics in a number of different ways. For example, they may be referred to outpatient treatment at MU by the social services, their school, child and adolescent psychiatry, by parental referral, or their first contact may be due to intoxication. All patients who first receive inpatient treatment are also offered outpatient treatment. Some patients were excluded from analyses because of apparent errors in the health records related to their birth dates. As most MU clinics cater to people from age 13 up to the age of 20, and some up to the age of 25, we excluded all patients who were recorded to be 26&#8201;years or older (n&#8201;=&#8201;1117) at first contact with MU. We also excluded all those who according to the case files were 12&#8201;years or younger at the first contact (n&#8201;=&#8201;416). A couple of individuals who had their first contact during 2010 were also removed (n&#8201;=&#8201;2) as they were too few to represent an entire cohort (ie, 2010). Otherwise, there were no exclusion criteria. This left a sample of 29&#8201;967 patients. Some information was only available for patients in outpatient treatment, so the number of patients vary in different parts of the Results section. No a priori power calculation was conducted for the following reasons: we utilised the full available sample; there was no single statistical contrast of greatest importance to guide effect size calculations; and the large sample size (even when broken into smaller subgroups) was believed to result in detectable differences of sufficient magnitude to be of scientific and clinical importance.</p><p>The time-frame in question (2011-2021) was chosen partly because this was a period of organisational stability for MU: the modern inpatient ward (which includes emergency care) was created in 2010 and one of the larger outpatient clinics was formed in 2011. Although there have been minor changes to the exact organisation of the smaller clinics during the period &#8211; some opening and some closing, within-municipality location changes etc. &#8211; the overall organisation has remained the same, as has the treatment uptake responsibility for the entirety of Region Stockholm. No major changes in the electronic health records system have occurred either. In terms of treatment provision, MU Stockholm has seen an increase in number of employed psychologists, with the aim of increasing the availability of psychological treatments and ADHD assessments. As a result of the implementation of structured healthcare process maps &#8211; a psychiatry-wide initiative in Region Stockholm &#8211; greater attention is now paid to psychiatric comorbidity, although the impact of this on uptake statistics remains to be examined. There has however been no major change in what types of treatment (eg, motivational interviewing, CBT etc.) are offered. While MU has remained a relatively stable point of reference in the local ASU landscape, child and adolescent psychiatry (a different organisational arm of regional healthcare) as well as municipal social services in Stockholm have faced well-known challenges during the period in question, including increasing demand for treatment, organisational changes, high staff turnover and more. Towards the end of the period covered, it was clarified in policy that isolated instances of substance use are not necessarily grounds for transfer from child and adolescent psychiatry to MU, although this is not yet implemented fully in practice. Moreover, social services in general are increasingly moving towards providing structured, evidence-based interventions, which imply that social services are now tasked with some of the treatment work previously carried out by MU Stockholm.</p></sec><sec id="section10-29768357251351758"><title>Variables</title><p>Variables were derived from raw electronic health records, systematically compiled using a structured database search query.

These variables were used as they were originally coded in the analyses.</p><p>We distinguished between 11&#8201;year <italic toggle="yes">cohorts</italic>, defined according to year of first contact with MU during the observed period. Patients having their first contact during 2011 were defined as being members of the 2011 cohort, those who had their first contact during 2012 were defined as being members of the 2012 cohort and so on. <italic toggle="yes">Patient age at first contact</italic> was calculated by subtracting patients&#8217; birth dates from the date of the first contact, rounded to full years. In the analyses we combined the age groups between 21 and 25&#8201;years to avoid problems with sparse data in some subgroups.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Sex</italic> (female/male) was derived from patients&#8217; personal number. As to <italic toggle="yes">treatment type</italic>, patients who had at least 1 visit to an outpatient MU clinic but who had never been admitted to inpatient treatment at MU were defined as being in <italic toggle="yes">outpatient treatment only</italic>.

Those who did not have any visits to outpatient treatment but at least 1 admission to inpatient care were defined as in <italic toggle="yes">inpatient treatment only</italic>. Of note, electronic health records covered only region-run ASU clinics in question; visits to social services (not involving MU Clinics), visits to corresponding clinics in other Swedish regions, or visits to private clinics, are not included. The data thus offer a complete view of care provided by the MU Clinics, but is not comprehensive in the sense that additional ASU treatment may, for some patients, have been offered by other actors.</p></sec><sec id="section11-29768357251351758"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Descriptive and multivariate techniques were used to analyse the data. Percent and mean values were used to summarise single variables. Negative binomial regressions were used in the multivariate analyses as the outcome variables had a larger variance than mean.</p><p>Two sets of regressions were run for outpatient visits and inpatient episodes, respectively. The first set estimated cohort and age trends overall and for subgroups defined by gender and treatment type. To allow for separate trends for subgroups, we included an interaction term between the specific subgroup variable and year cohort for respective age group. As very few patients in the 2019 to 2021 cohorts received inpatient treatment only, the analyses of inpatient episodes excluded these cohorts.</p><p>The second set of regressions adjusted for the fact that different cohorts (and age groups) had different potential exposure to treatment. The exposure was the entire period covered for those entering treatment in 2011 at a young age and only a few days for those entering at the end of 2021. There were large differences across cohorts in the days between first and last outpatient visit, ranging from 485.6&#8201;days on average for the 2011 cohort to 56.1&#8201;days for the 2021 cohort. Those who were at a younger age at first contact also had a longer time between first and last outpatient visit, ranging from 514.4&#8201;days on average among those who were 13&#8201;years at first contact to 210.9 among those who were 21 to 25&#8201;years. Cohorts differed in time in inpatient care as well: the 2011 cohort had an average of 130.5&#8201;days between the first episode and the last discharge and 2021 cohort had 10.95&#8201;days. The average number of days between first episode and last discharge was 205.3 among those who were 13&#8201;years at first contact and 9.72 among those who were 21 to 25&#8201;years.</p><p>To account for this, we included <italic toggle="yes">potential time-in-treatment</italic> as an offset variable in the regressions. This was calculated as the number of days between the first outpatient visit respective first inpatient episode at MU, and the last outpatient visit respective last discharge from inpatient treatment. In brief, offsetting a variable means first taking its natural logarithm and then constraining its coefficient in the regression model to 1.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr34-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</sup> As logarithms cannot be defined for zeros, we added a small constant (+0.5) to the 2 potential time-in-treatment variables before taking their logarithms so that also patients with only 1 outpatient treatment visit/inpatient episode (eg, 0&#8201;days between first and last outpatient visits) could be included. In contrast to the first set of regressions that estimate counts, these models estimate rates, that is, number of visits/episodes per time unit.<sup>

</sup> Results were presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR).</p><p>Statistical analyses were run in Stata vers. 17.0. Stata&#8217;s negbin command was used for the regression models. The margins command was used for predicting mean values in the first sets of analyses, and the marginsplot command was used to show these estimates graphically.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section12-29768357251351758"><title>Results</title><sec id="section13-29768357251351758"><title>Descriptive Statistics</title><p>Descriptive statistics are shown in <xref rid="table1-29768357251351758" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Opposite to the analyses that did not adjust for exposure time (<xref rid="fig2-29768357251351758" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), the rate of outpatient visits increased between age 13 at first contact to age 19, where the latter had a rate that was more than twice as high as the former.

<xref rid="bibr17-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> although the gender distribution converged somewhat in the last 2 cohorts. The most common treatment was outpatient only, which comprised about 75% of all patients. However, a larger share of males than females received outpatient treatment only (80% vs 67%) and the reverse held true for inpatient treatment only as well as both outpatient and inpatient treatment. Thus, female patients overall seemed to receive somewhat more comprehensive treatment. There were only marginal sex differences in the average age at first contact with MU, but females were more likely to enter treatment at 13&#8201;years or 14&#8201;years, whereas males were more likely to enter at the more typical age of 16 and 17&#8201;years. Females in ASU treatment overall have more extensive problems than males, including having both an earlier substance use debut<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> and more severe substance use problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> They have also a higher prevalence of mental health problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our findings of sex differences in type of treatment received may reflect such differences.</p><p>On average, patients in outpatient treatment had about 12 visits to a clinic, with no evident sex differences. However, there was a large variation in the number of outpatient visits and this was particularly evident among females. There was notable variation in number of inpatient episodes as well, and the variation was more apparent among females. These findings agree with prior studies showing that patients at Maria clinics are a highly heterogenous group.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Other research has also confirmed heterogeneity in substance use treatment trajectories among young patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup></p><p>We found differential trends for outpatient visits and inpatient episodes according to year cohort. The analyses that did not adjust for potential time in treatment showed a clear downward trend from about an average of 16 outpatient visits for the 2011 cohort to about 6 visits for the 2021 cohort. For inpatient care episodes, the results were less clear-cut. Even though the 2011 cohort received more inpatient episodes than the 2021 cohort, there were fluctuations across intermediate cohorts. We also identified disparate trends in treatment use for the different treatment types. The number of outpatient visits was relatively stable across cohorts among outpatients only, but it sharply declined among patients who also received inpatient treatment, and this seemed to drive the overall, downward trend in outpatient visits. The complex pattern in inpatient episodes across cohorts was also more obvious among patients who received both outpatient and inpatient treatment, while there were essentially no cohort differences among those in inpatient treatment only. This points to the importance of separating different treatment types in studies on adolescent treatment use, something that is not always done in smaller studies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, females in both outpatient and inpatient treatment had the most varying trend across year cohorts in the number of inpatient care episodes. This underscores that heterogeneity not only exists in relation to patient characteristics<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> or treatment trajectories,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> but also in relation to when different subgroups enter treatment.</p><p>When adjusting for differences in potential exposure time for treatment, the patterns in outpatient visits were reversed, with a higher outpatient visit rate for later year cohorts. Thus, per time unit, later cohorts had more visits, and this remained when adjusting for age at first contact and type of treatment. In the fully adjusted model, patients who had their first contact with MU during 2021 had an outpatient visit rate that was about 150% higher than patients who had their first contact during 2011. This apparent intensification of outpatient treatment among later cohorts is interesting and should be explored further. It is plausible that increased prevalence of cannabis, illegal in Sweden, as the primary drug at Maria clinics<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> may have intensified treatment delivery, but changes in the social-ecology surrounding treatment,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr31-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup> referrals from the social services and child and adolescent psychiatry and in clinical routines may also have played a role. For example, there may have been an increase in urine drug testing over time and the patient group may also have become more burdened in recent years. For example, prior estimates<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> suggest that a larger share of adolescents in contact with Maria clinics had prior or ongoing contact with psychiatric services during the latter part of the time period covered, suggesting that later cohorts may have more complex needs. At the same time, while cannabis over time has become more common as the primary substance, there has been a decline in the frequency of use of the primary substance and in risky alcohol consumption, and there seems to be no clear time trends in criminal offences (such as minor drug offence).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> The decline in alcohol use is also reflected in a downward trend in diagnoses for harmful use or dependence of alcohol among all Swedish patients in specialised, regional substance use treatment in Sweden during this period.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr36-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</sup> Likewise, national estimates suggest that there have been no obvious changes in the prevalence of cannabis and other illicit substance use among Swedish adolescents during the period covered, although there appears to have been a slight increase in the frequency of use among users.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr37-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</sup> Reflecting the trend across a number of countries, alcohol consumption has dropped substantially in the Swedish adolescent population during this period.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr37-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</sup></p><p>Thus, we find it unlikely that the differences across cohorts would be due only to different patient needs. Further research may take a deeper look into variations in clinical routines among ASU treatment providers over time for understanding temporal trends in treatment provision. Attending to the emergence and dynamics of organisational routines are crucial for understanding how organisations work,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr38-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</sup> and may give important clues to variations across time and patients in treatment. A strength of the current study, however, is that Maria Ungdom Stockholm has been around since the 1960s,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> with a relatively fixed role in an otherwise changing healthcare organisational landscape. The more notable changes at Maria Ungdom occurred before or during the first year of the period (the forming of the modern inpatient ward in 2010 and one of the larger outpatient clinics in 2011). Thus, the trends identified here are unlikely to be due to any profound within-organisational changes at Maria Ungdom Stockholm during the period.</p><p>For inpatient episodes, the analyses that adjusted for different exposure time among the year cohorts presented a less clear pattern than what was the case for outpatient visits. Although all subsequent year cohorts had a higher inpatient episode rate than the 2011 cohort, the pattern was not linear. The largest difference in inpatient episode rates was found between the 2015 cohort and the 2011 cohort, also in the fully adjusted model. It is difficult to know why there was only a clear trend for outpatient visits, but the large differences in inpatient episodes between the 2015 and the 2011 cohort may in part be due to the large inflow of immigrants during the 2015 &#8220;refugee crisis,&#8221; which resulted in an increase in the number of unaccompanied children being admitted to inpatient treatment. Of note, the number of inpatient episodes related to dependence or harmful illicit drug use also peaked in 2015 among all Swedish individuals in regional healthcare during this period, with the highest figures found for Stockholm.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr36-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</sup></p><p>The average age at first contact with MU was stable across cohorts; there was thus little to suggest that patients have become younger over time. Regarding age at first contact, the analyses that did not consider potential exposure time to treatment showed a clear decrease in the number of visits in age groups 13 to 19, which then increased again for age groups 20 and 21 to 25&#8201;years. This finding broadly agrees with a Norwegian study<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> showing that younger age is associated with more treatment use. This overall decrease over age groups, however, was mainly observed among males and among those in both outpatient and inpatient treatment.</p><p>There was also a lower number of inpatient episodes among those who were older at first contact. In this case as well, the trends differed according to treatment type. There was a negative association between age and number of inpatient episodes among patients in both inpatient and outpatient treatment, but there were essentially no differences between age at first contact among those in inpatient treatment only. Similar to outpatient visits, there were pronounced differences in number of inpatient episodes according to treatment type at lower ages at first contact (higher number of episodes among those in both outpatient and inpatient treatment), but this gap diminished substantially among those who were older at first contact.</p><p>When adjusting for potential exposure time to treatment, the association between age at first contact and number of outpatient visits changed direction. In these analyses, there was a positive association between age at first contact and number of outpatient visits in age groups 13 to 19; the rate was more than twice as high in those aged 19 at first contact compared to those who were 13&#8201;years old. A similar pattern emerged for number of inpatient episodes, where the difference between those who were 13&#8201;years at first contact and some older age groups were substantial. For example, those who were 19&#8201;years old at first contact had twice the rate of inpatient episodes compared to those who were 13&#8201;years old at first contact. Thus, whereas those who were older at first contact overall received less outpatient and inpatient treatment, they were provided more treatment per time unit.</p><sec id="section19-29768357251351758"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Some limitations should be noted. First, the data could potentially include systematic errors in recording,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr39-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
</sup> and there could potentially be variations in recording across staff and facilities<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-29768357251351758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> as well as over time. However, it is unlikely that staff would forget or neglect to record information about outpatient and inpatient treatment as such recording is a legal requirement in Sweden. Second, as our data do not include visits to social services (not involving municipal MU Clinics), to corresponding clinics in other regions in Sweden, or visits to private clinics, our study does not cover all treatment provided to adolescents. Third, we lack data on when each of the outpatient visits and impatient episodes occurred for those who had more than 1 visit/episode; the data only include information on the first and last outpatient visit/inpatient episodes and the total number of visits/episodes for each patient. As a consequence of this, our approach for adjusting for different potential exposure time to treatment was somewhat crude. Also, the study is limited to the Stockholm region which may differ in important respects from the specialised treatment provided in other parts of Sweden. From a complexity perspective, this is indeed to be expected.<sup>

</sup> The fact that the study only covered regional healthcare should be considered as well. No a priori power calculation is also a limitation.</p><p>Key strengths include total coverage of patients enrolled at Sweden&#8217;s largest provider of specialised ASU treatment. Employing objective measures of treatment use, we also did not face problems related to self-reports and non-response. The large sample allowed for separate analyses of outpatient and inpatient treatment, and for separate subgroups of patients. The longer time period should also be considered a strength, as much prior research covers only shorter time spans. Also, compared to many other studies assessing treatment use over time, the study relied on cohort data and not repeated cross-sectional surveys which have often been the case when assessing treatment use.<sup>

This study on patients at Sweden&#8217;s largest ASU clinic between 2011 and 2021 revealed that earlier cohorts and those who were younger at first contact received more outpatient treatment and the same pattern was found for age at first contact and inpatient treatment. The treatment rate was higher for both outpatient and inpatient treatment among later cohorts and patients who were at an older age at first contact, suggesting that these groups were provided with more intensive treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Patrik Karlsson <inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1177_29768357251351758-img1.jpg"/>
