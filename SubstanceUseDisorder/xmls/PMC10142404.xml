The hypothesized mechanism is related to insolubility of the drug, which promotes reuse, leading to contamination of injecting equipment. However, this relationship has not been confirmed. We aimed to conduct a systematic review including adult PWID exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone and the risk of acquiring IE, HCV, and HIV.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Evidence Based Medicine reviews from inception until September 2021. Following pilot testing, two reviewers conducted all screening of citations and full-text articles, as well as abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias using the Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa scale and Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Equity issues were examined using the PROGRESS-PLUS framework. Discrepancies were resolved consistently by a third reviewer. Meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity across the studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">After screening 3,231 citations from electronic databases, 722 citations from unpublished sources/reference scanning, and 626 full-text articles, five studies were included. Five were cohort studies, and one was a case&#8211;control study. The risk of bias varied across the studies. Two studies reported on gender, as well as other PROGRESS-PLUS criteria (race, housing, and employment). Three studies focused specifically on the controlled-release formulation of hydromorphone, whereas two studies focused on all formulations of hydromorphone. One retrospective cohort study found an association between controlled-release hydromorphone and IE, whereas a case&#8211;control study found no evidence of an association. One retrospective cohort study found an association between the number of hydromorphone controlled-release prescriptions and prevalence of HCV. None of the studies specifically reported on associations with HIV.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Very few studies have examined the risk of IE, HCV, and HIV infection after exposure to controlled-release hydromorphone. Very low-quality and scant evidence suggests uncertainty around the risks of blood-borne infections, such as HCV and IE to PWID using this medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary

opioid recommended as second-line therapy for mild-to-moderate non-malignant pain and first-line therapy for severe non-malignant pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hydromorphone is also a pain relief treatment option for cancer-related pain in the World Health Organization (WHO) updated guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hydromorphone&#160;is available as immediate- and controlled-release formulations, and can be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, through epidural or intrathecal, and intramuscularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the WHO has set the target to reduce HCV prevalence up to 90% by 2035. There has also been a marked increase in infective endocarditis (IE) amongst PWID over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These trends have mirrored the growing opioid crisis in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">It has been suggested that the increasing availability of controlled-release formulation of hydromorphone might be associated with contributing to higher rates of these infections HCV, IE, and HIV due to contamination and reuse of injection drug preparation equipment (IDPE). Some authors have hypothesized that injection of controlled-release hydromorphone elevates the risk of blood-borne infections through multiple mechanism. First, controlled-release hydromorphone does not readily dissolve in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], leading to more frequent injections; injection risk will increase if injections are performed under non-sterile conditions. Second, because controlled-release hydromorphone is insoluble, it leaves behind a residue that may be kept for reuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and/or shared with others. Bacterial or viral contamination of the residue or the equipment that stores the residue (i.e. the &#8220;cooker&#8221;) could contribute to the risk of blood-borne infection, even without sharing of needles or syringes. Third, laboratory data indicate that excipients within controlled-release hydromorphone may promote viral survival and infectiousness. However, the hypothesized association between injection of controlled-release hydromorphone and HCV, IE, and HIV infection amongst PWID has not been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">As such, we conducted a systematic review to examine the risk of IE, HCV, or HIV in individuals exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone compared with other opioids, as well as to determine the characteristics of individuals exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone experiencing these infections. Our specific research questions were: (1) &#8220;What are the rates of IE, HCV infection, and/or HIV infection in adults exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone compared with the rates of the same infections in people using immediate-release (oral) hydromorphone, injectable hydromorphone, and other controlled-release products globally?&#8221; and (2) &#8220;What are the characteristics of adults exposed to controlled-release hydromorphone who experienced IE, HCV infection and/or HIV infection, including previous treatment or hospitalization for opioid-related harms?&#8221;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protocol</title><p id="Par19">We were commissioned by Health Canada to conduct this systematic review through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A preliminary review was conducted by Health Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which formed the basis for this systematic review. Health Canada was consulted at every stage of the systematic review process.

Only five relevant studies were identified, which indicates a lack of evidence in this area. Although some studies demonstrated a potential association between the use of controlled-release hydromorphone and HCV, IE, and HIV incidence, all but two studies were based on retrospective data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One retrospective study did not find an association with IE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As well, two studies focused on hydromorphone overall and not the controlled-release formulation, which makes interpretation difficult. None of the studies specifically reported on associations with HIV.</p><p id="Par40">Injection risks with controlled-release hydromorphone may be related to sharing of IDPE, which suggests interventions that could decrease this harm. The process for preparing HCR for injection involves removing the substance from the capsule, crushing it in a metal cooker, and adding sterile water. One study suggested that heating controlled-release hydromorphone prior to injection may decrease the risk of IE. Another found that the use of a particular cooker (the Stericup) may be protective against IE.</p><p id="Par41">Our systematic review identified several gaps in the literature. All studies were conducted in Canada, indicating a gap in the literature from other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, as well as in countries with high opioid usage, such as the USA. Furthermore, only two studies reported on the PROGRESS-PLUS criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which can be used to examine equity issues in research. Future research in this area should report on all the PROGRESS-PLUS criteria so that targeted interventions can be developed to address social determinants of health at the same time as addressing harm reduction.</p><p id="Par42">There are limitations to our systematic review that are worth noting. One is the lack of available evidence on this topic, which limits our interpretation of results. We also excluded adolescents from our review and use of controlled-release hydromorphone might occur in this population. Due to the limited evidence in this area, we were more liberal in our inclusion of studies compared with our registered protocol and included studies examining hydromorphone overall and not focused on the controlled-release formulation. We were also unable to conduct GRADE assessments for certainty of evidence. These are deviations from our protocol.&#160;Another limitation is the risk of bias of the included studies; particularly regarding the lack of controlling for confounding across the studies. The strengths of our systematic review included following the methodologically rigorous Cochrane handbook and the PRISMA 2020 reporting guidance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">Very few studies have examined the risk of IE, HCV, and HIV infection after exposure to controlled-release hydromorphone. Very low-quality and scant evidence suggests uncertainty around the risks of blood-borne infections, such as HCV and IE to PWID using this medication.
