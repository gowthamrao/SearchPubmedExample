We examined readmissions rates, diagnoses at readmission, and risk factors associated with readmission following acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in a large United States (US) administrative database. Using the 2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified adults discharged with AIS (ICD-10-CM I63*) as the principal diagnosis. Survival analysis with Weibull accelerated failure time regression was used to examine variables associated with hospital readmission. In 2019, 273,811 of 285,451 AIS patients survived their initial hospitalization. Of these, 60,831 (22.2%) were readmitted within 2019. Based on Kaplan Meyer analysis, readmission rates were 9.7% within 30 days and 30.5% at 1 year following initial discharge. The most common causes of readmissions were stroke and post stroke sequalae (25.4% of 30-day readmissions, 15.0% of readmissions between 30&#8211;364 days), followed by sepsis (10.3% of 30-day readmissions, 9.4% of readmissions between 30&#8211;364 days), and acute renal failure (3.2% of 30-day readmissions, 3.0% of readmissions between 30&#8211;364 days). After adjusting for multiple patient and hospital-level characteristics, patients at increased risk of readmission were older (71.6 vs. 69.8 years, p&lt;0.001) and had longer initial lengths of stay (7.6 vs. 6.2 day, p&lt;0.001). They more often had modifiable comorbidities, including vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation), depression, epilepsy, and drug abuse. Social determinants associated with increased readmission included living in an urban (vs. rural) setting, living in zip-codes with the lowest median income, and having Medicare insurance. All factors were significant at p&lt;0.001. Unplanned hospital readmissions following AIS were high, with the most common reasons for readmission being recurrent stroke and post stroke sequalae, followed by sepsis and acute renal failure. These findings suggest that efforts to reduce readmissions should focus on optimizing secondary stroke and infection prevention, particularly among older socially disadvantaged patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CIHR</institution></funding-source><award-id>RN387091 - 420683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3064-0864</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Lily W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>NIH-NINDS</institution></funding-source><award-id>K23NS105924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>de Havenon</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>LWZ received salary support from a project grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (RN387091 - 420683).

Hospital readmission following AIS has previously been estimated to occur in 17.4% of patients at 30 days and 42.5% of patients at 1 year [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The total direct medical cost of stroke is among the top 10 contributors to Medicare expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and is projected to more than double from $71.55 billion to $184.13 billion between the years of 2012&#8211;2035 [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, each additional day spend in health care facilities (vs. home) in the 3 months following stroke has been associated with decreased quality of life in addition to increased healthcare costs [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Measuring and reducing readmissions is a vital component in improving quality of life after stroke and in managing the staggering growth in stroke-related healthcare expenditure.</p><p>To better understand the frequency and the causes of readmission after AIS, we report the rates of readmission by patient-level medical comorbidities, stroke severity, discharge status and socioeconomic status from the 2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), which contains 18 million discharges representing 60.4% of all U.S. hospitalizations from 30 states and from all types of insurance payers [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The NRD does not allow data linkage across calendar years for the same patient resulting in variable length of follow up for patients admitted in different times of the year. Because of this, previous work using the NRD studied 30-day readmissions following stroke [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289640.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We describe a novel technique using time-to-event (ie the product limit method) which 1) provides readmission rates using Kaplan-Meyer estimates including survival time contributions from right-censored patients at 30-days and 1-year following hospital discharge, 2) allows data from all patients in the sample to contribute to the estimates (including patients with less than 30-days follow-up), and 3) allows examination of risk factors for readmission using survival analysis.&#8221;</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cohort, outcomes, and co-variates</title><p>We included individuals with AIS (ICD-10-CM I63*) as the principal discharge diagnosis of their baseline hospital admission and excluded patients under age 18 and elective hospital admissions. The primary outcome was any non-elective hospital readmission during 2019. The secondary outcome was readmission with 1) recurrent AIS (ICD 10 codes I63*) as the principal readmission diagnosis. The tertiary outcome was readmission due to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) defined as: 1) AIS, 2) transient ischemic attack (TIA) (G45*, G46*), 3) Peripheral Vascular Disease (I7*), 4) myocardial infarction (MI) (I21*, I22*) or 5) cardiac arrest (I46*) as the principal readmission diagnosis or 6) a hospital readmission ending in death with a principal readmission diagnosis starting with I (diseases of the circulatory system) to capture cardiovascular death.</p><p>The study exposures of individual-level medical comorbidities were pre-defined by NRD, which uses the Elixhauser Comorbidity Measure [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with the exception of the following comorbidities (defined by ICD-10-CM coding): atrial fibrillation (AF) (I48*), smoking/nicotine dependence (I17*), hyperlipidemia (E78.1-E78.5), and epilepsy (G40*). Because our study used de-identified data, it was exempt from IRB approval. The data is publicly available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov</ext-link>. We report our findings according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the primary analysis, we fit time-to-event models. For individuals with the primary outcome of hospital readmission, the exact number of days between the index admission and the readmission is captured in the NRD. Time to readmission is calculated using this information and length of stay (LOS) of the index admission. Within the NRD, hospital records from patient transfers are combined to avoid counting hospitalization at the second hospital as a readmission. For those without recurrence, NRD only captures the month of discharge. Because the resulting timescale mix of days and months would prevent an accurate time to event model, we imputed the discharge day of index admission for those without the primary outcome. The imputation selected a random discharge day in the discharge month and creates a timescale in days for individuals without a second hospitalization. This novel methodology reduces bias by allowing the right-censoring to assume a standard distribution.</p><p>Stratified Cox models were initially used to assess variables associated with readmission but there were significant violations of the proportional hazards assumption. This was confirmed graphically on plots of Schoenfeld residuals and log-log plots of survival (<xref rid="pone.0289640.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Because of this, we used Weibull accelerated failure time regression models for survival analysis, which does not assume constant hazard in survival data [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], to examine the association between patient characteristics (demographics, socio-economic variables, comorbidities) and time to hospital readmission.</p><p>This was done first in univariate analysis and then after adjusting for patient age, sex, LOS, discharge disposition, hospital bed size using National Inpatient Sample criteria (small/medium/large) [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], location/teaching status (urban teaching, urban non-teaching, rural), and ownership (government, private non-profit, private for-profit), and baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), made available after October of 2016 by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (using ICD-10-CM code (R29.7*) to be used in conjunction with the diagnosis of AIS (I63*). Admission NIHSS scores are submitted from the admitting hospital&#8217;s medical record to the National Readmission Database as a component of administrative data [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Adjustment for stroke severity using NIHSS submitted in this form to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project has previously been shown to have important implications in analysis of the association between poststroke outcome and patient sex or stroke interventions [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Baseline NIHSS and LOS were stratified into categories as there was significant non-linearity on the Box-Tidwell test. The Box-Tidwell test was not significant for age, so it was included in the multivariable model as a continuous variable. The study exposures measured at the index admission included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, AF, obesity, drug abuse, smoking or nicotine dependence, depression, dementia, epilepsy, malignancy, rural residence, median income by zip code, primary payer.</p><p>Principal diagnoses at readmission were divided into categories using the ICD-10-CM code first letter, which corresponds to organ system.

We found multiple patient-level factors that are associated with increased hospital readmission including vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, AF), drug abuse, epilepsy, depression, dementia and malignancy as well social determinants (insurance status, residing in urban areas and zip codes with low median income).</p><p>Hospital readmission within 30 days has been defined by the centers of Medicare and Medicaid services as an indicator of poor inpatient care and has been linked to payment determination via the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our results show that in 2019, rates of all cause 30-day readmissions for patients with AIS was 9.7%. Previously, authors studying the 2010&#8211;2015 NRD [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported an all-cause 30-day readmission rate of 12% with a decreasing trend during the study period consistent with our lower point estimate. Other US estimates vary widely between 6.4% [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] from a large single center cohort up to 21% using 2008 national Medicare claims data [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differences in rates of readmissions by insurance status (with higher readmissions among those insured with Medicare) and by hospital characteristics, as shown in our analyses, likely explain some of the discrepancies between studies.</p><p>Causes for hospital readmissions are complex and may be due to failure to plan for post stroke needs and to implement appropriate stroke prevention, the development of a post-stroke sequelae, or new issues separate from the patient&#8217;s initial stroke. In our study, more than 50% of all 30-day readmissions could be attributed to ten causes. Ischemic stroke or post stroke sequelae accounted for 25% of readmissions with a further 1.8% of readmissions from hemorrhagic stroke, a proportion of which may represent hemorrhagic transformation. The next most common cause of readmission was from infections, which accounted for 10.3% of readmissions at 30 days, followed by acute renal failure, MI and complications of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and AF. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 7 US, 2 Chinese and 1 Norwegian studies of hospital readmission within 30 days after stroke, the most common causes for readmission were infection (19.9%), coronary artery disease (17.8%) and recurrent stroke (16.0%) respectively [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our findings and other prior research suggest that the highest yield interventions in transitional care after stroke hospitalization would likely include improved infection prevention strategies at discharge and careful transition of responsibility for vascular risk factor management from the inpatient to outpatient settings [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Causes for more adverse outcomes following stroke in women compared to men have previously been described and include older age and more severe strokes [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found that the higher rate of all cause readmission in women was no longer significant after controlling for stroke severity, age, and hospital characteristics, suggesting that a sex-based difference is likely confounded.</p><p>All cause readmission as well as readmission for AIS and MACE was higher amongst patients living in zip codes with the lowest quartile of median income and for patients treated in urban hospitals. Higher 30-day readmissions at &#8220;safety net hospitals&#8221; located in poor and underserved communities has previously been noted when examining multiple HRRP targeted conditions within the US [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These findings highlight persistent health disparities in stroke care and aftercare, which are challenging to address on a policy level. Safety-net hospitals treating vulnerable patients have suffered disproportionally higher penalties under HRRP [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, adjusting penalties based on the income of treated patients may unintentionally entrench lower standards for care provided to disadvantaged populations [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>When examining only readmissions due to AIS or MACE, readmitted patients appear paradoxically healthier (younger age, less severe baseline strokes, shorter initial LOS and lower rates of AF and dementia) compared to those not readmitted. This effect was not seen when looking at all cause readmissions and may be explained by the fact that patients readmitted for AIS have fewer co-morbidities that could take coding preference during the readmission compared to patients readmitted for other causes [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings should not be taken to suggest higher stroke recurrence in younger patients or those without AF but rather that younger and healthier patients have less complicated readmissions where stroke recurrence or stroke complications are more likely to be the principal diagnosis.</p><p>Our study has limitations. Firstly, the NRD does not allow for linkage of admissions across multiple years or admissions of the same patient occurring across multiple states. We used a novel approach to modelling recurrent ischemic stroke admission in the US using time-to-event analysis, which accurately models the time to right-censoring allowing us to make use of all available data unlike previous works using NRD data that focused solely on risk factors related to 30 days readmissions. However, the data structure still limits the duration of follow up and makes it challenging to study preceding admissions. Our current study examines patients following their first admission with AIS in 2019 but we were unable to differentiate between first ever stroke vs. recurrent stroke admissions in patients with stroke admissions before 2019.</p><p>Secondly, for readmissions due to AIS (ICD code I63*), which accounts for more than 20% of readmissions before 30 days, there is no reliable way of differentiating between incident new AIS vs. readmission due to the index event for psycho-social reasons or recrudescence of symptoms. Among AIS readmissions with a documented NIHSS, the NIHSS on readmission is slightly higher compared to the index admission (6.7 vs. 5.9) suggesting worsening of neurological function and the validity of a recurrent stroke diagnosis. Similarly, there has been no validated methods of examining for hemorrhagic transformation during AIS admissions so the effect of this important prognostic factor could not be analyzed.</p><p>We found hospital readmission from MACE occurred in 2.6% of patients at 30 days and in 7.6% of patients at 1 year after discharge. Within MACE, readmissions due to AIS occurred in 2.2% and 5.8% of patients at 30 days and 1 year respectively. Rates of recurrent stroke vary significantly based on stroke etiology. Within the POINT study, of patients with minor stroke and high-risk TIA, the recurrence of ischemic stroke, MI, or ischemic vascular death occurred in 4.9% of patients at 30 days [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In THALES, the rate of ischemic stroke at 30 days was 5.6%. Annual stroke recurrence rates reported from clinical trials vary from 2.4%, as seen in the SPS3 trial [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] of patients with lacunar infarction, up to 15%, seen in the WASID [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and SAMMPRIS [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] trials of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Rates of recurrent stroke within 5 years after first stroke also varies significantly by age, sex and ethnicity ranging from 5% in black men under 65 years old to 22% in black women aged 65&#8211;74 [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, the NRD does not contain data on race/ethnicity to examine for differences within these subgroups.</p><p>Additionally, there is no way of linking anonymized NRD data to other data sources to obtain information on out-of-hospital mortality. In our study, patients with very high NIHSS at their baseline admissions had lower rehospitalization rates which was likely due to increased rates of out of hospital death following discharge. Out of hospital deaths can account for up to 78% of deaths after stroke at 30 days and 49% of deaths at 1 year [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Out of hospital death information would have also enabled competing risk analyses [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and for a more accurate description of cardiovascular death in the MACE composite. Finally, the cohort being studied was identified using ICD diagnosis codes which is subject to human error during the coding process. However, previous work shows that codes for both AIS and AIS risk factors have acceptable accuracy in administrative data for hospitalized patients [<xref rid="pone.0289640.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unplanned readmission to US hospitals following AIS was high in 2019, with 9.7% of patients being readmitted within 30 days of discharge and 30.5% readmitted by 1 year.

Our findings also highlight significant continued health disparities by social determinants of health with higher readmissions among those living in zip-codes with the lowest median income, those living in urban settings and those with Medicare insurance.</p></sec><sec id="sec011" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0289640.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Example diagnostic plots showing violations of assumption of proportional hazards for hypertension with top panel showing non-parallel lines on log-log plot of survival and bottom panel showing increasing scaled Schoenfeld residuals over time (more prominent in early period).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0289640.s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0289640.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Principle diagnosis at readmission after discharge with ischemic stroke by ICD category.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0289640.s002.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Data Partners that contributed to the data made available for analysis.

It would be interesting to see the trends thereafter from 2016-2020, whether there was any impact of COVID-19 infection on readmission post stroke.

</p><p>2.Can the authors include the number of patients who had hemorrhagic conversion following AIS during the index stay?</p><p>3.The NRD does not track patients beyond the calendar year. For example, patients admitted in December 2019 cannot be tracked for 30-day readmission as there is no link between the year 2019 and 2020. Therefore, December month admissions should be excluded because the 30-day readmission rate cannot be calculated. Many studies have been published using the same methodology. The authors should clarify if they have excluded December month admissions and add it to the limitations.</p><p>4.The NRD provides information regarding inter-hospital transfers. If a patient was admitted to a small hospital and transferred to a large hospital, there is a small chance that the patient might be included twice. Therefore, inter-hospital transfers must be excluded. If the authors have excluded them, please clarify in the methods section.

</p><p>The authors of the present study does not have any special access privileges in accessing this publicly available dataset which other interested researchers would not have. Similarly, we do not have additional information on methodology beyond what is publicly available on the HCUP website: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nrdoverview.jsp" ext-link-type="uri">https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nrdoverview.jsp</ext-link>. Please see below: </p><p>"The Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NRD is a unique and powerful database designed to support various types of analyses of national readmissions for all patients, regardless of the expected payer for the hospital stay. This database addresses a large gap in healthcare data - the lack of nationally representative information on hospital readmissions for all ages. Unweighted, the 2020 NRD contains data from approximately 17 million discharges. Weighted, it estimates roughly 32 million discharges. Developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), HCUP data inform decision making at the national, State, and community levels."</p><p>With regards to data sharing, the data used is publicly available administrative data. It can be purchased for use by researchers after appropriate safety and confidentiality training from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. We are unable to upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate the study findings. As a condition of access within the data use agreement, authors agreed that &#8220;I will not redistribute HCUP data by posting on any website or publishing in any other publicly accessible online repository. If a journal or publication requests access to data or analytic files, I will cite restrictions on data sharing in this Data Use Agreement and direct them to AHRQ HCUP (www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov) for more information on accessing HCUP data.&#8221;</p><p>Many thanks to the editor and reviewers for comments to strengthen our paper. We&#8217;ve responded to the Reviewer&#8217;s Comments below and revised the manuscript with changes below. </p><p>Reviewer #1: 1. In methods section, this sentence needs to be corrected: "Secondary outcomes included readmission with 1) recurrent AIS (ICD 10 codes I63*) as the principal discharge diagnosis, and 2) readmissions due to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) defined as: 1) AIS, 2) transient</p><p>ischemic attack (TIA) (G45*, G46*), 3) Peripheral Vascular Disease (I7*), 4) myocardial infarction (MI) (I21*, I22*) or 5) cardiac arrest (I46*) as the principal discharge diagnosis or 6) a hospital readmission ending in death with a principal discharge diagnosis starting with I (diseases of the circulatory system) to capture cardiovascular death". It is not readmission outcome with discharge diagnosis, rather it is readmission outcome with principal readmission diagnosis. Also correct in abstract and in other parts of manuscript.</p><p>Thank you for this recommendation for clarification. The manuscript now reads: </p><p>The secondary outcome was readmission due to recurrent AIS (ICD 10 codes I63*) as the principal readmission diagnosis. The tertiary outcome was readmission due to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) defined as: 1) AIS, 2) transient ischemic attack (TIA) (G45*, G46*), 3) Peripheral Vascular Disease (I7*), 4) myocardial infarction (MI) (I21*, I22*) or 5) cardiac arrest (I46*) as the principal readmission diagnosis or 6) a hospital readmission ending in death with a principal readmission diagnosis starting with I (diseases of the circulatory system) to capture cardiovascular death. </p><p>Similar terminology does not appear in the abstract or in other locations of the manuscript. </p><p>2. Authors should explain in detail how they got NIHSS scale in methodology.</p><p>The NIHSS scores are submitted from admitting hospitals to the National Readmission Database as a component of administrative data and are extracted from patient records. The following has been added to the methods for clarification. </p><p>&#8220;&#8230;. baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), made available after October of 2016 by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (using ICD-10-CM code (R29.7*) to be used in conjunction with the diagnosis of AIS (I63*). Admission NIHSS scores are submitted from the admitting hospital&#8217;s medical record to the National Readmission Database as a component of administrative data.[12] Adjustment for stroke severity using NIHSS submitted in this form to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project has previously been shown to have important implications in analysis of the association between poststroke outcome and patient sex or stroke interventions.[13]"</p><p>3. In Abstract, please mention the cut off for age (older) and LOS.</p><p>Based on this comment we realized that our writing was unclear and suggested that we used cutoffs, which is not the case. Instead, we meant to report differences in means. We have tried to clarify this in the revised abstract which now reads: &#8220;&#8230;.patients at increased risk of readmission were older (71.6 vs. 69.8 years, p&lt;0.001) and had longer initial lengths of stay (7.6 vs. 6.2 days, p&lt;0.001).&#8221;</p><p>4. In Abstract, please mention the comparison groups of social determinants of health.</p><p>This abstract now reads: &#8220;Social determinants associated with increased readmission included living in an urban (vs. rural) setting, living in zip-codes with the lowest median income, and having Medicare insurance.&#8221; These are the main three social determinants. Other insurance status groups (Medicaid, private, self-pay or other) are listed in the main text but not included in the abstract due to word count limitations (300 words max).</p><p>The abstract has been revised in other locations to make room within the word limitations for these additions. </p><p>5. ICD coding errors are major limitations of National databases, and it should be mentioned in the limitations section.</p><p>This has been acknowledged with the following in the discussion: &#8220;Finally, the cohort being studied was identified using ICD diagnosis codes which is subject to human error during the coding process. However, previous work shows that codes for both AIS and AIS risk factors have acceptable accuracy in administrative data for hospitalized patients.[32]" </p><p>6. Authors should mention the missing data in Figure-1.</p><p>There is no missing data for Figure 1 as all patients had complete information on death at discharge and all other diagnostic information is coded only when present. This has been clarified at the bottom of the figure. </p><p> &#8220;a There is no missing data on mortality at discharge within this cohort&#8221;</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript is well written and highlights one major reasons for hospital readmission. A few ideas to include in the outcomes includes, the cost of readmission. </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to improve this manuscript. The following has been added to our manuscript: </p><p>Of the 285,451 initial stroke hospitalizations in the 2019 NRD (median LOS 3 days, IQR 3-7 days; median hospitalization charge $48 504 USD, IQR $27 226-91 089 USD), 4.1% resulted in mortality (Fig 1). Of the 273,811 patients who survived their initial hospitalization, 22.2% were readmitted to hospital within 2019 (median LOS 4 days, IQR 2-7; median hospitalization charge $40 105, IQR $22 115- 76 600 USD).</p><p>Previous studies have been done on national readmission database have compared the trends over time from 2010-2025. It would be interesting to see the trends thereafter from 2016-2020, whether there was any impact of COVID-19 infection on readmission post stroke.</p><p>We agree these are important elements to consider in our analysis. However, we exclusively analyzed the 2019 National Readmission Data (NRD) for this manuscript so are unable to conduct a temporal trend analysis. Additionally, information from COVID cannot be captured with 2019 NRD data (as the code for COVID, U071, was introduced in HCUP data starting in 2020). </p><p>Lastly, the tables needs to be accurately labelled and missing values needs to be updated. They can cut short the tables to include the variables relevant to the study.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The table labels have been checked for accuracy and missing data. Within table 2, the number of missing values has been added for all variables where there were missing values. We have provided a statement in the table&#8217;s footnote that &#8216;Data are complete for all variables where no missing data are reported.&#8217;</p><p>Reviewer #3: Overall, this peer-reviewed article provides valuable insights into the rates, causes, and risk factors associated with hospital readmissions following acute ischemic stroke in the United States. The reviewer has following concerns:</p><p>1.Multiple studies have been published on the 30-day readmission rate following acute ischemic stroke using the same database.

</p><p>Thank you for these additional resources. They have been added to our introduction as references 7 and 8. The main difference with the prior studies is that we were able to look at 1-year readmission rates. We have further clarified this difference within our introduction: &#8220;The NRD does not allow data linkage across calendar years for the same patient resulting in variable length of follow up for patients admitted in different times of the year. Because of this, previous work using the NRD studied 30-day readmissions following stroke. [7-8] We describe a novel technique using time-to-event (ie the product limit method) which 1) provides readmission rates using Kaplan-Meyer estimates including survival time contributions from right-censored patients at 30-days and 1-year following hospital discharge, 2) allows data from all patients in the sample to contribute to the estimates (including patients with less than 30-days follow-up), and 3) allows examination of risk factors for readmission using survival analysis.&#8221; </p><p>We agree that temporal trends in readmission would be of interest, but this manuscript analyzed the 2019 National Readmission Database exclusively and does not have sufficient information for temporal trend analysis. </p><p>2.Can the authors include the number of patients who had hemorrhagic conversion following AIS during the index stay?</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that hemorrhagic transformation is an important prognostic predictor in stroke and would be of interest with regards to readmission. </p><p>However, there has been no validated methods for capturing hemorrhagic transformation following acute ischemic stroke within administrative data. One approach is the use of ICD 10 codes for intra-cranial hemorrhage codes and DRG codes related to complications of thrombolysis (61-63). From our experience working with NRD data, this approach leads to rates of hemorrhagic transformation which are not clinically intuitive (such as a hemorrhagic transformation rate of ~10% in AIS following thrombolysis). </p><p>This might, in part, be because patients who had both a primary intra-cranial hemorrhage and an ischemic stroke within the same admission would be miscoded as &#8216;hemorrhagic transformation&#8217; using this strategy. Because of these concerns, information on hemorrhagic transformation was not included. We have included a statement to the discussion to describe this: &#8220;Similarly, there has been no validated methods of examining for hemorrhagic transformation during AIS admissions so the effect of this important prognostic factor could not be analyzed.&#8221;</p><p>3.The NRD does not track patients beyond the calendar year. For example, patients admitted in December 2019 cannot be tracked for 30-day readmission as there is no link between the year 2019 and 2020. Therefore, December month admissions should be excluded because the 30-day readmission rate cannot be calculated. Many studies have been published using the same methodology. The authors should clarify if they have excluded December month admissions and add it to the limitations.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion for clarification. This is an important limitation of using the NRD using a conventional approach, and why we opted for a survival analysis approach which allows for better use of NRD data compared to previous analysis for stroke readmissions. In our analyses, using Kaplan-Meyer estimates (i.e. the product limit method), patients from December contributed to the 30 days (and 1-year) readmission rate as censored data. In our response to your first comment above, we have detailed how we have modified the introduction to better describe the benefits of using a Kaplan Meyer approach. </p><p>4.The NRD provides information regarding inter-hospital transfers. If a patient was admitted to a small hospital and transferred to a large hospital, there is a small chance that the patient might be included twice. Therefore, inter-hospital transfers must be excluded. If the authors have excluded them, please clarify in the methods section. If they have not excluded them, please provide a reason for not doing so.</p><p>This is a valid concern addressed in the NRD data structure by HCUP. &#8220;Readmission analyses do not usually allow the hospitalization at the receiving hospital to be counted as a readmission. To eliminate this possibility, pairs of records representing a transfer are collapsed into a single "combined" record in the NRD.&#8221; Further information is available from the HCUP website: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/vars/samedayevent/nrdnote.jsp" ext-link-type="uri">https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/vars/samedayevent/nrdnote.jsp</ext-link></p><p>We have added a brief statement to the methods to describe this: &#8220;Within the NRD, hospital records from patient transfers are combined to avoid counting hospitalization at the second hospital as a readmission.&#8221;</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0289640.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">16June FINAL Responses to reviewer comments.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0289640.s003.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0289640.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0289640.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Gangu</surname><given-names initials="K">Karthik</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Karthik Gangu</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Karthik Gangu</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0289640"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
