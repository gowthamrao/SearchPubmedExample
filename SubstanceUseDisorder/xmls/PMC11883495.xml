Event studies were conducted to estimate the magnitude of the association for each year-quarter relative to the time of each policy implementation. This study was conducted among all adults aged 18 to 64 years enrolled in the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, a database of employer-sponsored health insurance enrollees, with 1 year or more of continuous enrollment from 2011 to 2021.

No significant associations were observed for MCDs or HC-MC. Relative increases in CUD associated with MCLs were higher among female enrollees and among enrollees aged 35 to 44 years compared with male enrollees and other age groups, respectively. Sensitivity analysis results of 2011 to 2019 data were consistent with the 2011 to 2021 results.</p></sec><sec id="ab-yoi240082-10"><title>Conclusions and Relevance</title><p>In this longitudinal cohort study, MCLs were associated with increased CUD and cannabis poisoning diagnoses, and RCLs were associated with increased cannabis poisoning in adults aged 18 to 64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance. Communities with increased access to cannabis may experience increased health care use and costs due to increases in cannabis poisoning and CUD, and new clinical and policy interventions are needed to curb these rising diagnoses.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" specific-use="electronic"><p>This longitudinal cohort study examines state-level medical and recreational cannabis laws&#8217; association with cannabis use disorder and cannabis poisoning, overall and by sex and age subgroups, among US adults with employer-sponsored health insurance from 2011 to 2021.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-exception-type</meta-name><meta-value>EMBARGO</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article></pmc-articleset>
