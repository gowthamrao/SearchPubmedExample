However, prior studies have used institution-specific educational materials and varied widely in their delivery of patient education.</p><p id="p0015">In 2018, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) integrated the best practices and evidence from the literature and developed the Safe and Effective Pain Control After Surgery (SEPCAS) patient education brochure as part of their Strong for Surgery initiative [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Strong for Surgery initiative is a bundle of checklists and patient education materials to improve surgical outcomes. The SEPCAS brochure provides patients with recommendations for pain management strategies, the use of non-opioid and opioid medications, and important information on the safe storage and disposal of opioids.</p><p id="p0020">At our institution, a prior study identified three gaps in our existing patient education process: pre-operative expectation setting around post-operative pain, strategies for managing post-operative pain (including the use of opioid medications), and the importance of appropriate opioid disposal [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The object of the current study was to implement a quality improvement intervention using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) methodology to target these gaps.

Our intervention consisted of the following components: 1) preoperative verbal education delivered by nurses in clinic and structured around the SEPCAS brochure in addition to providing patients with the physical brochure, 2) postoperative, pre-discharge verbal counseling by discharge pharmacists using the SEPCAS brochure to reinforce key concepts. Verbal educational materials (<xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix 2</xref>) were based on the ACS Strong for Surgery Safe and Effective Pain Control Screening Checklist.

All English-speaking, adult patients (age&#160;&#8805;&#160;18) undergoing major abdominal surgery (defined as an operation involving the surgical entrance of the abdominal cavity with a hospital stay of at least 24&#160;h) were eligible for inclusion. Patients who required interpreter services or who were admitted directly to the hospital without a pre-operative clinic visit (e.g., through the emergency department) were excluded from this study. The study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB_00133785). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Implementation personnel</title><p id="p0050">A total of nine surgeons (four colorectal, two surgical oncologists, and three general surgeons) performed the operations on the patients involved in this study. At each of the two clinic locations, there was one nurse lead who performed the majority of the nurse-directed pre-operative education and survey distribution who was assisted by 1&#8211;2 other nurses at each location. The pharmacist-led education at hospital discharge was performed by the two clinical pharmacists listed as authors in this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Evaluation tools</title><p id="p0055">To evaluate our intervention, we developed a paper-based survey to be administered to patients in the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. The survey asked all patients about their expectations about surgery and their post-operative recovery, satisfaction with pain management, pain scores, and clinical history of comorbidities associated with opioids and pain (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix 3</xref>). The survey was based on questions asked in the ACS SEPCAS brochure &#8220;Safe Pain Control Patient Evaluation&#8221; and patients provided answers on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (&#8220;A lot less&#8221;) to 7 (&#8220;A lot more&#8221;) with the neutral option number 4 in the middle being &#8220;No more or less&#8221; [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We further refined the questions using iterative pilot-testing with surgeons, nurses, staff, and patients. Pain scores were measured using the Revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) which asks, &#8220;How often were you in severe pain during the first week after surgery?&#8221; on a scale of 0&#160;% to 100&#160;%, with 0&#160;% being never, and 100&#160;% being always [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We combined survey data with electronic medical record data such as patient demographics, type of pre-operative visit (in-person vs. telehealth), surgeon, characteristics of their surgery (e.g., open versus laparoscopic versus robotic), indications for surgery, and comorbidities. Opioid consumption was evaluated by calculating morphine milligram equivalents (MME's) from their discharge opioid prescription amount and their self-reported post-operative opioid use. For post-intervention patients (&#8220;Improve&#8221; phase), we asked patients an additional set of questions that asked them to evaluate the brochure as part of their surgical experience.</p><p id="p0065">Patients presenting in-person to their 2&#8211;4-week follow-up appointment were given a paper-based survey. Patients who were scheduled for telehealth-based post-operative visits were mailed a survey in the week preceding their appointment and then completed their survey during their telehealth visit. Patients who completed their post-operative visit over telehealth also received telephone reminders to complete and return the survey. Patients did not receive any compensation for participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><title>Outcomes, power calculations, and statistical analysis</title><p id="p0070">Our primary outcome was whether patients received sufficient information to prepare them to manage their post-operative pain. We defined this as not giving patients too little or too much information. To evaluate our primary outcome, we a priori dichotomized survey responses into two groups: those responding &#8220;no more or less&#8221; information needed and those responding that they would have liked either more or less information regarding each topic. Using a Mann-Whitney U power test we calculated the need to enroll 27 participants in the &#8220;Measure&#8221; phase (pre-intervention) and &#8220;Improve&#8221; phase (post-intervention) (total <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;54) to achieve 80&#160;% power using a two-sided alpha 0.05 comparison, under the assumption that the pre-intervention group would report 50&#160;% &#8220;no more or less&#8221; information desired compared to 85&#160;% &#8220;no more or less&#8221; information desired in the post-intervention group regarding pain control options, alternatives to opioids, or using the lowest dose of opioids possible. The assumption of 50&#160;% of the pre-intervention group reporting &#8220;no more or less&#8221; information desired came largely from our estimation of patient satisfaction with peri-operative education from prior and ongoing qualitative studies and focus groups that our research team has conducted with patients. The use of a 35&#160;% effect size came from discussions within the research team about what would constitute a clinically relevant increase in sufficiency of perioperative education. Accounting for an estimated 75&#160;% survey response rate, we planned to recruit 36 patients to each arm of the study.</p><p id="p0075">Our secondary outcomes of interest were 1) acceptability of our intervention as measured by whether patients reported that they thought the ACS SEPCAS brochure was useful in their post-operative recovery and that it should be given to every patient undergoing surgery, 2) patient reported post-operative pain, 3) opioid consumption, and 4) satisfaction with pain control. We also collected process outcomes to evaluate the real-world feasibility and potential gaps in implementation: the percentage of eligible participants who received the education, participant recall about receiving the education, and integration of education into clinic and floor workflow.</p><p id="p0080">Not all patients received all components of the educational intervention. However, we used an intention to treat analysis for those in the interventional arm regardless of whether they received both components of the educational intervention or not. Missing survey responses were not imputed and are noted in the tables. For patients in the post-intervention period who were asked questions regarding attitudes toward the SEPCAS brochure, responses were categorized by whether they agreed, disagreed, or were neutral regarding the series of questions asked about the brochure.

To reduce the burden on clinic staff, surveys were distributed prior to applying any exclusion criteria. Thus, we do not have a precise survey response rate. However, when we queried nurses during the implementation of the study, they reported that the large majority of post-op patients returned the completed survey at the end of their visit. Approximately half of participants were female with a mean age of 53&#160;years (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The pre-intervention cohort was, on average, older than those in the post-intervention group. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of current tobacco, alcohol, chronic prescription opioid use (defined as use of a prescription opioid within the last year prior to their operation), chronic pain conditions, socio-environmental factors, psychiatric conditions, or history of substance abuse. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, race, clinic site, or virtual vs. in-person post-op visits. The number of days between surgery and post-op appointment was on average, longer for those in the post-interventional period. There were no differences between the groups in terms of surgical indication (cancer vs. non-cancer related) or surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic).<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Patient demographics and clinical characteristics.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0030">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pre-intervention (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;27)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Post-intervention (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;39)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age (years) Mean, 95&#160;% CI</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60.6 (54.2&#8211;67.1)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">51.4 (46.1&#8211;56.8)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.03</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sex n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Female</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 (48.2)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">22 (56.4)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.51</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1">Race n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">White/Caucasian</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">26 (96.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38 (97.4)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&gt;0.99</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Other</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 (3.7)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 (2.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Active Smoker n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0 (0.0)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (7.9)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.26</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Current alcohol drinker n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9 (33.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (18.4)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.17</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Prescription opioid use in the last year n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8 (29.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 (33.3)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.75</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Virtual Post Op Appt n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (25.9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 (25.6)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.98</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Days between surgery and post-op visit mean, 95&#160;% CI</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.7 (17.9&#8211;25.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">29.9 (25.0&#8211;34.9)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.02</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Indication for operation n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non-cancer</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11 (40.7)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25 (64.1)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.06</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" colspan="1">Surgical approach n, (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cancer-related</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 (59.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14 (35.9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Open</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6 (22.2)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (7.7)</td><td align="char" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.14</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Laparoscopic</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14 (51.9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19 (48.7)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Robotic</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (25.9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17 (43.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Personal history of&#8230;

After defining that gap using the DMAIC framework and our literature review, we identified the ACS SEPCAS brochure as an optimal educational material given that it is evidenced based, consensus-driven, and widely available. Utilizing the brochure as the foundational material, we then created an educational model that integrates multiple educational modalities such as written and verbal components, repetition, and shared decision making which have proved effective in prior studies [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>].</p><p id="p0145">In terms of measuring the effectiveness of our educational framework, patients who received the educational bundle were more likely to report receiving an appropriate amount of information regarding how to recognize the signs of opioid overdose and how to safely store and dispose of opioid medications compared to those who did not receive the education. Our findings regarding improvement of patient understanding regarding warning signs of opioid overdose and appropriate opioid storage and disposal are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that educational interventions are effective in improving patient prescription opioid safety [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0150">Patients also reported that the ACS SEPCAS brochure itself was an important component of preparing them for their recovery. The large majority of patients indicated that the brochure was useful in their postoperative recovery, was effective in explaining how to appropriately use and dispose of their opioid prescription, and should be offered to every patient undergoing surgery. This suggests that in addition to the brochure being effective from a clinical standpoint, the ACS brochure is an appropriate and usable tool from the patient's perspective. While other studies have demonstrated similar findings in terms of patient perception of educational material [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], our study is the first to point to a standardized material such as the ACS SEPCAS brochure that is both authoritative and widely available.</p><p id="p0155">Lastly, our data is consistent with prior findings that pain is an important modulator of the patient's perioperative experience [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, those in our study who reported higher levels of post-operative pain were less satisfied with their pain control at home after surgery. We also found that patients in our study who indicated greater pain during their first week after surgery were less likely to indicate they received an appropriate amount of information regarding what pain to expect after surgery and their pain control options. Thus, addressing patient concerns about, and preparing them to adequately manage their post-operative pain is an important component of effective surgical care.</p><p id="p0160">Our study has a number of limitations. First, we conducted our study at a single institution. Future studies are needed to study the feasibility of the SEPCAS handout in other institutions and populations to improve generalizability. In addition, our real-world trial application of an educational model identified potential barriers to implementation as described in our process outcomes. Such issues included gaps in patient education due to limited staff or periods or coverage gaps on weekends or holidays. These barriers represent areas of ongoing work in the &#8220;Improve&#8221; component of the DMAIC framework. Our study may also be affected by social desirability or recall bias. However, there were patients who indicated their perception of inadequacy of the perioperative education and there was a low rate of missing data, suggesting that patients were comfortable expressing their true opinions in our survey. Given that the overall differences between the responses of those in the pre- vs. post- interventional groups were very modest (statistically significant in only 2 of the 8 categories we examined) we estimate that the effect from social desirability was likely not a major influence to their survey responses. Similarly, we did not see a significant difference in reported pain scores between the pre- and post-intervention group suggesting recall bias did not play a significant role in participants' responses. Lastly, as is common in survey-based research, we faced challenges with survey response rates, particularly for those who received the survey via mail rather than during an in-person clinic visit. Despite follow up via phone calls, those who received mailed surveys had survey response rates of an average of 16&#160;%, while nurses reported that the majority of clinic-based patient visits resulted in completed surveys.</p><p id="p0165">Future directions for these findings would be to implement the ACS SEPCAS brochure education bundle at a multi-institutional level with further streamlining of processes. For example, incorporating the brochure into pharmacists workflow (and providing additional resources) might allow them more opportunities for pre-discharge counseling. In terms of the brochure itself, patients largely agreed that it was thorough in explaining the options for perioperative pain control. However, the brochure might be improved by including a summary of key points for those patients that do not wish to utilize the brochure in its entirety.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0170">This study utilized the DMAIC framework for quality improvement to identify and address the current gap in perioperative education regarding lack of a standardized educational material and process for delivering perioperative education. We found that using the ACS SEPCAS brochure improved patient preparation to safely store and dispose of their opioid medication and recognize the signs of opioid overdose. We also found that patients were receptive to, and appreciated the brochure being part of their recovery and preparation for pain control. Lastly, we found that post-operative pain is an important component of how patients perceive their surgical experience. Due to its position as an evidence-based, authoritative, and widely available document, the ACS SEPCAS brochure is squarely positioned to become the unifying standard tool for perioperative pain management education.
