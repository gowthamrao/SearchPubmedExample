Despite increases in cannabis use, its documentation during clinical visits is not yet mainstream. This lack of information hampers efforts to study cannabis&#8217;s effects on health outcomes. A clear and in-depth understanding of current trends in cannabis use documentation is necessary to develop proper guidelines to screen and document cannabis use. Here we have developed and used a natural language processing pipeline to evaluate the trends and disparities in cannabis documentation. The pipeline includes a screening step to identify clinical notes with cannabis use documentation which is then fed into a BERT-based classifier to confirm positive use. This pipeline is applied to more than 23 million notes from a large cohort of 370,087 patients seen in a high-volume multi-site pediatric and young adult clinic over a period of 21 years. Our findings show a very low but growing rate of cannabis use documentation (&lt;2%) in electronic health records with significant demographic and socioeconomic disparities in both documentation and positive use, which requires further attention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Health policy</kwd><kwd>Population screening</kwd><kwd>Orthopaedics</kwd><kwd>Paediatric research</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the United States, cannabis is legal for medicinal use in 38 states, and recreational use in 23 states. Up to 22 million Americans 12 years old or older use cannabis annually. This is part of an upwards trend. Daily reported usage of cannabis is increasing, from 2.1% in 2016 to 3.4% in 2019 according to the national survey on drug use. There has also been increased usage among youths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Over 11.8 million young adults report cannabis use. Daily use has increased from 5.9% to 6.9% for 12th graders, 2.9% to 4.4% for 10th graders, and 0.8&#8211;1.1% for 8th graders from 2017 to 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Despite this increase in usage, proper documentation of cannabis use has not become mainstream. Such information is vital for a more accurate assessment of cannabis use rates and potential effects on treatment outcomes. For example, cannabis has been shown to influence remodeling of a range of musculoskeletal tissues (e.g., bone)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A recent study on pediatric patients with extremity fractures found significantly increased time to union in those who used cannabis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. There is also evidence suggesting cannabis use affects the outcomes of surgeries, including mortality, pain, comorbidities, and revision rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. One study found reduced mortality in cannabis users undergoing total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, and traumatic femur fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Other studies found that cannabis users had higher surgery revision rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and cannabis users undergoing spine surgery had greater perioperative morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In terms of pain after surgery, results are contradictory as well. Cannabis users reported lower pain in the operative site in one study of 937 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, while patients with preoperative cannabis use reported increased pain after major orthopedic surgery in another study of 3793 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A different study found that cannabis users had higher total prescribed opioids and longer duration of use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A recent review found that cannabis use in the form of combustive cigarettes represents perioperative risks for induction/anesthesia, post-operative pain, and analgesia in teenagers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Currently, the most common way of cannabis use documentation in patients&#8217; health records is within unstructured clinical notes, in an unstandardized manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While studies have proposed the development of standardized screening protocols to streamline documentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, yet no such protocol has been adopted widely. Currently, cannabis itself is referred to in heterogeneous ways within clinical notes, alternatively referred to as MJ, cannabis, weed, CBD, and THC. Some of these terms, specifically weed, and CBD, are nonspecific (i.e., weed also refers to other plants, and CBD also refers to common bile ducts). These terms may also be misspelled. In addition, particularly within pediatric clinical notes, there are mixed mentions of cannabis use among patients and their family members. Additional analysis is needed to distinguish whether the patient is a cannabis user. Overall, the complexity of retrieving cannabis use information from this type of heterogeneous, unstructured data has made it difficult to monitor or study.</p><p id="Par6">One approach to tackle this challenge is the use of natural language processing (NLP) to identify cannabis users. NLP uses linguistic knowledge to extract information (such as cannabis use) from human language by identifying patterns in the data. Applying NLP techniques on clinical notes comes with its own set of challenges such as the presence of noise, heterogeneity, different templates, abbreviations, misspellings, incomplete sentences, etc. Hence, many of the state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform as well when applied directly to clinical notes and the data needs to be thoroughly preprocessed and filtered before being fed into the models. Studies such as Tavabi et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Wang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and Ling et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, developed and evaluated such NLP pipelines and approaches on clinical notes for purposes like cohort identification and building registries. A few studies have focused on identifying substance use from clinical notes using NLP. One study used NLP on clinical notes to identify hospitalized trauma patients with alcohol misuse and demonstrated greater accuracy than EMR-based billing codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Another study detected alcohol, drug, or nicotine use from unstructured notes using NLP and achieved good performance over a wide breadth of notes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. When looking at cannabis use specifically, a separate study developed an NLP algorithm to identify cannabis-related terms, historical mentions, and hypothetical mentions within EHR notes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, Carrell et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> identified 54% of the notes with positive medical cannabis usage automatically and used an NLP-assisted manual review tool to identify the rest, which is a labor and time-intensive process.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we have developed an NLP pipeline to extract patients&#8217; cannabis use documentation from unstructured electronic health records and among them identify positive cannabis users. We comprehensively assess the changes in cannabis use documentation over the past 21 years along with potential disparities in documentation and positive use in a multi-site high-volume pediatric and young-adults orthopedic and sports medicine (OSM) academic practice, without the need for manual chart review. We have used the data from OSM patients considering the high prevalence of these injuries among children and young adults, and the effects of cannabis use in musculoskeletal tissue healing and remodeling. With a better understanding of how cannabis use is documented, care guidelines for a growing population of cannabis users can improve. In this study, cannabis documentation refers to any mentions of cannabis in the clinical notes, either positive or negative, and cannabis positive use refers to a subset of notes with cannabis documentation in which it is stated that the patient is a cannabis user, whether it&#8217;s medical, recreational, lab test, self-reported, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of the pipeline</title><p id="Par8">A breakdown of the pipeline developed in this study to evaluate cannabis documentation and positive use in 370,087 unique patients (23,871,108 notes) is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The generated large-scale database enabled us to investigate the changes in cannabis documentation and positivity rate over the period of 21 years, as well as potential disparities in its documentation and positive use among children and young adults. We observed an increasing trend in cannabis use documentation, in particular over the past decade, with smaller proportions within the OSM clinical notes. These increases included both overall cannabis use documentation (e.g., positive or negative) and positive use. Multiple factors may have contributed to these increasing trends. In particular, the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis use, the development of new cannabis-based medications (e.g., Epidiolex, Marinol) as well as the cultural and policy changes may all have contributed to observed increases in cannabis documentation. Cannabis was legalized for medical use in the state of Massachusetts in late 2012 and for recreational use later in 2016. These legalizations have possibly resulted in increased cannabis usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and/or greater attention paid to the documentation of cannabis use during visits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Despite increasing trends, a very small portion of notes overall documented cannabis use (&lt;2%), which for the most part contained insufficient information (i.e., duration, frequencies, amount). These findings are in line with recent studies indicating discrepancies between patient-reported cannabis (e.g., surveys) and cannabis use documentation in health records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> while showing a much lower rate than those previously reported.</p><p id="Par17">We saw significant disparities in cannabis documentation and its positive use. Female patients, non-white non-Asian racial groups, and those from a more vulnerable socioeconomic background (i.e., higher SVI) had higher rates of cannabis documentation (whether the patient was asked about cannabis usage or cannabis was discussed with the patient in any way) in their clinical notes. With regards to positive cannabis use, we saw higher rates among male patients, black or Hispanic patients, and those from a more vulnerable socioeconomic background. While the observed discrepancies in positive use are in agreement with those reported in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the demographic and socioeconomic differences in cannabis documentation highlight potential biases and implementation challenges in the proper tracking of cannabis use among children and young adults. The observed racial and socioeconomic disparities in cannabis documentation may also be an underlying factor for the observed higher positive rates among those patients. This highlights the need for a systematic and comprehensive approach to discuss and document cannabis use, regardless of patient demographic and socioeconomic background, which may in turn lead to a more accurate assessment of true disparities in cannabis use.</p><p id="Par18">We saw a comparable distribution of musculoskeletal procedures between positive cannabis users and non-users. This may suggest that the use of cannabis is not primarily influenced by underlying injuries and health conditions. However, whether the use of cannabis has downstream effects on the treatment choices and outcomes requires further evaluation. The high prevalence of cast/splint procedures, often done for treatment of bone fractures, among positive cannabis users along with prior reports of changes in bone remodeling due to cannabis use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, further highlight the importance of proper cannabis documentation to improve treatment outcomes.</p><p id="Par19">There are several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the current findings. The primary limitation of this study is limited generalizability. This study focused on a single institution, in a single state. Other states may have different policies regulating cannabis access, and patients in those states may have different cultural norms around cannabis use and disclosure. In addition, this study analyzed cannabis usage in a binary (positive/negative) manner since in most cases information on duration, frequency, and dosage were missing. Also, with the exception of toxicology reports and medical cannabis use (e.g., prescription drugs), cannabis use was self-reported which might not be accurate. Such an example could be seen in the fourth case of Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, where although the patient denied cannabis use, traces of it was found in their toxicology report. However, it should be mentioned that this is a secondary point in this study with the main takeaway being the low percentage of patients (&lt;7%) being asked about their cannabis use overall. Future studies with confirmatory endpoints (e.g., toxicology reports) are required to assess the true positive rate of cannabis consumption. Despite limitations, this study is among the most comprehensive efforts to evaluate cannabis documentation in a large corpus of clinical notes. Further, to our knowledge, our developed NLP pipeline has the highest performance metrics in capturing a diverse set of cannabis use patterns from clinical notes, which adds to the reliability of the observed findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The first step was to remove the notes that were incorrectly marked as cannabis-related. As mentioned earlier words like CBD or weed can also be used in other contexts. The acronym CBD is also used for common bile duct and is used in notes related to gastrointestinal conditions. Also, the keyword weed is used in notes related to allergy detection. To remove these irrelevant notes, 2 other sets of keywords were compiled. Words like abdominal, gallbladder, pancreas, common bile duct, etc., were used to identify and filter out notes related to the common bile duct, and words like pollen and allergy and their variations were used for allergy-related notes. The full list of keywords for filtering out notes related to the common bile duct and allergy towards weed is given in supplements. Additionally, cannabis-related notes which correspond to very young patients (under 7) were primarily related to the cannabis use in their household and not by the patient, especially during pregnancy. Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> shows a few examples for patients under age 7. Since the purpose of this study is to identify patients with direct cannabis use, patients younger than 7 years old were removed from the dataset.<table-wrap id="Tab5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Examples of cannabis-related notes for patients under 7.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Other tobacco history: Mother smoked but has quit, also use of MJ during pregnancy but has quit as well.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Birth Hx: Exposed to maternal THC in utero.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pregnancy is complicated by late care, inconsistent prenatal care, marijuana use, and viral illness 5 days prior to delivery.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He lives with his mother and occasionally with his grandmother in the housing projects where she says he is exposed to cigarette and marijuana smoke in the hallways.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par30">After the preprocessing step, the resulting dataset was used to analyze cannabis documentation. Additionally, the same dataset was used in the next steps of the pipeline for identifying positive cannabis use. The types of extracted notes were very heterogeneous, resulting in a collection of different note contents and formats. Some notes had form templates with different fields and incomplete sentences and in some others, the note contained full sentences with a lot of detailed narratives. Since usually only a small section of the note is related to cannabis use, to minimize unwanted bias related to note types (i.e., template and content), only the sentences containing the cannabis-related keywords were extracted and used as input to the classifier.</p><p id="Par31">After the screening step, the model bidirectional encoder representations from the transformers (BERT) model were used to classify the extracted sentences. BERT is an NLP model developed and trained by Google, which has been widely used across multiple domains, including healthcare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. BERT models provide contextual representations of words and sentences, which can then be used in classification. Domain-specific BERT models yield significant improvement, hence for this project we used ClinicalBERT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which has been pretrained on medical literature (PubMed corpus) and publicly available MIMIC dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We further pre trained the ClinicalBERT on all the available notes from Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital (BCH BERT; 23,871,108 notes for 1 epoch) so the model would be more familiar with the language used in the clinical notes. We then used the following deep learning model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) to classify the extracted sentences from the screening step into positive use (i.e., self-reported cannabis use by the patient or guardians currently or in the past, positive use reports by the clinical care team or toxicology reports) or negative use (i.e., patient or guardian reported no use, negative use confirmation by clinical care team or toxicology reports, discussions of pros and cons of cannabis use with no direct indication of positive use, reported abuse for someone other than the patient). The model was trained and tested on a diverse set of manually labeled sentences (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3835, 73% positive, 27% negative, 80% train, 10% validation,10% test). Note that the imbalance towards the positive class is due to the nature of the problem. Since the input to the model is all the notes containing cannabis-related keywords, and inquiring about the cannabis usage of a patient is not currently part of routine clinical care, there is a higher probability of positive cannabis usage when cannabis is mentioned in the notes.<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>NLP model for cannabis use classification.</title><p>The deep learning model is used to classify extracted sentences to identify positive cannabis use.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d32e1240" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41746_2023_885_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">The training was done for 7 epochs on an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.95, an area under the ROC curve of 0.94, a sensitivity of 0.97, and a specificity of 0.90 on the test set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To assess the relative performance of our pipeline compared to alternative strategies, we repeated the classification tasks using ClinicalBERT versus BCH BERT and using the whole note versus selected relevant sentences.

First, patients with documented cannabis use vs. patients with no documents mentioning cannabis use. Second, patients with positive cannabis use vs. patients with negative cannabis use. In the first setting the group with no documented cannabis use were never asked about cannabis usage and cannabis was not discussed in any of their notes whereas the other group had mentions of cannabis in at least one note which could be either a positive or a negative use.</p><p id="Par35">A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to evaluate the associations between sex, race, and SVI in the rate of documented cannabis use (first setting).

The aOR was calculated for the female sex compared to the male sex and for Asian, black, Hispanic, and other races compared to the white race. For SVI, the aOR was calculated for every 0.01 point change in SVI. The analysis was repeated after excluding those with medical cannabis use. The same framework was applied to assess disparities in positive vs negative cannabis users with regard to sex, race, and SVI (second setting).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Diagnostic codes for cannabis misuse</title><p id="Par36">This step was done to identify patients with diagnosed cannabis use which are compared with the patients identified by our NLP pipeline. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) are two different coding systems used for diagnosing patients. ICD codes are mostly used after the care is completed for example for billing purposes, whereas SNOMED CT is used directly by healthcare providers during the process of care. There are different ICD codes and SNOMED CTs related to cannabis use. To identify them, we extracted all diagnoses with the keyword &#8220;cannabis&#8221; in their description, and after they were reviewed and confirmed, all cases with those codes and all the patients diagnosed with them were extracted.
