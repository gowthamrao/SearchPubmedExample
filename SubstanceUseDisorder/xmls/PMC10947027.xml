This can be a particular concern in relation to First Nations or other culturally distinct populations. This study explores beliefs and attitudes of drug and alcohol clinicians when considering referral of Aboriginal Australians to involuntary drug and alcohol treatment in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Involuntary Drug and Alcohol Treatment program (IDAT) is legislated by the NSW <italic toggle="no">Drug and Alcohol Treatment Act</italic> 2007. There are two IDAT units&#8212;in urban (Sydney, four beds) and regional NSW (Orange, eight beds). NSW Health drug and alcohol clinicians who had referred clients to IDAT between 2016 and 2018 were invited to participate in a semi&#8208;structured 1:1 interview. Eleven clinicians (<italic toggle="no">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;2, male) from six local health districts (urban through to remote) agreed to participate. A descriptive qualitative analysis of responses was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0003"><title>Results</title><p>Two key themes summarised the beliefs and attitudes that clinicians reported influencing them when considering referral of Aboriginal Australians to involuntary drug and alcohol treatment in NSW: (i) dilemma between saving someone's life and being culturally safe; and (ii) need for holistic wrap&#8208;around care.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0004"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p>Almost all clinicians were worried that being in IDAT would further erode their Aboriginal client's autonomy and be retraumatising. Strategies are needed to support the involvement of Aboriginal&#8208;specific services in IDAT processes and ensure local support options for clients on discharge. Future research should examine the effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of involuntary drug and alcohol treatment programs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="dar13549-kwd-0001">alcohol</kwd><kwd id="dar13549-kwd-0002">dependence</kwd><kwd id="dar13549-kwd-0003">drugs</kwd><kwd id="dar13549-kwd-0004">involuntary</kwd><kwd id="dar13549-kwd-0005">treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council

This burden increases in younger adults (aged 15&#8211;49&#8201;years) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], in rural and remote communities, and in those with lower socio&#8208;economic status [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) Australians are disproportionately affected by the harms from alcohol and illicit drug use, with associated burden 3.1 and 4.2 times higher, respectively, than among their non&#8208;First Nations counterparts [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is comparable to First Nations peoples in similarly colonised countries (e.g., Aotearoa New Zealand [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Canada [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], United States [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). For these First Nations peoples, experience of intergenerational trauma, and past or ongoing experience of discrimination, racism [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and child removal policies can increase the risk of physical and mental health conditions, including substance use disorders [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In any setting, people with severe alcohol or other drug dependence are vulnerable, and may have multiple health conditions [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Medically supported withdrawal may be required, along with comprehensive assessment, treatment and support (e.g., relapse prevention medicines, counselling, residential programs) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A subset of individuals with severe substance use disorders are either unable or unwilling to seek treatment voluntarily [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In such complex cases, compulsory drug and alcohol treatment, where available, may be an option of &#8216;last resort&#8217; [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Compulsory or involuntary drug and alcohol treatment programs are offered in over 80% of countries worldwide [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In some programs, referrals are invoked because of law&#8208;and&#8208;order concerns [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], such as those linked to the criminal justice system [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other countries provide involuntary treatment that is initiated because of health concerns (and is typically connected to the health system). In this scenario, involuntary care is provided for under mental health or drug&#8208; and/or alcohol&#8208;related legislation [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In Australia, compulsory drug and alcohol treatment options, initiated because of health concerns, are provided for by legislation in three states: New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Tasmania (Table&#160;<xref rid="dar13549-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

As well as these three health&#8208;focused models, in the Northern Territory of Australia, a mandatory alcohol treatment program existed for several years where individuals were sent for treatment based on law&#8208;and&#8208;order concerns. However, that program was repealed in 2017 over concerns of lack of efficacy and excessive referrals of First Nations Australians compared with other Australians (97% vs. 3%; 2014&#8211;2015) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="dar13549-tbl-0001" content-type="TABLE" orientation="portrait"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Compulsory in&#8208;patient drug and alcohol treatment legislation in Australia (current/most recent in past 5&#8201;years)<xref rid="dar13549-note-0001" ref-type="table-fn">

A recent systematic review found that 78% of included studies showed no significant impact of involuntary treatment on drug use or criminal recidivism compared with voluntary treatment [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, these studies are heterogeneous in design (e.g., prospective, longitudinal observational), program length (days to years) and location (inpatient vs. prison vs. outpatient) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are no existing randomised controlled trials and only limited evidence in case series based on small numbers of patients [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Australia (NSW), a study using a retrospective matched cohort found that both voluntary and involuntary drug and alcohol treatment were associated with reduced health service utilisation in the year following treatment, with no significant difference between the two groups [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In another NSW study, clinicians and some clients report clear benefits across a range of domains for some individuals with severe substance use disorders [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the program continues to operate.</p><p>Although the NSW Involuntary Drug and Alcohol Treatment program (IDAT) is open to all residents of the state, between 2016&#8211;2018, referrals of Aboriginal Australians to that program significantly decreased compared to referrals of non&#8208;First Nations Australians (data not published; personal communication with a recent IDAT medical director, Lee Nixon). Note, that the term &#8216;Aboriginal&#8217; is used in this report to refer to First Nations Australians residing in NSW in accordance with direction from the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and because the majority of First Nations individuals in that state are Aboriginal rather than Torres Strait Islander. Despite this falling referral rate, over the same period the rate of alcohol&#8208;related hospitalisations among Aboriginal Australians in NSW was eight times higher than in their non&#8208;First Nations counterparts [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have described the ethical dilemmas of providing involuntary treatment [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, clinicians may find referring individuals to involuntary care difficult because of the conflict between paternalism and promoting self&#8208;determination [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These issues are amplified in a First Nations context, given ongoing disempowerment, trauma and loss of culture, due to the forced removal of First Nations peoples from their land and often removal of their children [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have focused on beliefs and attitudes of clinicians when considering referrals of First Nations peoples to involuntary drug and alcohol treatment. Therefore, this study explores the beliefs and attitudes of drug and alcohol clinicians when considering the referral of Aboriginal Australians to IDAT in NSW, Australia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="dar13549-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec id="dar13549-sec-0007"><label>2.1</label><title>
Aboriginal leadership
</title><p>This study was conceived and led by Lynette M. Bullen, a Wiradjuri woman with over 25&#8201;years of experience as a drug and alcohol clinician in remote, regional and urban NSW. An Aboriginal Advisory Committee (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;6), with expertise in Aboriginal health, clinical workforce development and research, guided the study. This group consisted of Aboriginal leaders employed within NSW Health (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;5) and a representative of the Aboriginal Corporation Drug and Alcohol Network (the body representing Aboriginal drug and alcohol workers in government and non&#8208;government sectors in NSW).</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0008"><label>2.2</label><title>
Setting
</title><sec id="dar13549-sec-0009"><label>2.2.1</label><title>
Involuntary drug and alcohol treatment program in NSW
</title><p>IDAT in NSW is covered by legislation in the NSW <italic toggle="yes">Drug and Alcohol Treatment Act</italic> 2007 [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It provides medical treatment and respite as a last course of action for individuals with severe alcohol or other drug dependence [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There are two secure IDAT units for individuals who meet the essential criteria for admission&#8212;in urban (Sydney, four beds) and regional NSW (Orange, eight beds). There are four eligibility criteria for involuntary treatment: (i) the individual must have a severe substance use dependence; (ii) care or treatment of the individual is deemed necessary to protect that person from serious harm; (iii) refusal of treatment for substance use dependence but would likely benefit from receiving this treatment; and (iv) no other appropriate or less restrictive means are reasonably available.</p><p>Referrals to IDAT are made by government&#8208;run local health districts across NSW and (less commonly) from community&#8208;based medical practitioners (i.e., with no involvement from NSW Health). To enter an IDAT program, an initial 28&#8208;day &#8216;Dependency Certificate&#8217; is required from one of two medical practitioners in NSW specially accredited to do this. This certificate is then presented to a magistrate within 7&#8201;days. An involuntary stay can be extended by up to an additional 56&#8201;days (total of 84&#8201;days) if a patient is identified as having a substance use&#8208;related brain injury.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0010"><label>2.2.2</label><title>
Participants
</title><p>Drug and alcohol clinicians employed by NSW Health were invited to participate in the study if they had referred an individual (Aboriginal or non&#8208;Aboriginal) to an IDAT Unit between September 2016 and December 2018. That study period was chosen to allow the findings of this study to relate to an independent evaluation conducted of IDAT over that same period [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0011"><label>2.2.3</label><title>
Recruitment
</title><p>The lead investigator (LMB) works as a senior drug and alcohol clinician in an IDAT unit in NSW. To ensure participant comfort and openness in the interviews, an independent researcher (AM), with no role in the operations of IDAT, conducted recruitment (assisted by KMC and KSKL) and interviews in 2019. Lynette M. Bullen had no access to the names of clinicians invited to interview or to those who consented to take part.</p><p>Permission was sought from the medical director of each IDAT Unit to access the names of referring drug and alcohol clinicians who met the study criteria (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;54). Clinical nurse consultants in each IDAT unit then provided a list of potential interviewees (to AM). Eligible clinicians were emailed an invitation to take part in the study by a senior addiction medicine physician employed by NSW Health (KMC). Clinicians were asked to register their interest in participating by email or phone (with AM; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;11). For those who did not respond (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;43), a follow&#8208;up invitation was emailed approximately 2&#8201;weeks later (by KMC). A final email was sent to non&#8208;responders (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;43) by an IDAT clinical nurse consultant approximately 1&#8201;week later again. No further contact was made after the third email.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0012"><label>2.2.4</label><title>
Data collection
</title><p>Semi&#8208;structured interviews were conducted (by AM) with each clinician between October and November 2019 by secure NSW Health video conferencing. The interview schedule was organised into four domains, focusing on: (i) the clinician and where they worked; (ii) referring Aboriginal clients to IDAT; (iii) advantages and disadvantages of an involuntary treatment admission; and (iv) support to assist with admissions and discharges (Table&#160;<xref rid="dar13549-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Interview questions were piloted with two NSW Health clinicians (a male Aboriginal mental health worker; a female clinical nurse consultant). Average interview duration was 38&#8201;min (range: 19&#8211;61&#8201;min).

Data analysis
</title><p>The analysis was conducted independently by two researchers (LMB, by hand; CZ, using NVivo version 12). Guidance was provided by K. S. Kylie Lee and Katherine M. Conigrave. A descriptive qualitative research study was conducted to offer a comprehensive summary of beliefs and attitudes of clinicians who have referred patients to IDAT. This approach allowed us to draw upon theories and methods across qualitative research [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The lens of naturalism was applied [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to study this phenomenon in a manner free of artifice. We used conventional qualitative content analysis [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and drew upon the constant comparison technique that is associated with Grounded Theory [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This involved independent inductive category coding by two researchers to describe and tabulate the data as per the study aims alongside a simultaneous comparison of experiences across all the transcripts. An analysis meeting was convened by video conference to discuss category coding and to compare and refine categories until consensus was reached on key themes and sub&#8208;themes (LMB, CZ, AD, KMC and KSKL). The informational contents of the data were then summarised in a manner that best fitted the data.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="dar13549-sec-0014"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 54 clinicians who met the study criteria and were invited to participate, 11 agreed to take part (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;2/11 male).

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="dar13549-sec-0021"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study worldwide to examine the beliefs and attitudes of drug and alcohol clinicians when considering referral of First Nations peoples to involuntary drug and alcohol treatment. Some clinicians questioned their ability to make a difference for their Aboriginal clients because of limited aftercare options available on discharge from IDAT, and the perceived normalisation of drinking or drug use in the individuals' home environment. However, the majority of clinicians recognised the likely benefits gained for clients from the highly specialised, comprehensive and multi&#8208;disciplinary care provided by this service. Despite the dilemmas for service providers, when faced with a &#8216;life or death&#8217; decision related to a client's substance use dependence, the client's ethnicity itself was not perceived as a barrier to referral for the majority clinicians interviewed. A key strength of the study is that it was led by an Aboriginal woman of the Wiradjuri nation (LMB) who is also a senior drug and alcohol clinician in NSW Health.</p><p>Almost all clinicians were worried that being forced to attend IDAT would further erode their client's autonomy and be retraumatising [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is especially relevant for Aboriginal Australian clients given their past and current experience of discriminatory policies [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and higher rates of imprisonment (of themselves or loved ones) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These negative past experiences also likely place Aboriginal clients at greater risk of distressed or angry responses [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as a result of being compelled to attend involuntary treatment.</p><p>While removing people from country was primarily seen by clinicians as a traumatic thing, there are cultural parallels to this, when enforced by First Nations Australian communities themselves. In one such community in remote Northern Territory, young people who were sniffing petrol were moved away from the community for a period of healing &#8216;on country&#8217; [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While we could not find formal documentation of this type of community&#8208;driven approach being used for adults, anecdotally, in many parts of Australia, older relatives will tell an Aboriginal adult they must come away with them, to move away from substance&#8208;using associates or away from supply of the substance.</p><p>Once in IDAT, having a more culturally appropriate and less &#8216;sterile&#8217; environment was identified as important for Aboriginal Australian clients by a couple of clinicians [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is likely to be particularly important for Aboriginal clients given the cultural connection to outdoor spaces and the land, and also because of history of lack of control when interacting with non&#8208;Indigenous services [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Referrals are made to IDAT based on health needs [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and treatment is offered based on a holistic approach. This differs from a crime prevention focus, as of the former Alcohol Mandatory Treatment Program in the Northern Territory [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While NSW's IDAT clients are not free to discharge themselves, they have access to &#8216;gate leave&#8217; once deemed to be sufficiently stable&#160;[<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A similar program to the NSW IDAT operates in the state of Victoria. However, it offers a shorter stay (maximum duration 14 vs. 84&#8201;days) [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="dar13549-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The longer duration in NSW's IDAT can allow more time for holistic care, such as neuro&#8208;psychiatric assessment, and linking to integrated aftercare, such as housing and disability support. This includes preparations for aftercare support to gain employment, education or training where appropriate, and other needs such as parenting support and building social connections. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of care that is informed by the social determinants of health [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition to this, ensuring continuity of care with local services [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] during an IDAT stay could help support optimal outcomes for the client and their family on discharge.</p><p>A lack of available culturally appropriate aftercare options for Aboriginal clients was a limiting factor for the majority of clinicians when considering referral to IDAT. Limited availability of such programs or supports on discharge might mean that any gains made while in IDAT may not be built on when the client returns to the community (e.g., via culturally tailored mutual support groups [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], men's or women's groups [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], residential programs [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). Addressing this limitation is especially challenging in the current climate of dwindling resources for Aboriginal drug and alcohol programs or services [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The holistic model of care offered by IDAT is designed to cater to individuals with a range of complex psychosocial and medical issues [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; for example, a person with alcohol&#8208;related brain damage who cannot get to the point of stopping drinking, or a person with recurrent or prolonged stimulant&#8208;induced psychosis who cannot get their thoughts clear enough to decide if they want to stop or continue using methamphetamine. However, while referring clinicians (and local services who support the referral) saw the advantages of IDAT, some remained reluctant to refer Aboriginal clients because of potentially damaging impacts on their relationships with the client, their family, and the broader community. It is worth considering what mechanisms could be implemented to support these delicate relationships and to foster trust in local services [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], while still providing access to &#8216;last resort&#8217; involuntary care if needed. Where appropriate, working with the client's family in preparation for an IDAT referral could assist with understanding of the process and build, rather than detract from relationships between clinician and client.</p><p>Some clinicians highlighted that the low number of Aboriginal ITLOs in NSW could also be impeding awareness of IDAT in Aboriginal communities. They suggested that making this training available to the Aboriginal drug and alcohol workforce, in government and non&#8208;government sectors, could enhance awareness of IDAT in Aboriginal communities across&#160;NSW. However, this goal will be in tension with the reluctance of Aboriginal staff or organisations to be involved in a referral to IDAT, as reported by interviewees. Early discussions are underway in NSW Health to enable staff from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services to participate in ITLO training. This could also provide an opportunity for Aboriginal service providers to have input into the suitability of IDAT for a range of contexts&#160;[<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In any case, a stronger link with Aboriginal health services before and after an IDAT treatment episode would increase clinicians' comfort when referring Aboriginal clients to IDAT. Regardless of staff efforts in relation to cultural safety, the trauma some staff and Aboriginal clients feel, when a client is forced to attend treatment against their will, is likely to remain. Efforts to empower the person are likely to be particularly important for Aboriginal clients, given the history of disempowerment. For example, explaining their right to appeal to the magistrate, and asking about anything staff could provide for their travel to an IDAT unit, such as nicotine replacement therapy or food.</p><sec id="dar13549-sec-0022"><label>4.1</label><title>
Implications
</title><p>Findings from this study could inform policymakers in their efforts to enhance access to IDAT for Aboriginal clients. An opportunity exists for IDAT units to examine what could be done to increase cultural safety and comfort of IDAT facilities&#8212;particularly for clients who need to be 'off country' and away from family to attend one of the two units. Ongoing research is needed to examine effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of involuntary drug and alcohol treatment offered in Australia [<xref rid="dar13549-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Research is also required to understand the experiences and needs of Aboriginal peoples referred to IDAT, and of their families&#8212;to better tailor IDAT for their needs. Such studies should be led by Aboriginal researchers and communities and designed to suit diverse local contexts.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0023"><label>4.2</label><title>
Limitations
</title><p>Only 20% of clinicians who were invited agreed to take part in the study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;11/54). Clinicians who took part may have had different views from those who did not. Just over half of the clinicians who took part (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;6/11) had referred an Aboriginal person to IDAT. As this study was concerned with reasons for referring or not referring an Aboriginal client, this balance was seen as useful. Eligible participants had to have made a referral to IDAT between 2016 and 2018. It is likely that some clinicians who were approached for interview no longer worked in their drug and alcohol role or for NSW Health. It is also possible that clinician perspectives of IDAT from referrals made in 2016&#8211;2018 may differ from those of clinicians who had referred more recently. The findings cannot be generalised to the experiences of other NSW Health clinicians or those interacting with other compulsory care programs across Australia or internationally.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="dar13549-sec-0024"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study describes the beliefs and attitudes of drug and alcohol clinicians when considering the referral of Aboriginal clients to involuntary drug and alcohol treatment in NSW. Most clinicians interviewed were concerned that such a referral could retraumatise Aboriginal clients. For clinicians who had referred Aboriginal clients to IDAT, the likely benefits outweighed these concerns. Strategies are needed to support greater involvement of Aboriginal&#8208;specific services in IDAT and to ensure adequate local culturally appropriate support options for clients on discharge. Future research should examine effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of involuntary drug and alcohol programs for First Nations clients, including in similarly colonised countries.</p></sec><sec id="dar13549-sec-0125"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Each author certifies that their contribution to this work meets the standards of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
