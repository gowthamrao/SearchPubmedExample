Cardiac rehabilitation, a secondary prevention programme, aims to increase physical activity levels in this population from a reported low baseline. This trial will investigate the effectiveness and implementation of a very brief physical activity intervention, comparing different frequencies of physical activity measurement by cardiac rehabilitation clinicians. The Measure It! intervention (&lt;5&#8201;min) includes a self-report and objective measure of physical activity (steps) plus very brief physical activity advice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This type 1 hybrid effectiveness&#8211;implementation study will use a two-arm multicentre assessor-blind randomised trial design. Insufficiently active (&lt;150&#8201;min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week) cardiac rehabilitation attendees with CHD (18+ years) will be recruited from five phase II cardiac rehabilitation centres (n=190). Patients will be randomised (1:1) to five physical activity measurements or two physical activity measurements in total over 24&#8201;weeks. The primary effectiveness outcome is accelerometer daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity at 24&#8201;weeks. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include body mass index, waist circumference and quality-of-life. An understanding of multilevel contextual factors that influence implementation, and antecedent outcomes to implementation of the intervention (eg, feasibility and acceptability), will be obtained using semistructured interviews and other data sources. Linear mixed-effects models will be used to analyse effectiveness outcomes. Qualitative data will be thematically analysed inductively and deductively using framework analysis, with the framework guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Theoretical Domains Framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has ethical approval (University of Canberra (ID 11836), Calvary Bruce Public Hospital (ID 14-2022) and the Greater Western Area (ID 2022/<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-protein" xlink:href="ETH01381">ETH01381</ext-link>) Human Research Ethics Committees).

behaviour are risk factors for cardiovascular and all-causes of death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;6</xref> Active people with CHD have a 50% lower risk of mortality, compared with inactive counterparts.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sufficient physical activity reduces the impact of CHD, slows its progress and improves modifiable risk factors for recurrent cardiovascular disease and other chronic disease.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;10</xref> Consequently, in secondary prevention programmes such as cardiac rehabilitation, individuals are encouraged to meet the public health physical activity guidelines to improve health outcomes, that is, achieve at least 150&#8201;min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;13</xref> Nevertheless, systematic reviews<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> report that physical activity is low in cardiac rehabilitation attendees during and after cardiac rehabilitation, with as little as 10&#8201;min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity being completed per day.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, meta-analyses have found no difference in minutes per day spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity between exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and control groups.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Effective, time-efficient, low cost, and easily implementable physical activity interventions are needed in cardiac rehabilitation programmes for people with CHD. A possible solution may be using measurement reactivity and the mere-measurement effect.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> These measurement effects lead to changes in the behaviour under investigation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> The Theory of Planned Behaviour suggests that an individual&#8217;s future behaviour can be predicted by intention to perform the behaviour.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Intention is conceptualised through an individual&#8217;s attitude towards the behaviour (ie, favourable or not), their subjective norm (ie, perception of how others view the behaviour) and their perceived control over performing the behaviour.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> By participating in measurements related to a behaviour, patients can form a belief about that behaviour in terms of personal importance, importance of the behaviour as viewed by others (eg, their health professional) and their ability to perform it, potentially leading to changes in the behaviour (in this case, physical activity). Currently, the precise mechanism of action behind measurement reactivity and the mere-measurement effect remains to be determined, with a range of possible underlying mechanisms including Michie&#8217;s behaviour change techniques of &#8216;prompts/cues&#8217; and &#8216;credible source&#8217;.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19</xref></p><p>Despite insufficient knowledge regarding the specific mechanism, there is evidence that measurement of physical activity alone can result in improvements in physical activity. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> indicate that simply measuring physical activity levels in control groups as part of randomised studies of physical activity interventions, increases physical activity behaviour in up to one-third of studies. This pattern-of-findings indicates that with minimal intervention and resources, physical activity behaviour change may be achievable in a proportion of the population, although people with chronic disease may require additional support.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Additionally, more frequent measurement of physical activity (4 measures vs 2) by a health professional over 18&#8201;weeks has been found to increase physical activity levels within insufficiently active healthy adults.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, frequent measurement of physical activity embedded within cardiac rehabilitation programmes, with very brief advice by cardiac rehabilitation clinicians (any health professional involved in the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation), may be an intervention that can result in favourable increases in physical activity levels in people with CHD.</p><p>Wearable activity trackers and smartphone apps have also been found to increase physical activity in people with CHD and cardiac rehabilitation attendees in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Smartphone usage within cardiac rehabilitation is high, with approximately 70% of patients reporting that they have a smartphone.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> However, alone and without suitable monitoring, wearable activity trackers and smartphone apps are unlikely to result in sustained increased physical activity levels.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A study conducted in Singapore with 800 employees found that wearable activity trackers stopped the reduction in physical activity seen in the control group over 12&#8201;months; however, at 12&#8201;months, only 10% of participants in the intervention groups were still wearing the devices.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, considering the potential impact of measurement of physical activity by health professionals and the effectiveness of wearable activity trackers and smartphone apps for people with CHD our research questions for this trial are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Is very brief measurement of physical activity by cardiac rehabilitation clinicians on five occasions over 24&#8201;weeks more effective than two physical activity measurements in improving physical activity levels in insufficiently active adults with CHD?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What are the potential factors that can be leveraged to promote the implementation of this intervention, &#8216;Measure It!&#8217;, in cardiac rehabilitation programmes and the secondary care setting?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This type 1 hybrid effectiveness&#8211;implementation study<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> will use a two-arm multicentre assessor-blind randomised trial design (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).

The secondary effectiveness outcome measures include body mass index, waist circumference and quality-of-life (AQoL-6D). Physical activity promotion practices from participating cardiac rehabilitation clinicians and costs will also be collected. Outcome measures will be collected at 24&#8201;weeks (end-intervention; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). To maintain assessor-blinding, outcome measures will be completed by cardiac rehabilitation clinicians at each site trained in all procedures and not aware of group status.</p><p>A triaxial commercial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, Fort Walton Beach, FL) will be used to objectively assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Device-based measurement of physical activity has lower levels of variability for validity and reliability compared with self-report measures.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Patients will be asked to wear the accelerometer on their right hip, while awake, for 7-consecutive days at baseline and 24&#8201;weeks, returning the accelerometer via mail in the reply-paid package provided. All data will be sampled and downloaded as raw data (30&#8201;Hz), converted to 15&#8201;s epochs (time interval), and then counts per minute (cpm) using the Actilife software.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> A &#8216;count&#8217; is the unit of measure for activity for ActiGraph&#8217;s activity monitors.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Data will be screened, excluding data if: &lt;10&#8201;hours per day wear time (non-wear defined as &gt;60 consecutive minutes where there is zero activity, with no allowance of epochs with counts above zero) and less than 4&#8201;days of valid data.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34 36</xref> The Sasaki vector magnitude three cut-points will be used to determine time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (&#8805;2690&#8201;cpm).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34 36 37</xref> To measure sedentary behaviour, the vector magnitude cut-point will be used (&lt;150&#8201;cpm), categorising light physical activity as 150&#8211;2689 cpm.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34 36 38</xref> These cut-points have not been validated in CHD participants, although they have been used in prior research in this population.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34 39</xref> Both cut-points have been validated in younger, generally healthy participants<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> and currently no cut-points are available for people with CHD. Estimating daily time spent in physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be calculated by dividing the total time spent (minutes) in each threshold by the number of valid days.</p><p>Height (m), weight (kg) and body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be recorded using a calibrated set of scales and a stadiometer. Waist circumference will be measured in centimetres using a stretch-resistant tape measure.

The AQoL has evidence to support its reliability and validity in community settings and the multiattribute utility score from the instrument is suitable for use in economic evaluations.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref></p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation clinicians will be asked to complete an online survey that includes general descriptive questions (eg, age, gender, years of experience and average number of patients seen per week) preintervention and postintervention. They will also be asked about their physical activity promotion practices, perceived role in physical activity promotion, barriers to promotion, feasibility of different strategies, knowledge of the physical activity guidelines and personal physical activity levels using a validated survey.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Additionally, cardiac rehabilitation clinicians will be asked to record patient admission diagnosis and the number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions completed.</p><p>Healthcare resource use will also be collected from a healthcare provider perspective throughout the trial. This will include both trial-intervention resource use (eg, cardiac rehabilitation clinician&#8217;s time) and non-trial intervention healthcare use which may be impacted (eg, hospital visits; Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme items from Services Australia, where patients have consented to access). Healthcare resource use collected during the trial will be used to inform a subsequent economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Implementation outcomes</title><p>Contextual factors influencing implementation and antecedent outcomes to implementation of the intervention (eg, feasibility and acceptability) will be evaluated. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with patients and treating cardiac rehabilitation clinicians, purposively sampled<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> to achieve representation of these participants at each cardiac rehabilitation programme site, across the intervention implementation period and across patient ages and clinician levels (eg, managers, nurses and physiotherapists). In studies of this nature, the exact number of participants needed for interviews is not known in advance but becomes known during iterative collection and analysis. It is estimated that 25 interview participants (patients and clinicians) will be required to obtain representation of these characteristics. Sampling participants will continue until the point at which no new concepts or categories are formed and when there is no need for further elaboration of the concepts or categories.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Qualitative data collected will also include observations of the cardiac rehabilitation programme context, field notes taken by the research team, and documents referred to in interviews. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> will be used to understand multilevel contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation success or failure, why the physical activity intervention works or does not work and how the intervention should be optimally implemented. Interviews will be led by an experienced qualitative researcher following implementation of the intervention. Patients and cardiac rehabilitation clinicians will be asked about the acceptability of the intervention and implementation strategies using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), a valid and reliable scale,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> which will be electronically administered following each interview.

Together, the analyses will provide direction for a future implementation trial, should the intervention be successful and demonstrated to be resource efficient. The trustworthiness and rigour of the qualitative analysis will be maintained through member checking of transcripts, reflexive journaling, being led by a researcher experienced in qualitative and implementation science research and triangulation of the results (mixed-methods) across informants (patients, cardiac rehabilitation clinicians) and data sources (observational, interview and AIM survey data). Interview findings and domains of the CFIR and TDF will be examined to determine whether any contextual factors distinguish between the study conditions (&#8216;Measure It!&#8217; frequency). The contextual factors consistently relating to the extent of implementation success (or failure) across all cardiac rehabilitation clinicians will be identified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Data management</title><p>Participant paper and electronic files will be maintained in secure storage and on a password-protected computer throughout the project.

This oversight will occur informally via phone or online (email and teleconference), or formally in monthly research team meetings, and will involve site visits to participating cardiac rehabilitation programmes.</p><p>Project Advisory Group meetings will be held biannually. The function of the advisory group is to offer opportunities for interactive processes between researchers, clinicians and community members. The advisory group will provide guidance and practical input on how the study can be conducted and how results can be disseminated, discussing actual, potential and emerging risks such as low recruitment rates, drop-outs, intervention fidelity, safety, data management and ethical issues.</p><p>If an adverse event occurs while a patient is taking part in the study, they will be managed immediately in line with university and hospital policies and procedures. If there is an adverse event that is related to the intervention, the chief investigator will be made aware of group allocation and will discuss continuation of the patient&#8217;s involvement with the research team. Any adverse events will be reported to the ethics committee and advisory group. A database of adverse events will be kept and reported accordingly.</p><p>The ethics applications allow for different recruitment, intervention and outcome measure scenarios depending on the COVID-19 public health, hospital and University recommendations at the time of recruitment and measurement, completing a University COVID-19 Project Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan (RAMP). The RAMP includes risk stratification (low, medium or high risk for COVID-19 transmission) and has been approved by the University as well as the Human Research Ethics Committees. If a patient, cardiac rehabilitation clinician or research assistant tests positive to COVID-19, all people in contact with that person will be advised and act according to public health, hospital and University recommendations at the time.</p><p>Any changes to the protocol will be discussed with the research and clinical teams, and the Project Advisory Group and reported to the Human Research Ethics Committees, funder and trial participants.

Taking advantage of possible measurement reactivity and the common use of wearables and apps in cardiac rehabilitation, this novel intervention will allow routine promotion of physical activity. This is a new approach to solving the problem of lack of time, which is the number one barrier to physical activity promotion within clinical consultations as reported by health professionals.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54 55</xref> Cardiac rehabilitation clinicians have many opportunities to promote physical activity, with one-third of people with heart disease referred to cardiac rehabilitation programmes in Australia.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Yet, physical activity levels are low in this population. Establishing whether higher frequency &#8216;Measure It!&#8217; provides a time, resource efficient and effective approach to targeting people with heart disease who attend cardiac rehabilitation will help advance this field. These findings have real-world potential to drive changes in current health delivery practice by directly informing cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention services, in turn leading to improved health for a large number of people with CHD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval has been received from the University of Canberra (ID 11836), Calvary Bruce Public Hospital (ID 14&#8211;2022) and the Greater Western Area (ID 2022/<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-protein" xlink:href="ETH01381">ETH01381</ext-link>) Human Research Ethics Committees.</p><p>This trial will develop robust, scalable and context-specific implementation strategies for &#8216;Measure It!&#8217; that can be tested in future to promote physical activity behaviour change and move towards sustainable implementation if the effectiveness of the intervention is supported.
