Compared with NC, people who were formerly incarcerated in RI experienced a sustained decrease of 72 per 100&#8201;000 person-years (95% CI, &#8722;108 to &#8722;36 per 100&#8201;000 person-years) in all-cause mortality per quarter after Medicaid expansion. Similar decreases were observed in RI in drug overdose deaths (&#8722;172 per 100 000 person-years per 6 months; 95% CI, &#8722;226 to &#8722;117 per 100&#8201;000 person-years), including opioid and polydrug overdoses, and homicide deaths (&#8722;23 per 100 000 person-years per year; 95% CI, &#8722;50 to 4 per 100&#8201;000 person-years) after Medicaid expansion. Suicide mortality did not change after Medicaid expansion. After Medicaid expansion in RI, non-Hispanic White individuals experienced 3 times greater sustained decreases in all-cause mortality than all racially minoritized individuals combined, while non-Hispanic Black individuals did not experience any substantial benefits.

The data were linked deterministically using Soundex of last name, Soundex of first name, date of birth, and sex. We linked NC data at the University of North Carolina, while the RI data were linked at the RI Department of Health, using the same method, then shared deidentified data. The incarceration release data included release date, incarceration date, age at release, self-reported race and ethnicity, and sex. Release records were excluded if a person was being temporarily held while the judicial proceedings were ongoing (as they may not have been convicted and may have a different experience than those with convictions and incarcerations), younger than 18 years at release, died while incarcerated, or was not released from incarceration before the end of study period. Postrelease person-time was calculated as time in the community from the date of release until reincarceration, death, or the end of the study, whichever came first. Individuals who experienced reincarceration contributed multiple periods of person-time upon release throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-ZOI240892"><title>Outcomes</title><p>We examined all-cause mortality and deaths due to unintentional drug overdose, unintentional opioid and polydrug overdose, suicide, and homicide, defined using death certificate <italic toggle="yes">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision</italic> codes (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI240892-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). One-year postrelease mortality rates were calculated for each outcome by dividing the number of deaths within 365 days of release by the person-years accrued within 365 days post release. Two-year postrelease homicide and suicide rates were calculated in the same manner. We calculated 2-year postrelease homicide and suicide death rates instead of 1-year postrelease death rates because both are rare outcomes and the RI formerly incarcerated population was small, limiting the ability to calculate stable 1-year postrelease mortality rates. We created separate time series of these 1- and 2-year mortality rates using quarterly, 6-month, and annual intervals from 2009 to 2019 for both the RI and NC formerly incarcerated populations. All rates are expressed per 100&#8201;000 person-years.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-ZOI240892"><title>Exposure</title><p>We used the Medicaid expansion implementation date of January 1, 2014, in RI as the interruption in the controlled interrupted time series analyses, such that January 2014 was the first postintervention month (lagged effects are addressed in the Statistical Analysis section). North Carolina, a nonexpansion state, served as a control for natural trend changes, national policy landscape, and seasonality in mortality rates among people who were formerly incarcerated.

Since Medicaid expansion may impact reincarceration, we analyzed Medicaid expansion and reincarceration rates and if the Medicaid expansion and mortality association varied among people with only 1 vs multiple incarceration.

However, most people are released on probation or parole of 9 months to a year, which reduces the underestimation probability of 1-year postrelease mortality rates. Second, RI and NC data may not be representative of people who were formerly incarcerated in all Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states. However, pre-Medicaid expansion mortality rates in RI trended similar to those in NC, a state that trends similar to the rest of the country. Third, given the small study population size of RI, we were not able to fully examine EMM in the policy impact for all racial and ethnic groups. However, the evidence of racialized disparities is robust in our sensitivity analyses and is supported by prior studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi240892r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240892r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Fourth, the impact of Medicaid expansion may not be fully idealized in some chronic health conditions that respond to treatment and care access gradually.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI240892"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this quasi-experimental cohort study, Medicaid expansion was associated with reductions in postrelease mortality among people who were formerly incarcerated, specifically from drug overdose and homicides.
