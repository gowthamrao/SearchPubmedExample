The 2016 CDC Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on prescribing opioids to patients aged 18 years and older in primary care settings to treat chronic pain, excluding active cancer pain, palliative care, and end-of-life care.<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230940r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230940r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The goal of this voluntary guideline was to reduce opioid-related harms by enhancing safety of pain care, improving communication between physician and patient on the risks and benefits of opioid therapy and reducing the risks of long-term opioid use (eg, opioid use disorder), while also providing patients with chronic pain needed pain relief.</p><p>Prior evaluations of the 2016 CDC Guideline have estimated changes in opioid prescribing following the guideline release.

This study analyzes several measures of opioid dispensing rates using an administrative database at the state level, focusing on disaggregating the national trends that have been the focus of all previous 2016 CDC Guideline evaluations and showing state-level trends and changes.

These data have been used in several previous studies of opioid prescribing trajectories.<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230940r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Due to changes in how the number of prescriptions filled are counted after 2018,<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> this analysis only focused on trends up to 2018. All calculations excluded buprenorphine products intended to treat opioid use disorder. Additionally, the only buprenorphine products left in the data set (Butrans and Belbuca) were also excluded from the analysis of mean MME per capita due to the lack of a well-validated MME conversion factor for those medications. A table with all drugs in the data set that met inclusion criteria, and whether or not the drug is long-acting, is given in eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230940-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We used annual US Census state-level population estimates available through the American Community Survey<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> to compute per capita prescribing measures. Using those data sources, for each month we computed 4 state-level opioid prescribing outcomes. The first was overall opioid dispensing rate, which is the total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100&#8201;000 persons. The second was high-dosage dispensing rate, which is the total number of high-dosage opioid prescriptions dispensed (each 90 MME/d or higher) per 100&#8201;000 persons. Third, long-acting (eg, methadone) dispensing rate, which is the total number of long-acting opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100&#8201;000 persons. And the fourth was mean MME per capita, calculated by dividing the total MME dispensed by the size of the population. MME was calculated as the product of quantity, strength per unit, and MME conversion factor, summed across each month in each state. As shorthand, we refer to the first 3 outcomes as prescriptions per 100&#8201;000 persons throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-ZOI230940"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To quantify changes in prescribing trajectories before vs after the 2016 CDC Guideline release, we used interrupted time series analysis with segmented regressions.<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> These models essentially fit linear regression models to the trends before and after the guidelines were released, allowing both the level and slope to change after the 2016 CDC Guideline release. Level changes (ie, shifts in the model intercept following the 2016 CDC Guideline release) correspond to an immediate shift in each outcome following the 2016 CDC Guideline release, and slope changes correspond to a change in the rate of change (eg, acceleration of a decreasing trend). The breakpoint in these regressions corresponded to the timing of the 2016 CDC Guideline release&#8212;March 2016. Because this voluntary guideline did not have any global implementation we chose not to incorporate an implementation lag into the analysis. We note that this choice, if anything, is conservative because if there truly was an implementation lag, the assumption of an immediate effect would mix the periods immediately prior to and following the release of the guideline, attenuating any estimate of the postguideline change.</p><p>The analysis focuses on state-to-state heterogeneity in the primary inferential target: the difference in estimated preguideline and postguideline slopes. Specifically, for a given state, we modeled the month <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> dispensing rate, <italic toggle="yes">Y<sub>t</sub></italic>, as a linear function of <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> (time in months, starting from January 2012), the slope and intercept of which were allowed to change based on the indicator <italic toggle="yes">G<sub>t</sub></italic>, for which &#8220;1&#8221; is if month <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> is after the guideline release and &#8220;0&#8221; otherwise. The segmented regression equation is:</p><disp-formula id="zoi230940ea"><italic toggle="yes">Y<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>&#8201;=&#8201;</sub><italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic><sub>0&#8201;</sub>+&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic><sub>1</sub>t&#8201;+&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">&#946;</italic><sub>2</sub><italic toggle="yes">G<sub>t</sub></italic>&#8201;+&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">&#946;<sub>3</sub></italic>t<italic toggle="yes">G<sub>t</sub></italic>&#8201;+&#8201;&#949;<sub>t</sub></disp-formula><p>where &#946;<sub>2</sub> quantifies the level shift following the guideline release, and &#946;<sub>3</sub> (the focal parameter) quantifies the change in slope. An increase in the slope suggests a movement in the trend toward less prescribing, either through reversing an increasing slope or accelerating an already decreasing slope. For example, with a preguideline slope of 1 and a postguideline slope of &#8722;1, the slope change was calculated as 2, implying a reversal of the increasing prescribing trend. Similarly, an increase in the magnitude of a decreasing slope&#8212;for example, if the preguideline slope was &#8722;1 and the postguideline to &#8722;3&#8212;would be calculated as a positive slope change (2, in this case).</p><p>We first descriptively showed changes in the distribution of prescribing levels with histograms of the prescribing outcomes&#8212;at the state level&#8212;at the first time point (January 2012) and the final time point (December 2018). Then, we fit the segmented regression models to each state and mapped the postguideline slope changes for each outcome, to explore geographic variability in the changes. For each outcome, we also quantified and displayed prescribing changes at the national level using the same data, to provide context for the state-level variability. Estimation uncertainty (eg, for confidence intervals) was quantified using Huber-White robust standard errors, which provides, among other things, inference that is robust for potential temporal autocorrelation.

There is previous evidence that, while dispensing rates were already decreasing, the release of the 2016 CDC Guideline corresponded to an acceleration of those decreasing trends,<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230940r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and our results largely corroborate those findings. Across four different dispensing measures, we found broad acceleration of previously existing decreases in dispensing, though magnitude of these changes varied geographically. Specifically, we found changes corresponding to greater decreases universally with regard to long-acting prescribing. Most states (ie, more than 90%) observed changes toward reduced dispensing (eg, an acceleration of an already decreasing slope) in the other 3 outcomes. At the same time, changes corresponding to a shallowing of the decreasing slope were rare. The only example was Florida, which showed a shallowing of the decreasing slope in the high-dose dispensing rate following the 2016 CDC Guideline release. These findings provide further evidence that the 2016 CDC Guideline release coincided to decreases in opioid dispensing, although other cooccurring changes may explain the state-to-state differences.</p><p>Although the 2016 CDC Guideline may have helped to catalyze other secular changes in the opioid policy landscape, there remains great state-to-state heterogeneity, which may explain some of the geographic trends found here. There is documented state-to-state variability in the existence of laws governing opioid prescribing and related factors, including: continuing medical education requirements, pain management clinic policies, laws restricting or prohibiting multiple prescribers, and drug supply management policies.<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> At the same time, by December 2021, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs.<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore, despite state-to-state heterogeneity in the opioid policy landscape, the consistent opioid prescribing practice changes across states found in this report suggested many common threads as well.</p><p>Other state-level factors that may relate to variability in opioid-related outcomes at the state level include pre-2016 CDC Guideline dispensing trends and opioid overdose mortality rates. Indeed, sensitivity analyses showed that baseline (January 2012) rates of long-acting dispensing were correlated with postguideline changes in long-acting prescribing trajectories, though preguideline rates of dispensing were very weakly correlated with postguideline changes in dispensing for the other 3 outcomes. Regarding opioid overdose mortality, within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the age-adjusted opioid overdose death rate per 100&#8201;000 persons varied from 5.3 (Nebraska) to 70.0 (West Virginia)<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> in 2020. Further research is required to determine whether variability in overdose mortality and other opioid-related harms (eg, treatment admissions for opioid use disorder) create differential reactivity to external factors that may change prescribing, such as the 2016 CDC Guideline.</p><sec id="H2-8-ZOI230940"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had several limitations. First, the opioid prescribing policy landscape has evolved considerably since the CDC 2016 Guideline release,<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> including major initiatives such as the 21st Century Cares Act and universal implementation of prescription drug monitoring programs across the country, and so trend changes in opioid prescribing practices may not be solely attributed to the 2016 CDC Guideline. However, it stands to reason that the 2016 CDC Guideline release may have helped to catalyze adjustments in prescription practices, making those types of secular changes and their effects part and parcel of the 2016 CDC Guideline effect. Regardless, the focus of this work was on describing state-to-state heterogeneity in previously identified changes in prescription practices following the 2016 CDC Guideline release, and less on causal attribution. Second, the Xponent administrative database has no patient-level demographic information. Therefore, beyond geographic trends, this data set cannot permit further analysis on demographic variations in opioid prescribing practices. In addition, given changes to the data, analyses could only be conducted through 2018. Lastly, this study focused on dispensing data from retail pharmacies, and as a result it provided no insights on illicit opioid use, an issue that also plays an important role in the opioid overdose epidemic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI230940"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that, while the release of CDC 2016 Guideline was associated with nearly universal reductions in opioid prescribing, there were still notable geographic differences in these changes. These findings highlight state-level trends and variation in prescribing practices over time, which may inform efforts to improve prescribing practices and ultimately reduce opioid-related harms.</p><p>The 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline to Prescribing Opioids for Pain<sup><xref rid="zoi230940r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> updates the 2016 CDC Guideline and the new guideline supports flexible, tailored, patient-centered care to help clinicians work with their patients to provide safe and effective pain care.
