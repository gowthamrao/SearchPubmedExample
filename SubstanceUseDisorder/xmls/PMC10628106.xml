However, the relationship between air pollution and these cancers in regions of low pollution is unclear. We investigated associations between fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide, and black carbon (BC), and both these cancers in a low-pollution city.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cohort of 11,679 men &#8805;65 years old in Perth (Western Australia) were followed from 1996&#8211;1999 until 2018. Pollutant concentrations, as a time-varying variable, were estimated at participants&#8217; residential addresses using land use regression models. Incident lung and bladder cancer were identified through the Western Australian Cancer Registry. Risks were estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models (age as the timescale), adjusting for smoking, socioeconomic status, and co-pollutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Lung cancer was associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC in the adjusted single-pollutant models. A weak positive association was observed between ambient air pollution and squamous cell lung carcinoma but not lung adenocarcinoma. Positive associations were observed with bladder cancer, although these were not statistically significant. Associations were attenuated in two-pollutant models.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Low-level ambient air pollution is associated with lung, and possibly bladder, cancer among older men, suggesting there is no known safe level for air pollution as a carcinogen.</p><p id="Par5">

Mortality data were available from the WA mortality register. Both lung and bladder cancer models were adjusted for baseline area-level SES and smoking status.

Knot locations were determined by the recommendations in Harrell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. When modelling non-linear relationships, it is not appropriate to present a single hazard ratio (HR), as the HR is not constrained to be constant across the exposure range as seen when modelling a linear relationship. As we have modelled the relationship between air pollutants and incident cancers non-linearly, we report HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for multiple pollutant concentrations occurring within the concentration range observed in our study, when compared with a reference, also within our study range.

This suggests that the association of NO<sub>2</sub> with lung cancer is in part reflecting the effects of BC. The HRs were stronger when NO<sub>2</sub> was included in the model with BC, suggesting there may be additive effects.

The follow-up time of 22 years was suitable for lung and bladder cancer, which both have long latency periods. Analysing data from an older-aged cohort is a consideration of a population particularly vulnerable to the health effects of hazardous air pollution. The HIMS is linked to the WADLS and follow-up data for all participants were available through data linkage, including to state hospital records and mortality registry. Reporting cancer diagnoses to the WA Cancer Registry is also a mandatory requirement for WA health practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The WADLS has stringent checking procedures, with low rates of errors in their datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

However, whilst LUR models have been used and validated for back- and forward-extrapolation in previous studies, we did not have validation data to justify the extrapolation of our models for Perth (WA).</p><p id="Par60">The HIMS cohort only included older, mainly Caucasian men, limiting generalisability. Many studies in the literature have used large-scale cohorts (such as populations across multiple countries and sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]), and have drawn from national or state-wide administrative and health surveillance databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These studies include both middle and older-aged adults, and both males and females, resulting in a greater heterogeneity of participants. Female-only studies have also been conducted, such as participants recruited from the Canadian National Breast Screening Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, the HIMS cohort was originally recruited for a randomised screening trial for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and included older-aged men from a single city only.</p><p id="Par61">Although we reported a large number of lung cancer events, the case counts for bladder cancer and histological subtypes of lung cancer were relatively fewer. This could limit the statistical power of these analyses. Whilst our sample size was relatively small compared to other studies, our cohort was a subset of the population most vulnerable to lung (and bladder) cancers. Evaluating lesser-known cancer risk factors such as air pollution was, therefore, suitable and relevant for our cohort.</p><p id="Par62">Pollution estimates were from residential addresses and did not consider where they spent their time.

For example, the UK Biobank Study observed that genetic factors could increase the effect of ambient air pollution on lung cancer by 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Genetic factor analyses were outside the study scope. Finally, confounding was determined at recruitment; hence, lifestyle changes (such as smoking status) during follow-up were not considered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par64">In conclusion, we found an increased risk of lung and possible increase of bladder cancer in a cohort of older men in Perth, WA, residing in areas where ambient air pollution concentrations are typically considered very low. This adds to the increasing evidence that negative health effects are being identified at low concentrations of air pollution. Further studies are needed to understand the carcinogenic potential of ambient air pollution at low concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
