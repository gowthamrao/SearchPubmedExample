Occurring anywhere from one day to one year after childbirth, PPD typically manifests most commonly within one to three weeks postpartum, affecting up to one in seven women. This condition has a wide range of adverse effects on both mothers and their newborns, including disruptions in feeding and sleep patterns. Additionally, affected mothers are less likely to engage in enriching activities with their infants, such as reading, singing, and storytelling [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and may even struggle to respond to their babies' positive cues like smiles. Disturbingly, infants can begin to mirror the depressed behavior of their mothers [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, individuals who have experienced PPD face a significantly higher risk, twice as likely, of developing depression even four years after childbirth and are more prone to chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the precise causes of PPD are multifaceted and not fully elucidated, prior research has identified numerous risk factors that increase a woman's vulnerability. Notably, a history of depression escalates the risk of PPD by 20-fold compared to women with no such history [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While depression history is the most prominent predictor among psychiatric disorders, anxiety also significantly heightens the risk of PPD one year postpartum. Additionally, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and eating disorders demonstrate positive associations with PPD [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Another psychiatric condition linked to PPD is substance use disorder (SUD). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) criteria for SUD encompass a range of symptoms resulting from continued substance use despite adverse consequences, including impaired control, physical dependence, social problems, and risky behavior [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Substances involved can range from alcohol, opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens. Diagnosis of SUD requires a comprehensive evaluation involving self-reports, collateral information from family and friends, physical examinations by physicians, and laboratory tests [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, the percentage of adults aged between 18 and 49 diagnosed with both mental illness and SUD has surged over the past decade [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Substance use disorder was identified as a risk factor for treatment-resistant depression in patients with major depressive disorder [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Lifetime drug use is also correlated with postpartum stress and anxiety [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with those who experienced adverse childhood experiences being notably susceptible to any postpartum psychiatric disorder [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous studies have underscored the association between substance use disorder and PPD, emphasizing the critical role of social networks and support [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other studies have highlighted risk factors like single marital status, tobacco or illegal drug use during pregnancy, and a history of substance abuse in relation to PPD [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite estimates indicating that 8%-11% of pregnant women aged 15 to 44 use illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol monthly, the true extent of the link between SUD and PPD remains challenging to ascertain due to the potential underreporting of maternal substance abuse [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Consequently, this study aims to assess the magnitude of the association between PPD and SUD within a community hospital setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design</p><p>This retrospective study aims to investigate SUD as a risk factor for PPD. Data was collected through a chart review of patients at a community hospital in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Data collection</p><p>Data collection took place between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period. The study population included mothers diagnosed with PPD during this timeframe. The ambulatory Clinical Standards Program Manager of Maternal Child Health and Specialty facilitated data collection.</p><p>Charts of all mothers diagnosed with PPD (identified by billing code F53.0) during the specified period were retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical records (EPIC EMR (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI)). The total number of identified patients diagnosed with PPD during this period was 99.&#160;There were no specific exclusion criteria.&#160;In handling missing data for this study, initially, the dataset was screened for completeness. Each variable of interest, including PPD diagnosis, SUD diagnosis, and demographic information, was examined for missing entries. Records with missing data on key variables (i.e., PPD or SUD diagnosis) were excluded from the final analysis. This ensured that the analysis was conducted only on complete cases, minimizing potential biases introduced by incomplete data.</p><p>Screening for substance use disorder</p><p>Patients with PPD were further screened for co-occurring SUD using relevant diagnostic codes (F10-F19). The substances considered included opioids, alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, and others (unspecified).&#160;</p><p>Demographic and clinical variables</p><p>The extracted data included demographic information (age, postal zip code, ethnicity) and clinical details (date of PPD diagnosis, presence of SUD). The use of medical record numbers (MRNs) ensured data integrity while maintaining patient confidentiality.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>The study employed several statistical methods to assess the relationship between SUD and PPD. First, the prevalence of PPD was calculated for mothers with and without SUD. An odds ratio (OR) was then computed to quantify the strength of the association between SUD and PPD, with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% to estimate the precision of the OR. Additionally, the relative risk (RR) was calculated to compare the risk of developing PPD in mothers with SUD to those without.</p><p>To determine the statistical significance of the observed association, a chi-square test of independence was conducted, comparing the observed frequencies of PPD in mothers with and without SUD. The test generated a chi-square statistic and a corresponding p-value, with a significance level set at 0.05.</p><p>Ethical considerations</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). To protect patient privacy, no identifiable information was used in the analysis. All data were securely stored and processed on hospital computers with encryption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were admitted to the obstetrics unit of this community hospital between 2016 and 2019.

Among the 2,517 deliveries recorded during the study period, the overall prevalence of PPD was 3.93%. The OR was 4.8 and the RR was 4.3. However, when stratified by SUD status, the prevalence of PPD was markedly higher in mothers with SUD at 10.43%, compared to just 2.37% in those without SUD. This disparity was further quantified through the calculation of the OR, which demonstrated that mothers with SUD were approximately 4.8 times more likely to develop PPD than their counterparts without SUD. The RR further supported this association, showing that the risk of developing PPD was 4.4 times higher for mothers with SUD.</p><p>To evaluate the statistical significance of this association, a chi-square test was conducted. The results indicated a chi-square value of 65.67 with an exceedingly low p-value of 5.34&#215;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>, strongly suggesting that the observed association between SUD and PPD is not due to chance. These findings emphasize the need for enhanced screening and early intervention strategies targeting SUD in pregnant and postpartum women to mitigate the elevated risk of PPD and improve maternal and infant health outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to explore the relationship between SUD and PPD within a community hospital setting. The data revealed a significant association between these two conditions, with mothers experiencing SUD exhibiting a markedly higher risk of developing PPD. Specifically, the risk of PPD among mothers with SUD was 10.4%, and the RR was calculated to be 4.3, indicating that these individuals are 4.3 times more likely to develop PPD than those without SUD. The OR of 4.8 further underscores the robustness of this association. This also mirrors other studies, which found an OR of 3.67 between these two variables [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], reinforcing the robustness and consistency of the observed association between SUD and PPD risk. This consistency across studies highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to maternal mental health that integrates substance use screening and intervention strategies.</p><p>Implications of the findings</p><p>The findings from this study emphasize the critical need for comprehensive screening and intervention strategies for PPD and SUD, particularly in community healthcare settings where routine screenings may be limited. Given the significant association between SUD and PPD, integrating mental health assessments into prenatal and postpartum care is essential. Early identification and intervention for women with SUD who are pregnant or planning to conceive can facilitate timely and effective treatments, potentially mitigating the adverse impacts on both maternal and infant well-being [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Limitations</p><p>One notable limitation of this study is the potential underreporting of PPD cases due to the lack of routine screening prior to 2019. This highlights a broader issue in community healthcare settings, where systematic screening for PPD and SUD may not be consistently implemented. Addressing this gap requires systemic changes to healthcare protocols, ensuring that all pregnant and postpartum women undergo comprehensive screenings for these conditions. In addition, our study did not look at other mental health disorders along with SUD that could have affected PPD onset as well.&#160;</p><p>Recommendations for healthcare providers</p><p>Healthcare providers should prioritize the integration of mental health screenings into routine obstetric care. Implementing evidence-based screening protocols for PPD and SUD, especially among vulnerable populations, is crucial. By incorporating these screenings into standard prenatal and postpartum care, healthcare systems can ensure early identification and intervention, which are vital for improving maternal and infant health outcomes. Early detection and appropriate interventions, such as psychotherapy or pharmacological treatments, have been shown to significantly improve health outcomes for both mother and child [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Future research directions</p><p>The study provides valuable demographic data, including age, postal zip code, and ethnicity, which are crucial for understanding the broader context of PPD and SUD. Socioeconomic factors, such as access to healthcare, social support networks, and socioeconomic status, significantly influence the prevalence and management of these conditions. Future research should delve deeper into how these factors affect the risk and management of PPD and SUD, providing a more holistic understanding of the challenges faced by affected women.</p><p>Understanding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the heightened risk of PPD among individuals with SUD is essential for developing effective interventions. The comorbidity of SUD and PPD may be influenced by a range of biological, psychological, and social factors. For instance, substance use can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or create new psychological stressors, leading to a higher likelihood of developing PPD. Additionally, the social stigma and isolation often associated with substance use can further compound mental health challenges [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Future research should explore these mechanisms in greater detail to inform the development of tailored interventions.</p><p>Further research is warranted to explore the complex relationship between SUD and PPD. Longitudinal studies could provide more detailed insights into how these conditions develop and interact over time. Additionally, efforts to develop and test tailored interventions for women with dual diagnoses (SUD and PPD) are needed. Such initiatives can inform evidence-based practices aimed at reducing the burden of maternal mental health disorders within vulnerable populations. Exploring the role of social support networks, access to healthcare, and other socioeconomic factors will be crucial in developing comprehensive strategies to address these co-occurring disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our retrospective study highlights a significant association between substance use disorder&#160;and postpartum depression&#160;in a community hospital setting, with mothers experiencing SUD being 4.3 times more likely to develop PPD. These findings underscore the importance of integrating mental health screenings for PPD and SUD into routine prenatal and postpartum care, especially in community healthcare settings. Early identification and timely interventions can mitigate the adverse effects on maternal and infant health. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms linking SUD and PPD and to develop targeted interventions for women with dual diagnoses. Advancing our understanding of these co-occurring disorders will enhance maternal mental health outcomes and overall well-being.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
