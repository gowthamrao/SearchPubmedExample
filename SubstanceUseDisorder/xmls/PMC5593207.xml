Data from autopsy and toxicology reports and coroner-requested prescribing data from Indiana&#8217;s Prescription Monitoring Program were reviewed. Cause of death and available data were analyzed to identify patterns and trends related to overdose deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Four hundred eighteen drug overdose deaths were identified (336 accidental, 66 intentional, and 16 undetermined). Mean age was 42.5 years, 88.5% were Caucasian, and 68.7% were employed. The majority of deaths occurred at a place of residence (71.4%) and with other people present (57.5% of the time). Depression was the most common comorbidity identified. The most common drug classes identified by toxicology were opioids, followed by benzodiazepines. Significant increases in both heroin (35% of deaths in 2015 versus 8.2% in 2013) and fentanyl (30% of deaths in 2015 versus 2.2% in 2011) were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Drug overdose continues to be a significant cause of death in Allen County. The majority of deaths were accidental and in relatively young, employed individuals. Prevention and awareness strategies should be encouraged, given that the majority of overdose deaths occurred at a place of residence with other people frequently present. Additional concerns about patterns of drug use were confirmed with marked increases in both heroin and fentanyl contributing to overdose deaths in the latter part of the study.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>health outcomes</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>medications</kwd><kwd>pain management</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2333392817727424"><title>Background</title><p>Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> More than half of drug overdose deaths involve the opioid analgesics; 28 647 of the 47 055 drug overdose deaths in 2014 were due to opioids.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although national estimates of drug use prevalence have not changed in recent years, rates of overdose deaths have been steadily increasing in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Since 2000, rates of overdose deaths have increased by over 137%, with a 200% increase from overdose deaths that included opioids.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>

We obtained 2008 to 2015 overdose death records through the ACCO and the Department of Health. Each decedent was assigned an individual study number that was stored in a separate, password-protected file. Any data collected used the individual study number. We conducted chart review of 418 coroner charts for the study years 2008 to 2015 as well as Department of Health death certificates to populate our data collection form. Investigators reviewed coroner&#8217;s reports and files, including narratives, autopsy results (if applicable), toxicology reports, Indiana&#8217;s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program reports when available, and death certificates.

There was an increase in the number of overdose deaths from 2008 to 2015.

The racial breakdown of the deaths showed that 88% were white, 68% of the study population were also employed at the time of their death, and 79.4% had at least a high school education. Multiple substance overdoses account for 74.4% of the deaths (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2333392817727424">Table 2</xref>).

Although rates did moderate somewhat in 2014, the overdose death rate resumed its upward path in 2015 and is comparable with national trends.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This study looked at a variety of additional factors related to overdose deaths including demographics, comorbidities, intentionality by age, and other drug classes present on toxicology evaluation. We also considered the history for increase in use over time of heroin and fentanyl as these relate to overdose deaths. Medical conditions were important pieces of information collected from the coroner&#8217;s case reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2333392817727424">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2333392817727424">2</xref>). This information allowed us to determine whether there were any correlations with specific medical conditions and overdoses. In our study, 46% did not have a medical history in their case reports or a medical condition that was identified from records available to the coroner. The remaining 54% with medical conditions were separated by manner of death (accidental or intentional). A portion of those who intentionally overdosed had conditions such as prior suicide attempts or depression, while those who accidently overdosed more frequently had comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) or chronic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2333392817727424">Figure 1</xref>). An opportunity to alter these negative outcomes may lie in gathering more targeted medical history and then offering treatment to patients with these concerns when they present for medical care.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our data appear to support the importance of follow-up for patients who have a medical history that indicates depression with or without prior suicide attempt, substance abuse disorder, or a chronic pain condition to ensure that appropriate mental health referrals are made.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The need for better appreciation of this information by prescribers was demonstrated in a study of patients diagnosed with SUD who were also prescribed opioids. Of note, there was little change how opioids were prescribed even after a diagnosis of SUD was rendered.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Changing prescribing habits presents an opportunity to reduce mortality risk.</p><p>This study also evaluated whether others were present at the time of the individual&#8217;s overdose death (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2333392817727424">Table 2</xref>). These data were manually extracted by reviewing the circumstances of the individual&#8217;s death from police reports and other logs available in the coroner&#8217;s case file. The presence of others at the time of overdose is encouraging, as it suggests that intervention for these individuals may be possible.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Naloxone (Narcan) is an opioid antagonist that is able to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Mirroring national trends, recent Indiana legislation has increased the availability of naloxone, allowing more individuals to obtain this medication without a prescription. The findings over the entire study period demonstrated that over 57% of the victims had other people present at the time of their overdose. This would suggest that over half of overdose deaths could have potentially been avoided had naloxone been available and administered when needed. When stratifying by age group for overdose death, it was determined that 100% of those who were under the age of 20 had other people present at the time of overdose. Looking at ages up to 50 years, the percentage of individuals who died of overdose with other people present was 70%. Older individuals were less likely to have others present than younger individuals, which might suggest that overdoses occur in a social setting for younger populations. It is important to note that &#8220;individuals present&#8221; refers to another individual&#8217;s presence anywhere in the residence, not specifically in the same room observing the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; individual.</p><p>Study limitations include potential gaps in the completeness of data available through the 2008 to 2013 time period. Incomplete information related to drug classes present and comorbid conditions may have led to underestimation in certain circumstances. For instance, depression, substance abuse, and prior suicide attempts may be underreported, as these conditions were not always reflected in records available for our review.</p><p>The number of intentional and undetermined overdose deaths was relatively consistent from year to year over the course of the study, with benzodiazepines or antidepressants frequently present per toxicology testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333392817727424">Figure 3</xref>). Recent studies have drawn a correlation between opioid use and development of depression, which warrants further investigation.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Several drug classes were identified in our study population, with the most significant of these included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333392817727424">Figure 3</xref>. The 3 most prevalent medication classes/drugs identified were opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Rates of benzodiazepine presence remained relatively level throughout the study period. Opioid presence, including heroin and fentanyl, increased significantly during the latter part of our study, mirroring national trends. Both reached an all-time high in 2015 when over 90% of individuals had opioids in their system and over 35% had fentanyl present. In recent years, fentanyl has been produced illicitly and is commonly combined with heroin, substantially increasing mortality risk of heroin users due to its potency which is 30 to 50 times greater than heroin.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> It is worth noting that all opioids, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, and other formulations, even if prescribed for legitimate use, have the potential to be abused or diverted and present significant abuse potential for those at risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2333392817727424" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p><p>Allen County overdose deaths have dramatically increased since 2008 and have affected mainly employed, educated individuals. This is a significant public health concern involving opioids from both legal and illegal sources. Heroin and illicit fentanyl are increasingly present in these overdose deaths. Possible explanations include new prescribing regulations driving change in physician practice and the relatively lower cost of heroin. Review of prescription drug monitoring programs would provide potential opportunity for identification of prescribing patterns and drug sources. Leveraging this information could further enable the public health community to better identify and target high-risk areas, to develop prevention and intervention strategies, and thereby potentially reverse the trends in overdose death rates.</p><p>Drug overdose deaths doubled from 2008 to 2015, with a progressive increase of opioids present in the overdose deaths. Toxicology reports showed an average of more than 4 drugs in their system, raising polypharmacy concern as a risk factor. The percentage of intentional overdose deaths increased with age, whereas a percentage of accidental overdose deaths decreased with age. Accidental deaths were seen more frequently in people with substance abuse, whereas intentional overdose deaths were seen more often in people with a history of depression. Opioids taken in combination with benzodiazepines or by those with a history of depression may be at the greatest risk of overdose death.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thank you to Marianne Cumming, MD and Hamdeep Singh, MBBS for her substantial assistance in reviewing and editing this document.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2333392817727424"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-2333392817727424"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e88"><title>Author biographies</title><p>
