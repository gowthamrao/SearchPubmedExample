Maintaining enrollment in the programs is challenging, and a large proportion of clients in Washington state (WA) fail to recertify and are disenrolled. In this study we sought to quantify the impact of disenrollment from ADAPs on viral suppression. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 5238 clients in WA ADAP from 2017 to 2019 and estimated the risk difference (RD) of viral suppression before and after disenrollment. We performed a quantitative bias analysis (QBA) to assess the effect of unmeasured confounders, as the factors that contribute to disenrollment and medication discontinuation may overlap. Of the 1336 ADAP clients who disenrolled &#8805;1 time, 83% were virally suppressed before disenrollment versus 69% after (RD 12%, 95%CI 9&#8211;15%). The RD was highest among clients with dual Medicaid-Medicare insurance (RD 22%, 95%CI 9&#8211;35%) and lowest among privately insured individuals (RD 8%, 95%CI 5&#8211;12%). The results of the QBA suggest that unmeasured confounders do not negate the overall RD. The ADAP recertification procedures negatively impact the care of clients who struggle to stay in the program; alternative procedures may reduce this impact.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007813</institution-id><institution>Center for AIDS Research, University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI027757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Khosropour</surname><given-names>Christine M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007813</institution-id><institution>Center for AIDS Research, University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI027757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Dombrowski</surname><given-names>Julia C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>JCD and CMK's work was supported by the University of Washington / Fred Hutch Center for AIDS Research, an NIH-funded program under award number AI027757 which is supported by the following NIH Institutes and Centers: NIAID, NCI, NIMH, NIDA, NICHD, NHLBI, NIA, NIGMS, NIDDK.

ADAPs pay for insurance and medical care for 20% of people living with HIV in the United States, and people on the program have high rates of viral suppression, the central measure of successful HIV treatment [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite the benefits of the program, many PLWH struggle to complete the procedures required to maintain enrollment in the program and subsequently become disenrolled [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285326.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the effect of ADAP disenrollment, particularly temporary disruptions in coverage, on HIV clinical outcomes is unclear.</p><p>In October of 2021, the Federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS program announced that they were removing the federal requirements for client recertification [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Prior to this, recipients of ADAP services needed to provide documentation of their eligibility every 6 months or they would be removed from the program and lose access to services [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This policy was identified as a barrier to client access to ADAPs. In a prior study, we found that 26% of ADAP enrollees in Washington State were disenrolled due to failure to recertify in a 2-year period [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. If they so choose, state programs now have the authority to modify the recertification requirement which may improve retention in the program. However, retaining more clients in the program may increase the cost of the program, and the impact of disenrollment on HIV care has not been established.</p><p>There is evidence to suggest that disenrollment from ADAP may disrupt access to antiretroviral medications and HIV medical care. A 2018 HRSA request for information from Ryan White programs, clients, and providers identified the 6-month recertification requirement as a disruptor to HIV care [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Changes to insurance coverage have been demonstrated to be disruptive to ART use; a 2016 study found that PLWH who lose insurance were less likely to be virally suppressed [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285326.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A loss of ADAP coverage may occur at a particularly vulnerable time for clients; if a person is unable to complete the recertification procedures, it may indicate that they have a reduced capacity to navigate medical and payer systems. To our knowledge there is no published data examining the effect of ADAP disenrollment on viral suppression or how this may be modified by a client&#8217;s existing insurance coverage.</p><p>In this study we examined the change in viral suppression associated with ADAP disenrollment. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Compare the risk of viral suppression between those who disenroll in ADAP or are ruled ineligible for ADAP and those who are continuously enrolled; 2) Estimate the risk differences by co-insurance type; and 3) Describe the potential effect of confounding by mental health, binge-drinking, illicit substance use, and homelessness on the measured risk difference using quantitative bias analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and data sources</title><p>We performed a longitudinal analysis of PLWH enrolled in Washington State&#8217;s ADAP between 2017 and 2019. To be eligible for inclusion in our analysis, ADAP clients had to either be continuously enrolled in ADAP until the end of 2019, receive a viral load in Washington state within 12 months of leaving ADAP, or live in Washington state for 12 months after leaving ADAP. Residency in Washington state was inferred from subsequent laboratory reports or interstate deduplication efforts based on Soundex that occur when a person has not received a lab in Washington for 18 months.</p><p>The primary data sources were Washington HIV surveillance system and the Washington Ryan White Data System. The Washington HIV surveillance system is a longitudinal database of PLWH based on laboratory results collected during the course of routine HIV care and reported to the state by law [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The laboratory results are supplemented by active collection of additional information about new HIV diagnoses, changes of residence, death, and demographics which yields a data system that can be used to describe the population of PLWH in Washington and follow individuals&#8217; clinical outcomes over time. The Ryan White data system is an administrative database of eligibility, benefits, and services provided for all Ryan White-funded activities in Washington State that is used for claims administration, eligibility determination, enrollment, program administration, and program evaluation.</p><p>The exposure of interest was recertification success, which we measured using data from the Ryan White data system. We characterized each client&#8217;s recertification success over the study period by categorizing them as 1) continuously enrolled (i.e. the client successfully recertified throughout the two year time period), 2) disenrolled (i.e. the client failed to recertify one or more times), or 3) ineligible (i.e. the client submitted recertification information but did not meet the requirements for the program one or more times). More information about how clients were categorized is described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. If a client was both disenrolled and ruled ineligible during the study period, they were assigned the status corresponding to the event that occurred first.</p><p>Our outcome was viral suppression status before and after clients&#8217; recertification opportunities, which we measured using data from the HIV surveillance system. Viral suppression is the central indicator of successful treatment of HIV and represents a health state with a reduced risk of HIV-associated illness and no risk of HIV transmission [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is assessed via viral load testing, which is generally performed every 6 to 12 months for PLWH in continuous care. We measured viral suppression before a recertification opportunity by the result of a client&#8217;s last viral load test before the recertification date and measured viral suppression after a recertification opportunity by the result of the viral load test immediately following their recertification date. We used a cutoff of 200 viral copies per milliliter and considered clients to be not suppressed if they did not have a viral load test in the 12 months preceding or following a recertification [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>To characterize the demographics of our population, we extracted age, race and ethnicity, sex at birth, HIV acquisition risk (male sex with male, injection drug use, male sex with male and injection drug use, heterosexual contact, and other), and region (Western Washington, Eastern Washington, or Seattle/King County) from the HIV surveillance system and insurance type (private, dual Medicare-Medicaid, other public insurance, uninsured) and enrollment in case management from the Ryan White data system. For insurance type, &#8220;other public insurance&#8221; primarily consists of Medicare plans, but also includes VA and Indian Health Service coverage. Individuals with Medicaid are generally not eligible for ADAP (apart from those with dual Medicare-Medicaid).

recertification opportunity to the model; although individual clients may have encountered multiple recertification opportunities during our study period, we chose to analyze only a single event to ensure that we did not re-use individual viral load test results across observations. For clients categorized as disenrolled or ineligible, we modelled viral suppression surrounding the date they were first disenrolled or ruled ineligible. For clients who were continuously enrolled, we modelled viral suppression surrounding their first successful recertification. We constructed adjusted models that included age (linear splines with cut points at 25, 50, and 75), sex, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission category, region, insurance type, and case management status. As the value of ADAP services may depend on a client&#8217;s ability to afford care via other means, we repeated our analyses with an interaction term between the disenrollment and ineligibility terms and insurance type to estimate risk differences specific to insurance type. This was an a priori decision. We also performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded clients who did not have a viral load before or after their recertification opportunity of interest. (In primary analyses we categorized individuals who did not have labs as not virally suppressed). This was motivated by concern about individuals moving out of Washington; laboratory results for someone who has moved away would not be reported to the Washington State Department of Health and can give the appearance that the person is not receiving medical care. This may be overrepresented among people who disenroll, as people who leave the state likely would not apply for ADAP recertification. To quantify the impact of this analytic decision, we repeated our analysis while excluding clients who did not have a viral load before or after their recertification opportunity of interest. We also described the median and quartiles of number of months between viral load testing and recertification opportunity and the percent of clients who had zero, one, and 2 or more viral load tests before and after their recertification opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Quantitative bias analysis</title><p>Quantitative bias analysis is a technique for describing the influence of systematic error on an epidemiologic study&#8217;s estimand of association [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our study, we used quantitative bias analysis to examine the impact of unmeasured confounders. When individual-level confounder information is not available, quantitative bias analysis can be used to simulate adjusted estimates using descriptions of population characteristics from external data sources. Through review of the literature and consultation of HIV care providers, we identified four variables that we could not measure directly for the entire analytic sample, but may be confounders of the association between ADAP disenrollment and viral suppression: poor mental health [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], heavy drinking [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], illicit substance use [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and housing instability [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To develop adjusted estimates three parameters are required: 1.) the risk difference of viral suppression between those who were exposed to each confounder and those who were not exposed to each confounder among those who were in ADAP, 2.) the prevalence of the confounders among those who remained enrolled in ADAP, and 3.) the prevalence of the confounders among those who disenrolled from ADAP (<xref rid="pone.0285326.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To estimate these parameters, we used data collected from current or former ADAP clients who participated in the Washington Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) between 2015 and 2018. MMP is a surveillance system that captures detailed information on behavioral and clinical characteristics of a sample of people living with HIV in the US via structured phone interview and medical record abstraction [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The data is collected by health department staff, who are assigned a random sample of PLWH to contact via letter and phone call. The data is accompanied by weights to correct for non-response bias.

For parameter 3, we simulated a range of values ranging from 0% to 100% higher than parameter 2. We used these 3 parameters together to calculate corrected risk differences using the methodology described in Lash et al. [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

This effect was largest among clients who had dual Medicaid/Medicare insurance (22/100) and smallest among clients who had private insurance (8/100). Our quantitative bias analysis showed that the barriers to viral suppression of housing instability, poor mental health, binge-drinking, and illicit substance use partially explain but do not entirely account for the effect. This suggest that loss of ADAP coverage has a direct effect on reducing viral suppression.</p><p>The large drop in the proportion virally suppressed for those who are disenrolled from the program suggest that a subset of clients who are removed from ADAP are left without a way to access medications. This is consistent with ADAP&#8217;s role as a &#8217;last resort&#8217; payer and a survey of PLWH in Alabama, of whom 21% had lapses in treatment due to problems with ADAP or medication costs [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The larger effect sizes among individuals with dual Medicare/Medicaid (who necessarily have a disability) and uninsured individuals (who may have to pay full price for medical care) are consistent with a situation where a subset of the clients who are disenrolled do not have the resources to continue accessing HIV care. It is noteworthy that there was also significant decrease in viral suppression among those who were ruled ineligible from ADAP. This population is presumed to have alternative mechanisms to pay for healthcare (an income&gt;425% FPL or Medicaid), but these results suggest that disruption of or change to medical coverage may still adversely impact this population.</p><p>Our quantitative bias analysis demonstrates that the major barriers to care that we measured (mental health, substance use, and housing instability) are not sufficient to explain the associations we observed, unless the prevalence of these factors are more than twice as high among those who are disenrolled as those who are not. This would require an extremely high prevalence of certain comorbidities among those who disenroll (e.g. over 78% homelessness and 32% illicit substance use in the past 12 months) which seems unlikely. Our findings provide evidence that disenrollment is a direct cause of clients falling out of HIV care, rather than simply a consequence of the same barriers that cause PLWH to fall out of HIV care or stop antiretroviral medications. This is consistent with responses to the HRSA request for information about the Ryan White program&#8217;s administrative burdens, where program staff and HIV care providers described the recertification requirement as a barrier to keeping clients in care, and with literature that found insurance changes to be disruptive to HIV care more generally [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285326.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Our study had several limitations. The first is related to our measurement of viral suppression. Some people who have left Washington state or who only require infrequent viral load monitoring as may be misclassified as virally unsuppressed. However, our sensitivity analysis that includes only people who have labs reported in Washington confirms the presence of a risk difference even in a situation where this misclassification is not possible. The variables used in our quantitative bias analysis are imperfect measures and come from a data source (MMP) that may rely on a biased sample. As such there likely is residual confounding or additional confounders that bias our estimates. However, it would require a very strong confounder or many additional weak confounders to explain the entire remaining effect after controlling for variables in our analysis. Finally, it is possible that some clients who do not recertify choose not to do so because they know that they are ineligible. However, this would only serve to attenuate the risk difference among those disenrolled, as it would cause clients in our study who are ineligible to be misclassified as disenrolled.</p><p>The generalizability of these findings to other ADAP programs depend on the similarity of their ADAP benefits and the care alternatives for people who leave ADAP. Washington&#8217;s ADAP offers a wider range of services than many other state ADAP programs, some of which can pay for little more than direct HIV care [<xref rid="pone.0285326.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the range of services in Washington undoubtedly contribute to clients&#8217; ability to achieve viral suppression, it also means that some clients in Washington ADAP may only enroll in ADAP for supplemental services. This suggests that disenrollment from ADAP in other states could have a larger impact on viral suppression, as in some cases every client would experience changes to their access to ART, rather than only the portion of clients in Washington who use HIV prescription benefits. Further, Washington is a Medicaid expansion state, which means that the lowest income populations in the state are in Medicaid rather than ADAP. In non-expansion states, where it is more difficult to enroll in Medicaid, ADAP may be serving populations that have fewer resources to accommodate disenrollment. Taken together, this suggests that the impact of disenrollment on viral suppression may be the same or larger in other jurisdictions.</p><p>We found that in Washington State, a significant proportion of PLWH who were removed from ADAP due to failure to recertify lost viral suppression immediately afterwards. This suggests that the default 6-month recertification policy serves as a barrier to achieving federal goals for HIV incidence and to the health of PLWH generally. In light of these findings, we recommend that ADAP programs make use of the new flexibility in federal recertification policy and examine alternatives to the 6-month recertification requirement that improve retention in their programs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0285326.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America</collab>. <source>Center for Disease Control and Prevention;</source><year>2019</year><month>Jun</month>.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Thank you for the opportunity to review. The authors provide a careful analysis of changes in HIV viral suppression after disenrollment from Washington State&#8217;s AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The findings are directly relevant to policy, following the October 2021 removal of federal requirements that clients recertify every 6 months. The writing is clear and the quantitative bias analysis using the MMP data enhances the results. I have a few suggestions for the authors as they revise their work.</p><p>First, please add a &#8220;Table 1&#8221; of descriptives of the main study sample. Some of this information is in Supplementary Table 1. I recommend moving that to the main text and adding a column to provide descriptives on the full sample. In the Supplementary Table 1, the prevalence ratio is less intuitive for illustrating the differences between the two groups. As your reader, I am unsure how to interpret this column to quickly understand how characteristics differ between groups. Is there an easier way to present p-values showing differences between groups? If you prefer this format, please explain in the footnote and text how to interpret.</p><p>Second, I recommend a flow chart or other visualization to explain the sample design. Starting on line 136, the authors explain that each client contributed one recertification opportunity. If recertification were required every 6 months during the study period (per federal rules in place during the 2017-2019 study period), a client could potentially contribute multiple observations. It would be useful to have a better understanding of the time period of the study (are most observations from 2017 in the initial event?) and explanation for only considering one observation per study participant.</p><p>Third, a challenge with the HIV VL data is that in practice, VL testing is not always done precisely every 6 months. The VL tests can be missing for multiple reasons: falling out of care (which the authors code as not virally suppressed), having the tests done out of state and not reported to Washington&#8217;s surveillance system (for example, for persons who spend winter months in a different state), or because the patient is stable on their medications thereby receiving less frequent VL testing than the clinical guidelines (a comment I have heard anecdotally from clinicians). The authors already have a sensitivity analysis that excludes participants without a VL measurement before or after recertification. It would be useful to have more details on the timing of VL measurements in the data such as the percent of participants with 1+ or 2+ VL tests per year, the average and range in the time in between disenrollment &amp; recertification events and VL testing, and comparison of sub-populations with and without regular VL testing. Please also discuss in the limitations how the timing of VL tests in relation to the time of recertification &amp; disenrollment events might bias findings.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;In this manuscript, the authors link data from the Washington State ADAP program with Washington State HIV surveillance data to understand the impact of disenrollment on viral suppression among ADAP enrollees between 2017 to 2019. They found that disenrollment was associated with a 12% decrease in viral suppression compared with continuous ADAP enrollment. They also found differences in the change in viral suppression by insurance status, with dual Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries and those with &#8220;other public insurance&#8221; the most affected by disenrollment. Based on their findings, they conclude that disenrollment negatively impacts viral suppression and that simplifying or eliminating ADAP recertification may help to improve viral suppression among ADAP enrollees.</p><p>This is a well-written paper using unique datasets to answer an important policy question: what is the effect of ADAP disenrollment on viral suppression in Washington State? This question has not been addressed in the literature to date, making this both a unique and timely paper given the removal of federal requirements for ADAP client recertification in October 2021.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. I appreciate the use of the risk difference to quantify the attributable risk of viral suppression due to lack of recertification. This is not used often enough for population-based studies such as this one.</p><p>2. Methods, lines 84-87: The inclusion criteria as described for this study is a little confusing. How is it known whether a client lives in Washington State for 12 months after leaving ADAP if they drop out of care? Is there active follow-up of those who drop out? Since this analysis uses surveillance data, it would seem that the residency status (Washington residence versus another state) of someone who disenrolls and does not have any contact with the providers in Washington State for over a year would be difficult to ascertain.</p><p>3. In addition to the important message about disenrollment and viral suppression, there may be a message about ineligibility and viral suppression worth mentioning in the Discussion, since those who became ineligible for ADAP also had substantial decreases in suppression (albeit in a smaller subset). However, some additional context may be necessary to better understand this (see my minor comment #1 below).</p><p>4. The comment in the Discussion that Washington is a Medicaid expansion state is an important one given that the inferences identified here could be exacerbated in a non-Medicaid expansion state. In fact, based on Table 1, &#8220;other public insurance&#8221; is the second largest group after &#8220;private insurance&#8221;. Can the authors clarify what type of insurance this is? Is it mostly Medicaid beneficiaries?</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Is there information on what the reasons for disenrollment and/or ineligibility among ADAP enrollees in Washington State, and how they are distributed? E.g., how often do ADAP clients lose eligibility because they obtain health insurance through a new job? Some context may be helpful to include in the Discussion if this information is available (although it may not be available).</p><p>2. Introduction, first sentence: The authors state that ADAPs are &#8220;a critical part of federal plans to reduce HIV incidence by 90% by 2030&#8221;. One assumes that this is because of the concept of &#8220;treatment as prevention&#8221; &#8211; this could be made clearer.</p><p>3. Introduction, line 60: The authors note that &#8220;individual programs now have the authority to modify the recertification requirement&#8221;. It would be helpful to insert the word &#8220;state&#8221; before the word &#8220;programs&#8221; to clarify and emphasize that ADAPs are administered by states.</p><p>4. Methods, line 107: if multiple VLs are recorded for a client before and after recertification opportunities, which ones are used in the analysis?</p><p>5. Methods, line 108: the word &#8220;is&#8221; is missing after &#8220;Viral suppression&#8221;</p><p>6. Methods, line 109: the word &#8220;of&#8221; is missing after &#8220;reduced risk&#8221;</p><p>7. Methods, line 156: consider replacing the word &#8220;estimate&#8221; with &#8220;estimand&#8221;</p><p>8. Methods, lines 171-172.

Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>3.
