Less is known about the risk of PTB in offspring of fathers with psychiatric diagnoses, and for couples where both parents were diagnosed. In a nationwide birth cohort, we examined the association between psychiatric history in fathers, mothers, and both parents and gestational age.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We included all infants live-born to Nordic parents in 1997 to 2016 in Sweden. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the National Patient Register. Data on gestational age were retrieved from the Medical Birth Register. Associations between parental psychiatric history and PTB were quantified by relative risk (RR) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from log-binomial regressions, by psychiatric disorders overall and by diagnostic categories. We extended the analysis beyond PTB by calculating risks over the whole distribution of gestational age, including &#8220;early term&#8221; (37 to 38 weeks).</p><p>Among the 1,488,920 infants born throughout the study period, 1,268,507 were born to parents without a psychiatric diagnosis, of whom 73,094 (5.8%) were born preterm. 4,597 of 73,500 (6.3%) infants were born preterm to fathers with a psychiatric diagnosis, 8,917 of 122,611 (7.3%) infants were born preterm to mothers with a pscyhiatric diagnosis, and 2,026 of 24,302 (8.3%) infants were born preterm to both parents with a pscyhiatric diagnosis. We observed a shift towards earlier gestational age in offspring of parents with psychiatric history. The risks of PTB associated with paternal and maternal psychiatric diagnoses were similar for different psychiatric disorders. The risks for PTB were estimated at RR 1.12 (95% CI [1.08, 1.15] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for paternal diagnoses, at RR 1.31 (95% CI [1.28, 1.34] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for maternal diagnoses, and at RR 1.52 (95% CI [1.46, 1.59] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) when both parents were diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder, compared to when neither parent had a psychiatric diagnosis. Stress-related disorders were associated with the highest risks of PTB with corresponding RRs estimated at 1.23 (95% CI [1.16, 1.31] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for a psychiatry history in fathers, at 1.47 (95% CI [1.42, 1.53] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for mothers, and at 1.90 (95% CI [1.64, 2.20] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for both parents. The risks for early term were similar to PTB. Co-occurring diagnoses from different diagnostic categories increased risk; for fathers: RR 1.10 (95% CI [1.07, 1.13] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), 1.15 (95% CI [1.09, 1.21] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 1.33 (95% CI [1.23, 1.43] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), for diagnoses in 1, 2, and &#8805;3 categories; for mothers: RR 1.25 (95% CI [1.22, 1.28] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), 1.39 (95% CI [1.34, 1.44] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 1.65 (95% CI [1.56, 1.74] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Despite the large sample size, statistical precision was limited in subgroups, mainly where both parents had specific psychiatric subtypes. Pathophysiology and genetics underlying different psychiatric diagnoses can be heterogeneous.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Paternal and maternal psychiatric history were associated with a shift to earlier gestational age and increased risk of births before full term.

Although frequently attributed to environmental (antenatal distress, elevated neuro-endocrine activity, and homeostasis disruptions) [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and genetic causes [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], critical knowledge gaps remain. First, the association between maternal psychiatric history and preterm delivery has not been extensively studied across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. One recent systematic review correlated mental illness before delivery with pregnancy complications including preterm delivery, with most evidence from depression and anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rather, most previous studies have generally focused on mood and anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with other psychiatric disorders receiving less attention [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because these studies have typically relied on modest sample sizes and yielded mixed results, a comprehensive examination across different psychiatric disorders in a large population is required. Second, the association between paternal psychiatric history and preterm delivery has rarely been studied [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and a rigorous study addressing the combined effect of psychiatric disorders in couples is notably absent. To understand the underlying mechanisms, it is essential to disentangle psychiatric history contributions in mothers from fathers. Third, evidence suggests that even moderately shorter gestation, as 1 or 2 weeks before full term, is associated with neonatal morbidity [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and future health outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. How the risk of preterm delivery in offspring of parents with psychiatric diagnoses extends to the entire range of gestational age is largely unknown, particularly at early term (37 to 38 weeks). We are only aware of one study that has examined the risk of birth before full term for several psychiatric disorders in mothers [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. No studies have examined changes in distribution of gestational age for paternal psychiatric disorders and shift of gestational age in preterm and early term births.

Fathers were identified by linkage to the Swedish Multigeneration Register (MGR). Data on parental education (completed school years) and income were extracted from the Swedish government&#8217;s database for health insurance and labor market studies (LISA database) [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Psychiatric diagnoses from specialist care were extracted from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (inpatient diagnoses since 1973 and nationwide coverage of outpatient diagnoses since approximately 2001). The data quality of the NPR has been verified [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and validated for diagnoses of psychiatric conditions [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Data on vital status and emigration was derived from the Total Population Register. Individual-level data from different registers were linked using the Swedish unique personal identity number of each citizen.

We divided psychiatric disorders in 6 diagnostic categories: psychoactive substance use, schizophrenia and other non-mood psychotic disorder, mood disorders, neurotic/behavioral disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders (including emotional and behavioral disorders of childhood origin and intellectual disability), and other psychiatric disorder (not otherwise specified). Several subtypes under the diagnostic categories were further examined, including depression, bipolar, anxiety, obsessive&#8211;compulsive disorder (OCD), stress-related disorders, somatoform, and eating disorders. Individuals with several types of psychiatric diagnoses can contribute to different diagnostic categories.</p><p>Gestational age in days was collected from the MBR. Since 1990, early second-trimester ultrasound examination is routinely offered to determine gestational age, and more than 95% of women accepted this offer; otherwise, the date of last menstrual period is used [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We categorized gestational age into preterm (&lt;37 weeks) and term (&#8805;37 weeks) birth and then further into very preterm (&lt;32 weeks), moderate to late preterm (32 to 36 weeks), early term (37 to 38 weeks), and full term (&#8805;39 weeks) [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We classified deliveries as spontaneous and non-spontaneous, i.e., spontaneous initiation of labor, or through induction of labor or cesarean section, according to the record of onset of labor in the MBR.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Other covariates</title><p>Birth year, sex, maternal age, maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), maternal body mass index (BMI) at the first prenatal visit (&lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 25 to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, &#8805;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and onset of delivery (spontaneous versus non-spontaneous delivery) were obtained from the MBR. Paternal age and parental yearly income (Swedish Krona, SEK) and level of education (&lt;9 years primary education, 9 years primary education, 1 to 2 years secondary education, 3 years secondary education, 1 to 2 years postgraduate education, &#8805;3 years postgraduate education, PhD education) were defined at delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To address potential changes in the full gestational age distribution, without dichotomizing the data, we showed the shape of the gestational age distribution for the different exposure groups by calculating probability density functions. A density curve provides a visualization of what percentage of observations in the gestational age distribution fall between different values (here: gestational weeks). Next, we fitted quantile regression models adjusting for offspring&#8217;s birth year (categorized in 5-year intervals) to examine the effects of exposures at different quantiles. Whereas a linear regression analyses differences in the mean between exposures, quantile regression can compare exposures at an arbitrary cutoff of a data distribution, e.g., at the 1st, 5th, or 10th percentiles, and study effects on the most sensitive lower tail of the gestational age distribution. Thus, for the analysis of gestational age, quantile regression can estimate at which gestational age (week) the 1%, 5%, or 10% earliest born children were delivered and how this age differs between exposures.</p><p>We quantified the association between parental psychiatric history and preterm birth by relative risks (RRs) and associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from log-binomial regression models. In primary analyses, we examined any psychiatric diagnosis present in both parents, only in mothers and only in fathers separately, adjusted for offspring birth year as natural cubic splines with 5 degrees of freedom (Model 1) [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We then examined the risk by 6 psychiatric diagnostic categories and by subtypes within each categories. Forest plots were created to depict the trends of RRs by different psychiatric diagnoses in the parents. We repeated the analyses in finer categories of gestational age, including very preterm, moderate/late preterm, early term, and full term, with risks quantified by odds ratio (OR) from multinomial logistic regression. We examined the preterm risk in relation to the number of co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses in different diagnostic categories, by diagnoses in 1, 2, or &#8805;3 categories, in mothers and fathers separately.</p><p>All statistical tests were performed on the two-sided 5% level of significance. To address potential correlation between siblings, robust standard errors were applied [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We did not adjust the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values for multiplicity of statistical tests. However, the primary research question may be addressed by using only 3 sequential statistical tests (psychiatric history in both parents, only in mothers and only in fathers, versus in neither parent).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Supplementary analyses</title><p>(1) We fitted a sequence of models adjusting for paternal and maternal age, education, and income as well as maternal BMI in early pregnancy and smoking during pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Since these factors may influence the associations, not only as confounders between psychiatric diagnosis and gestational age, but also as modifiers and/or mediators, adjustment in regression analysis may introduce unknown biases; therefore, we did not include them in the primary analysis (Model 1; only including birth year as covariate). Still, to explore if these covariates provide any major influences on the association without resolving their exact potential roles as confounders, mediators, or modifiers, we adjusted for them in supplementary models. In Model 2, we adjusted for covariates related with both maternal and paternal psychiatric diagnosis, including maternal and paternal age (as natural cubic splines), level of education and income (modeled by ranks as natural cubic splines) at delivery. Next, in Model 3, we further adjusted for maternal-specific covariates, including maternal smoking and BMI. (2) We performed pairwise comparisons between psychiatric exposure groups, comparing risk of preterm delivery associated with psychiatric history in both parents to only in fathers, only in mothers to only in fathers, and in both parents to only in mothers. (3) We stratified analyses by spontaneous delivery and non-spontaneous. (4) We estimated the preterm risk separately by offspring sex and by including an interaction term between psychiatric history and sex. (5) We restricted the analyses to singletons. (6) To examine the specificity of timing of the diagnosis, we restricted the analysis to parental psychiatric disorders first diagnosed prior to 2 years before conception. (7) To determine the extent to which the results were driven by individuals with provisional diagnoses, i.e., only 1 single diagnosis in an individual or diagnoses given over a short period of time, we repeated the main analysis but excluded parental psychiatric diagnoses recorded only once in the patient register or some diagnoses within 30 days. (8) We restricted the population to births from 2005 onwards.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, United States of America).

Only 10,749 (0.7%) had missing data on covariates (gestational age, sex, parental income and education) and were excluded from the analyses. Thus, our analytic cohort comprised 1,488,920 infants (Fig A in <xref rid="pmed.1004256.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). A total of 1,268,507 infants were born to parents without a psychiatric diagnosis, of whom 73,094 (5.8%) were born preterm. A total of 4,597 of 73,500 (6.3%) infants were born preterm to fathers with a psychiatric diagnosis, 8,917 of 122,611 (7.3%) infants were born preterm to mothers with a psychiatric diagnosis, and 2,026 of 24,302 (8.3%) infants were born preterm to both parents with a psychiatric diagnosis. The median lag years between the first observed diagnosis and the date of delivery was 7 years (interquartile range (IQR): 4 to 13 years) in fathers and 6 years (IQR: 3 to 11 years) in mothers; the corresponding years for the last observed diagnosis was 2 years (IQR: 0.6 to 6 years) in fathers and 2 years (IQR: 0.6 to 5 years) in mothers.

For example, the lowest 5% of the data are found below the fifth percentile. For each psychiatric diagnostic category, the quantile regression models examined the effects of exposures at each different percentile of GA, comparing GA for births of mothers, fathers, and both parents with psychiatric diagnosis, to that of neither parent with psychiatric diagnosis, adjusted for offspring&#8217;s birth year in 5-year interval. The quantile regression estimates the shift of GA at the lower tails of the GA distribution, i.e., the most sensitive periods of preterm and early term births.

In this nationwide birth cohort study spanning over 20 years, including 1.5 million births, we observed a shift towards earlier gestational age in offspring of parents with a history of psychiatric diagnosis, particularly at lower quantiles of gestational age corresponding to preterm and early term births. Consequently, the risks of preterm and early term birth were increased, with increased risk when only fathers had a psychiatric history, even higher risks when only mothers had a psychiatric history and highest for psychiatric history in both parents, compared to neither parent with psychiatric history. One dose-dependent pattern was seen with increasing number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders from different diagnostic categories in fathers and mothers. After adjustment for parental age and socioeconomic status and maternal BMI and smoking, the risk was largely similar for maternal associations but was noticeably reduced for paternal associations, although it remained statistically significant. The preterm risk was higher among spontaneous deliveries, compared to non-spontaneous deliveries. There were no sex-specific differences in risk.</p><p>Strengths of our study include the large population-based cohort design, with prospective ascertainment of psychiatric diagnoses assigned by specialists and gestational age determined using ultrasound. Selection bias was minimized by utilizing data from a publicly financed health care system with universal access and close to complete follow-up. Compared to earlier studies, our sample size and detailed database enabled us to examine risks associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders in one population and to examine, to the best of our knowledge, the additive effect of maternal and paternal exposure for the first time.</p><p>Our study also have several limitation. Despite the large sample size, statistical precision was limited in subgroups, mainly where both parents had specific psychiatric subtypes. Although we examined the risk by diagnostic categories and subtypes of psychiatric disorders, pathophysiology and genetics underlying different categories can still be very heterogeneous. We do not have data on psychiatric diagnoses set in primary care, which excludes subclinical conditions. Possibly these individuals can introduce measurement errors that could result in, if anything, underestimating the actual associations. We do not have information on disease severity and activity during pregnancy. However, we examined the co-occurrence of several psychiatric diagnoses as an indicator of disease load. Future studies will have to address the potential impact of psychiatric medications or other types of treatment. Finally, we cannot rule out residual confounding, e.g., due to maternal infection or other unknown factors, as well as bias due to fetal death, miscarriage, or abortion at extremely early gestational age range.</p><p>This is, as far as we know, the first large population-based study to comprehensively examine the full gestational range by psychiatric diagnoses for both the parents. Importantly, the increased risk was present not only for the 5% of the offspring born preterm, but also for the larger group of offspring born at early term&#8212;in Sweden approximately 20% of all births, and remained consistent across different psychiatric disorders. There is a growing literature supporting the importance of delivery in the optimal biological window around week 40. For example, morbidity and mortality are elevated not only for infants born preterm, but also for infants born &#8220;early term&#8221; [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which opens a larger pathway of risk associated with gestational age, not only for a small subset of the population. Only 1 study examined the risk of birth before full term. It included only mothers with psychiatric disorders but reported an increased risk of births before 39 weeks, consistent with our finding of an increased risk of births at early term between 37 and 38 weeks [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Two earlier studies on prenatal paternal depression and schizophrenia suggested paternal depression as a risk factor for preterm birth [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but not for paternal schizophrenia [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, we observed increased risk of preterm birth in cases of any paternal psychiatric diagnosis and by a wide range of psychiatric diagnostic categories. Increased risk of preterm delivery in mothers with a psychiatric history has been reported in several studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The present study supported earlier findings and extended previous data by examining risks in 13 diagnostic categories/subtypes. Our results are in line with studies reporting higher preterm risks with maternal mood and anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], stress-related disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], eating disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], substance use [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], schizophrenia [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and OCD [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Our results show a consistent risk pattern across different psychiatric diagnoses and gestational weeks. The underlying pathophysiology behind the observed association is complex. The risk of preterm birth is more pronounced in spontaneous than in non-spontaneous delivery. Stress and inflammation/infection are main causes of spontaneous preterm and interact with genetic susceptibility [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Maternal stress is also regarded as an important link between maternal psychiatric disorders and preterm birth through endocrine, behavioral, and/or inflammation/immune-mediated mechanisms [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Suffering from a psychiatric condition, or having a partner with a psychiatric condition during pregnancy, may be challenging to the mother. Increased psychological stress has been linked to higher levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, which may induce premature uterus contractions [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Accordingly, the highest point estimates for risk of preterm birth is observed for paternal and maternal stress-related disorders. In addition, 2 meta-analyses show that paternal depression is associated with maternal depression [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Studies have identified factors such as violence, substance abuse, and smoking as important mediators for poor obstetric outcomes, including preterm delivery, in women with severe mental illness [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is possible that the same social and environmental disadvantages that predispose to preterm birth cluster in couples in which both have mental illness [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis demonstrates that unemployment and financial strain are important risk factors for paternal depression [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In line with this, we found that adjustment for parental education, income, and age at delivery decreased risks associated with paternal psychiatric history but risk estimates remained essentially unchanged for maternal psychiatric history. This may indicate the involvement of environmental/social factors in the pathway between parental psychiatric history and preterm births, particularly for paternal associations. Still, genetic causes are the main drivers of risk for psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric disorders are among the most heritable diseases [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is evidence for genetic components and gene&#8211;environment interactions in spontaneous preterm birth [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and it is not clear if these are also associated with psychiatric conditions. It is possible that, through shared genetic or environmental factors, parents who carry genetic risk for psychiatric disorders may also carry a higher liability for preterm delivery. In our study, the risk of preterm birth increased with number of different psychiatric disorders in a parent. This dose&#8211;response relationship may also indicate that higher disease load, either genetic load or as a measure of disease severity, is linked to magnitude of the risk of preterm delivery. Consequently, if genetic, the pattern with lower association in fathers than in mothers suggests a risk driven by interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures; the genetic risk may in turn be modified by socioeconomic risks and other gene&#8211;environmental interactions [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>At least 15% of couples giving birth in Sweden had a history of psychiatric diagnosis(es), which implies a substantial potential for public health initiatives. Paternal involvement during pregnancy has been shown to moderate maternal stress, and the lack of such paternal support is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004256.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, such psychological support may be lacking in which both members of the couple have psychiatric conditions. Linking psychological stressors with increased risk of preterm birth, factors such as social and environmental disadvantages are likely to cluster and psychological support to counteract such stress is more likely to be adversely affected in families were both parents have mental conditions. This raises the concern about preventive efforts in antenatal care and opens possibilities for clinical intervention, e.g., whether additional social support to these families may be needed. Causally, if we speculate that inherited genetic risk as well as &#8220;biological&#8221; or &#8220;psychological&#8221; stress can carry over to other populations, the results are generalizable beyond Sweden. However, risk from downstream factors, e.g., obesity and smoking, as well as public health interventions may differ between countries and populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"

Definitely good to send manuscript back to authors with a Major Revision decision.</p><p>My only additional comment might be to ask the authors to speak a little bit more about mechanism. How might father+mother psychiatric history increase risk over that of just one of them (for example). Authors speak a bit about gene-environment interaction as a mechanism, but it is brief and not entirely convincing. Without a careful consideration of mechanism, paper runs the risk of being a little descriptive.</p><p>DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</p><p>PLOS Medicine requires that the de-identified data underlying the specific results in a published article be made available, without restrictions on access, in a public repository or as Supporting Information at the time of article publication, provided it is legal and ethical to do so.

This review considers the statistical aspects of the paper.</p><p>Generally, these are very good. The data sources and statistical methods are well described, and the results are presented quite clearly. My comments are fairly minor.</p><p>Conceptually, I would see this more as a case-control study, than a cohort study, since the population is defined by the outcome, rather than the initial condition. This is a study of all live births, not a study of all pregnancies.</p><p>Equally, I would describe this as a retrospective study, not prospective, since the study is being conducted after the data have been collected. A prospective cohort study would have identified all pregnancies as they happened, and followed them up to outcome. Quite rightly, the authors note the potential bias from not knowing about miscarriages.</p><p>At times, the authors stray into using causal language, such as in the conclusion that "Psychiatric diagnoses in both parents impact gestational age", which should be avoided.</p><p>I note that the exposure includes psychiatric diagnoses during pregnancy. Would there be any value in looking only at long-standing diagnoses as a sensitivity analysis? Or just at episodes during the pregnancy?</p><p>The statistical analysis section begins by talking about looking at the shift in distribution of gestational age at delivery, which is good, but this is only done graphically. No regression is attempted that looks at GA as a continuous outcome. The authors do go beyond a binary logistic regression to look at GA in 4 categories, but they analyse this with a multinomial regression model. Would it make more sense to use an ordinal regression approach? Would this get closer to looking at the shift in distribution? Saying that, the current categorisation only separates out different degrees of preterm birth - three quarters of the population remain in a single group, so an ordinal regression is not looking at a shift across the whole distribution, only a shift into the left-hand tail.</p><p>The authors choose to report unadjusted associations as primary results, with adjusted associations as secondary, but they do not make much of these secondary results. I have not reviewed every result in detail, but my impression is that the maternal associations are relatively unaffected by these adjustments, whilst the paternal associations, even if they remain statistically significant, are often noticeably reduced after adjustment.</p><p>In the results, it states that "4,597 (6.25%) of those born preterm had fathers with psychiatric history". Is this the wrong way round? I.e. 6.25% of those who had fathers with psychiatric history were born preterm? The same thing applies to the rest of that sentence.</p><p>The modelling treats parental psychiatric history as a 4-level categorical variable (neither, mother only, father only, both) but would it make sense to look at maternal and paternal psychiatric histories as independent predictors? Is there any evidence that the combination of both parents having a psychiatric history is any more (or less) than the sum of the two separate associations? The authors use "dose-response" to talk about the associations across the four categories used, but I do not think that is quite the correct term, since the exposure is not numeric. It makes more sense when talking of associations with the number of maternal and paternal diagnoses. It could work if describing the association with the number of parents (0, 1, or 2) with a diagnosis.</p><p>The discussion section starts by saying that there was a shift towards earlier gestational age associated with parental history of psychiatric diagnoses. I am not sure this is a fair interpretation. The regression analyses only look at degrees of preterm birth, not the whole distribution, so all you can say is that parental history of psychiatric diagnoses is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. This could be due to a shift in the distribution, but if parental psychiatric history was associated with an increase in the variance of gestational age at birth, but not the mean, then the same pattern could result. Regression analyses of gestation age at birth as a continuous variable would let you say there was a shift, but that might add a lot of material to the paper. </p><p>Table 1 reports income to 6 significant figures. Is this too much? Also, what are the units?</p><p>In the contents for the supplement, the title of eTable 2 is wrong. In eTable 2 itself, why only report the lower percentiles? Why not show 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th as well? Would that give a more complete description of the distribution, and the shift associated with parental psychiatric history?</p><p>Reviewer #2: This study investigates an understudied but important area, the contribution of paternal factors to pregnancy outcomes and offspring health. It has the advantage of large numbers by using the National Patient Register in Sweden. Psychiatric health is a timely topic given the reported increase in disorders during the pandemic.</p><p>In the introduction the paper highlights a data gap as "the association between maternal psychiatric history and preterm delivery has not been extensively studied across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Rather, previous studies have generally focused on mood and anxiety disorders." This statement is not entirely accurate, as reference 4 by M&#228;nnist&#246; et al found an increased birth associated with maternal bipolar disease and schizophrenia. The present analysis does expand on additional disorders, although I would defer to a psychiatrist about the categories. I think the main novel contribution of the current paper is the ability to study paternal psychiatric disorders. </p><p>The same comment about the 2nd data gap in the introduction. The current paper uses the same plots as the M&#228;nnist&#246; paper (ref 4), so it's not truly a data gap. I think the introduction would benefit from highlighting the 3rd data gap which is the most novel.</p><p>Methods</p><p>The definition of spontaneous and non-spontaneous preterm birth needs to be added to the "Psychiatric diagnoses and preterm birth" section on p. 6. </p><p>It's not clear to me why cubic splines were used for birth year with 5 degrees of freedom. Perhaps it would help to add a reference. I defer to a statistician.</p><p>Results</p><p>All of the covariates included in the models should be provided in Table 1 - for example, BMI, smoking, etc. Also, preterm birth is an outcome and outcomes are usually presented in a separate table, not Table 1.</p><p>This point is minor but only 1 decimal place is needed for percents, particularly the % preterm birth (p. 9. Lines 5-7). </p><p>Suggest using an alternative terminology for the reference group instead of "Undiagnosed parents". Perhaps "Neither parent with psychiatric disorder" or something along those lines. Also, is it "psychiatric history" or current "psychiatric disorder"? "History" means something different. Need to be technically precise with the terminology.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This study examines associations between parental psychiatric diagnoses and length of gestation. The study makes a valuable contribution to the field, and the results eloquently illustrate dose-response relationships between psychiatric diagnoses of the parents individually and in combination in relation to shortened gestation. Most of my comments are focused on language for presenting the methods and findings.</p><p>In the main descriptive results in the abstract and manuscript, the denominators for the percentages are not clear. In addition, it is not immediately clear where the numerator 15,540 in the abstract comes from. Accordingly, please explicitly specify that 15,540 infants were born preterm from parents one or both of whom had a psychiatric history. In addition, please ensure that it is clear that the percentages in the sentences beginning at line 14 in the abstract (page 3) and line 5 of the results (page 9) refer to the PTB rates within exposure strata, not the size of the exposure strata as a proportion of the overall analytic sample. I recommend reporting the total number of preterm infants and the overall PTB rate (at least in the main manuscript) for context. Finally, to improve clarity I would change "No parents" to "Neither parent" in the column heading in Table 1.</p><p>Given the heterogeneity in the literature around different GA windows and designations of PTB severity, I would explicitly define early term birth in the abstract (as you do at line 14 of page 5).</p><p>Please standardize the formatting of reference numbers to ensure consistency (some but not all are currently in superscript).</p><p>Lines 5-6: "Paternal support during pregnancy has been associated..."</p><p>Page 7, line 11: gestational age densities - this terminology is unclear to me, and I'm not sure whether it's a standard term. Perhaps "gestational age distributions"?</p><p>Page 5, lines 9-10: relied on modest sample sizes with mixed results - I recommend adjusting this to "relied on modest sample sizes and yielded mixed results"</p><p>In the methods (abstract and main manuscript), please clarify the definition of "Nordic parents", as it's unclear whether this refers to ethnicity, residence, citizenship, or another definition. If this inclusion criterion is based on ethnicity, that would need to be justified.</p><p>Please describe the follow-up time during which exposures (psychiatric diagnoses) were measured, and whether this varied within the study population. Given that outpatient diagnoses were available beginning in approximately 2001, births at the end of the study period would presumably have more complete information on outpatient psychiatric diagnoses than those at the beginning of the study period. It would likely also be informative to report how long before delivery the most recent diagnosis tended to be in mothers and fathers who had a prenatal psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., knowing how often you had to look back further than 2 years to find a diagnosis would give a measure of how many diagnoses would be missed in patients with &lt;2 years of prenatal data).</p><p>Last 2 sentences of page 6: I recommend rephrasing this to "We categorized gestational age into preterm (&lt;37 weeks) 23 and term (&#8805;37 weeks) birth, and then further into very preterm (&lt;32 weeks), moderate to late preterm (32-36 weeks), early term (37-38 weeks) and full term (&#8805;39 weeks).</p><p>Page 7, line 5 - change "was obtained" to "were obtained"</p><p>Page 7, line 8 - change to "...&#8805; 3 years postgraduate education, PhD education) were defined at delivery."</p><p>Page 8, line 11 - add "therefore" before "we did not include them..."</p><p>The authors report on statistical significance in several places where the point estimates are more important:</p><p>Page 9, line 18 - instead of reporting that associations remained statistically significant in adjusted analyses, please describe the changes in point estimates.</p><p>Similarly, page 10, lines 13-14: The estimated preterm risks remained when restricting to singleton births (eTable 9). Please describe any changes in the point estimates in the restricted model compared to the principal analysis.</p><p>Top of page 11: After adjustment ..., the risk remained statistically significant.

We suggest for additional clarity detailing the number of preterm births in those unaffected by psychiatric illness before detailing those that are affected, for example (or similar):</p><p>&#8216;Among the 1,488,920 infants born throughout the study period, 1,268,507 were born to parents without a psychiatric diagnosis and 73,094 (5.8%) were born preterm. 4,597 of 73,500 (6.3%) infants born to fathers with a psychiatric diagnosis were preterm. 8,917 of 122,611 (7.3%) infants were born preterm to mothers with a psychiatric diagnosis and 2,026 of 24,302 (8.3%) infants born to both parents with a psychiatric diagnosis were born preterm.&#8217;</p><p>Please also amend the same piece of data reporting in the results section of your manuscript (line 188 onwards).</p><p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p><p>Thank you for including an author summary. Please include bullet points preceding each individual statement.</p><p>Line 44 &#8211; please make sentencing beginning &#8216;Earlier studies&#8230;&#8217; a separate bullet point</p><p>Line 49 &#8211; suggest diagnosed &#8216;with&#8217; instead of &#8216;of&#8217;</p><p>Line 50 suggest &#8216;(average relative risk [RR] =1.12)&#8217; and thereafter &#8216;average RR&#8230;&#8217; please note however, comments from reviewer #2 (please see below) regarding the presentation of average RR Vs the range of risk, which we agree with.</p><p>Line 52 &#8211; sentence beginning &#8216;For both&#8230;&#8217; suggest making this a separate bullet point.</p><p>Line 57 &#8211; &#8216;Psychiatric diagnoses in both parents are associated with gestational age</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Line 64 &#8211; &#8216;&#8230;causes [1, 6, 7]&#8230;&#8217; please remove all spaces between citations for in-text reference callouts to read as follows &#8216;&#8230;causes [1,6,7]&#8230;&#8217;.

I feel the changes made are for the better, and their reasons for not making changes in response to some comments are fully justified. I have no further comments to make.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The authors have adequately responded to my comments. I have nothing further.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The has been improved substantially in line with the reviewers' comments. I have several minor substantive suggestions.</p><p>lines 50-52: It may be more informative to present the range of relative risks in each of the three exposure categories (fathers diagnosed, mothers diagnosed, both parents diagnosed) instead of or in addition to the average RR in each category.</p><p>75-77: evidence suggests that advancing birth, even by as little as 1 or 2 weeks before full term, can affect neonatal morbidity [26] and future health outcomes [2]. The phrase "advancing birth" suggests an intervention to change the length of gestation, which speaks to one of the main challenges regarding preterm birth and shortened gestation in general, i.e., PTB is associated with adverse outcomes later on, but it's not clear whether interventions to prolong gestation would also reduce these other sequelae (as both PTB and later adverse outcome may stem from the same underlying problem). Accordingly, I would rephrase this sentence to clearly avoid causal language, e.g.: "evidence suggests that even moderately shorter gestation is associated with neonatal morbidity ..."</p><p>Following are additional comments focused on language.</p><p>Line 175: before two years of conception - I recommend "prior to two years before conception"</p><p>Similarly, at line 238: "psychiatric diagnoses first diagnosed at least two years before conception"</p><p>176: to see how much - change to "To determine the extent to which the results were driven by individuals with provisional diagnoses"</p><p>89-90: I suggest "parents born in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark or Iceland"</p><p>193 and elsewhere - "25th to 75th percentiles" can be changed to "interquartile range" (or "IQR")</p><p>197: was shown in Figure C in S1 Appendix - change to "is shown..."</p><p>13-14: We extended the analysis beyond the PTB - I suggest "... beyond PTB"</p><p>25-26: Please report which disorders the 3 different estimates correspond to (as you do in the main text, lines 217-219).</p><p>49-50: when fathers were diagnosed of different psychiatric disorders - I suggest "... diagnosed with different psychiatric disorders"</p><p>59: could have impact on gestational age - I suggest "could have an impact ..."</p><p>66: One recent systematical review - change to "... systematic review"</p><p>73-74: a rigorous study addressing the combined effect of psychiatric disorders in the couples is notably absent - I suggest "a rigorous study addressing the combined effect of psychiatric disorders in couples ..."</p><p>91: The fathers were identified - I suggest "Fathers were identified"</p><p>94: Psychiatric diagnoses from specialist care were extracted in the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) - "... extracted from ..."</p><p>97: The data quality of the NPR has been verified [29] , and validated - remove comma before "and validated"</p><p>100-101: European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program - change to "European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"</p><p>135-136: Where a linear regression is analysing differences in the mean between exposures - I suggest "Whereas a linear regression analyses differences in the mean between exposures"</p><p>139: the quantile regression can estimate at which gestational age - remove "the"</p><p>145-146: Then we examined the risk by six psychiatric diagnostic categories and by subtypes under the categories.
