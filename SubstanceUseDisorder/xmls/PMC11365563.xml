SDOH were linked to patients at the &#8220;near-neighborhood&#8221; level. Multivariable models assessed association of patient characteristics with hospitalizations (incidence rate ratios [95% CI]) and costs (cost ratios [95% CI]).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of 1,958,532 patients with MDD, 49.6% had Commercial and 50.4% Medicaid insurance; mean ages were similar (43.9; 43.4) with more female patients (67.6%; 70.5%). MDD patients with Commercial insurance had a mean household income of $75,044; 53.2% were married; 76.5% owned their home; 64.4% completed high school or less; and 2.8% had limited English-language proficiency (LEP). Patients covered by Medicaid had a household income of $46,708; 68.1% lived alone with 41.6% married; 54.6% owned their home; more than 4-in-5 patients (80.8%) completed high school or less, and 6.3% had LEP. Nearly one-third of Medicaid insured patients with MDD had at least 1 hospitalization (29.6%) with a mean length of stay 6.8 days; total health care costs were $21,467 annually. Commercially insured patients with MDD had 14.7% hospitalization rates with a length of stay of 5.9 days; total costs were $14,531. Multivariable models show female patients are less likely (Commercial 0.87; Medicaid 0.80; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and patients with more comorbidities are more likely to be hospitalized (Commercial 1.33; Medicaid 1.27; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). All treatment classes relative to antidepressants only increased likelihood of hospitalizations&#8212;particularly antipsychotic+antianxiety use (Commercial 2.99; Medicaid 2.29)&#8212;and costs (Commercial 2.32; Medicaid 2.00) (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Household income was inversely associated with hospitalizations for both insured populations. LEP reduced the likelihood of hospitalizations by more than 70% among Medicaid patients (0.27, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and was associated with higher costs for Commercial (2.01) but lower costs for Medicaid (0.37) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Living in areas with no shortage of mental health practitioners was associated with higher hospitalizations and costs.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>We identified patient characteristics associated with higher rates of hospitalizations and costs in patients with MDD in 2 insured populations. Female sex, higher comorbidities, and living in areas with no shortage of mental health practitioners were associated with higher hospitalizations and costs, whereas income was inversely associated with hospitalizations. The findings suggest disparities in access to care related to income, LEP, and availability of mental health practitioners that should be addressed to assure equitable care for patients with MDD.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>Plain language summary</title><p>More patients with mental illness covered by Medicaid have social conditions placing them at risk for worse health outcomes than patients with Commercial insurance. Patients with major depressive disorder have lower incomes, and many live alone and in poverty. Many do not speak English well or at all and have a high school education or less. These factors impact access to care and lead to more hospitalizations with longer stays and higher costs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Implications for managed care pharmacy</title><p>This real-world study of nearly 2 million patients with major depressive disorder found Medicaid insured patients have higher burden of chronic conditions and social risk factors than commercially insured patients. Age, antipsychotics treatment, income, English-language proficiency, education, and living in an area with no shortage of mental health practitioners were associated with higher hospitalization rates and higher health care costs. These findings highlight the need to reduce health care inequities in patients with mental illness.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &amp; Commercialization, Inc.
