<boxed-text id="dtbox1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0015">We searched PubMed for studies published up to October 2, 2023, for scientific papers that examined cannabis use as a risk factor for the development of anxiety. The search terms used were &#8220;anxiety&#8221;, &#8220;anxiety disorders&#8221;, &#8220;marijuana&#8221;, &#8220;cannabis&#8221;, with no limits applied to language or publication date. Our search identified three meta-analyses and one systematic review which examined the relationship between cannabis use and anxiety. Most studies investigated the cross&#8211;sectional association between cannabis use and anxiety and reported an increased prevalence of cannabis use in individuals with anxiety and anxiety disorders. In a subset of studies examining only studies with a longitudinal design, there was mixed evidence about whether cannabis use was significantly associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, for both the general population and adolescents.</p><p id="p0020">Much of the evidence on the association between cannabis use and anxiety comes from small studies using random samples of the general population or youth and young adults. Across all studies in the systematic reviews, there were just over 100,000 individuals. Included studies had large variations in measures of cannabis use ranging from lifetime use to meeting criteria for a cannabis use disorder. Similarly, definitions of anxiety varied considerably, and anxiety symptoms and severity were determined by self-report rather than diagnosis by a health care provider. We found no studies using health administrative data at the population-level to examine the longitudinal association between healthcare visits for cannabis use and the future development of an anxiety disorder.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0025">Using linked health administrative data capturing all healthcare use for over 12 million individuals residing in the province of Ontario, Canada, we completed the largest assessment of the longitudinal relationship between cannabis use and anxiety in the literature. We used physician-based identification of emergency department (ED) care for cannabis use and outpatient, ED, and hospital-based care for anxiety disorders. We found that individuals with an ED visit for cannabis use were at over 3-fold increased risk of having an incident ED visit, hospitalization or outpatient visit for an anxiety disorder within 3-years of their visit relative to the general population. In a sensitivity analysis excluding all individuals with prior healthcare for any mental health or substance use disorders, an ED visit for cannabis use was associated with over a 9-fold increased risk of having an incident healthcare visit for an anxiety disorder relative to the general population. These elevations in risk were consistent across the lifecycle but greatest for younger men.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0030">Our study extends the existing literature on the association between cannabis use and anxiety disorders, which to date has used self-report for both exposures and outcomes and relied on small samples and survey-based designs. Our results suggest that individuals with cannabis use requiring ED treatment may be at increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder or experiencing worsening anxiety symptoms. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and policymaking, considering the growing prevalence of cannabis use and the ongoing trend toward liberalization of cannabis policy.</p></sec></boxed-text>

The current literature has a number of important limitations, including; non-population-based studies, the use of a wide variety of measures for cannabis use which may have less clinical relevance (e.g., self-reported lifetime cannabis use), and defining anxiety symptoms and severity by self-report rather than diagnosis by a health care provider. In addition, while several prior studies have examined differences by age groups (e.g., adolescents vs adults) few studies have examined differences by sex or considered age&#8211;sex interactions. Collectively, despite the high prevalence of cannabis use in people with anxiety, there continue to be large gaps in the understanding of the underlying mechanism and direction of this relationship (e.g., does cannabis cause anxiety disorders, do individuals with anxiety disorders self-medicate with cannabis, are there common risk factors for both).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p id="p0045">This study aimed to examine whether individuals with an emergency department (ED) visit for cannabis use were at increased risk of having healthcare visits for anxiety disorders.

For example, amongst individuals aged 10&#8211;18 years, the increased risk of incident outpatient visit, ED visit, or hospitalization for an anxiety disorder (secondary outcome definition) in individuals with an ED visit to cannabis relative to the general population was almost double in men (aHR 5.67 95% CI 5.19&#8211;6.21) compared to women (aHR 3.22 95% CI 2.95&#8211;3.52), see online <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref> for age and sex-specific hazard ratios.<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>Visual representation of crude percent of individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in the ED or hospital within 3-years of an ED visit due to cannabis and the general population by age and sex.

After adjustment, rates were over 3-fold higher than the risk in the unexposed general population of 1.2% (ED visit or hospitalizations) and 5.6% (outpatient visit, ED visit, or hospitalization). Males and females of all ages with an ED visit due to cannabis were at increased risk of incident healthcare visits for an anxiety disorder relative to the general population. However, adolescent<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> males experienced the largest relative increase in risk from cannabis use.</p><p id="p0135">Our findings add to the literature about the relationship between cannabis use and anxiety disorders and suggest both an association between cannabis use and the risk of anxiety disorders as well as with the severity of anxiety symptoms leading to the need for ED visits or hospitalization. The increased risk of our primary outcome (incident ED visit or hospitalization for an anxiety disorder) captures severe initial presentations or worsening of pre-existing anxiety disorders. The increased risk of our secondary outcome (incident outpatient visit, ED visit or hospitalization for an anxiety disorder) in individuals with ED visit for cannabis likely captures new diagnoses of an anxiety disorder. Previous studies have presented mixed findings with a 2021 meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies containing 49,273 individuals reported that cannabis use was associated with a slightly increased risk of developing any anxiety condition (OR&#160;=&#160;1.25 95% CI 1.01&#8211;1.54).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Critically, studies to date have generally had small sample sizes, incomplete adjustment for confounders, and generally relied on self-reported cannabis use rather than health records for identification of exposure to cannabis. Our findings of over a 3-fold increase in the risk incident healthcare visit for an anxiety disorder following an ED visit due to cannabis use compared to much more modest increases in prior work may be related to both the nature of our study design and greater severity of exposure (e.g., cannabis use requiring care in the ED vs self-reported lifetime or past year cannabis use). Our study cannot isolate the causal relationship between cannabis use and the development of anxiety disorders. While our findings raise concern that heavy cannabis use may cause anxiety disorders, there are two alternative explanations for our findings.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> First, individuals with an anxiety disorder who have not yet presented for care may have been self-medicating with cannabis in an attempt to alleviate symptoms. Our sensitivity analysis, excluding all individuals with any mental health or substance use history, continued to find a positive association, reducing the likelihood of this first explanation. Second, common risk factors such as genetic predisposition or adverse life experiences may increase the risk of both severe cannabis use and anxiety disorders. While there is increasing evidence of alterations by cannabis on neurocognition, including processes linked to anxiety disorders, further research in this area is indicated.</p><p id="p0140">Cannabis use is increasing globally, and emerging data from Canada and the United States suggests that higher-risk cannabis use (e.g., regular use and use of higher potency products) and associated healthcare encounters may have accelerated following non-medical cannabis legalization and commercialization.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Our findings highlight that cannabis use that requires care in the ED is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Given accumulating evidence of the association of cannabis use with severe psychiatric disease, further public education and interventions are indicated. For countries proceeding with the legalization of medical and non-medical cannabis public-health-oriented regulation based on best practices from alcohol and tobacco along with emerging cannabis-specific evidence may be indicated to avoid potential increases in anxiety disorders.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In the interim ongoing monitoring of changes in anxiety disorders following legalization are needed.</p><p id="p0145">Our study has several limitations. First, while the use of health administrative data has several advantages (large cohorts with reduced risk of selection bias) it captures care for cannabis use rather than cannabis use itself. Consequently, while our study supports that cannabis use requiring ED care is associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders, the findings have reduced inference for the relationship between less frequent or heavy cannabis use and anxiety. In addition, individuals in Ontario with higher risk (e.g., frequent) or disordered cannabis use who have not received care in ED settings would be classified in the general population, which would bias our findings towards the null. Second, our primary outcome, an incident ED visit or hospitalization for an anxiety disorder, is specific for anxiety but captures both severe initial presentations of anxiety and potential worsening of pre-existing anxiety disorders previously managed in outpatient settings. While our secondary outcome, which included incident outpatient visits for anxiety disorders, is more likely to be capturing new anxiety disorders, outpatient codes have not been validated specifically for anxiety disorders in Ontario. Third, health administrative data lacks information on patterns of cannabis use (frequency of use, type and potency of products) which may be relevant for the relationship between cannabis use and anxiety disorders. Finally, while our study design, which excluded prior healthcare visits for anxiety disorders, reduces the possibility of reverse causality, some individuals with incident ED visits for cannabis use may have already had anxiety but not yet been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or received treatment.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Regardless of causality, the finding suggests that individuals with cannabis use requiring treatment in the ED or hospital setting are at a high risk of anxiety disorders and may benefit from further assessment and intervention.</p><p id="p0150">This cohort study found having an ED visit due to cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of requiring hospital-based care for anxiety and being diagnosed with an incident anxiety disorder. The elevated risk was present for all age groups and in men in women but was particularly pronounced for younger men. These findings have important implications given global increases in cannabis use and potency, along with increasing trends toward the legalization and commercialization of medical and non-medical cannabis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0155">Dr Myran and Mr Pugliese had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p><p id="p0160">Concept and design: All Authors.
