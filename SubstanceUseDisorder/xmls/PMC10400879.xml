Evidence of this is found in previous studies reporting rates of those undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed, and the variable adherence to evidence-based management strategies such as the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). A PubMed search was completed using the following keyword search: 1) COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (all fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-Analysis (all fields) OR 3) articles in the top 20 medical or respiratory journals (available on request) or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Additional evidence reported here is sourced from the US Center for Disease Control, reports published by the US National Institute of Health, the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS).</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">This descriptive, observational study, which is focused on the management of patients at higher risk of exacerbations, i.e., those who have had &#8805;2 moderate or &#8805;1 severe (requiring hospitalization) exacerbations in the previous 12 months, includes analysis of de-identified, structured Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from a large population of patients across US clinical organizations. Findings add significant value to both the academic community researching COPD and critically to the healthcare professionals treating patients. Results report observed trends in how patients that are at higher risk of exacerbations, both those who are diagnosed with COPD, and those undiagnosed but who are symptomatic, are identified, assessed, and managed in the US. These results are presented in relation to national and global guidelines for COPD management, and Quality Standards as outlined in The COllaboratioN on QUality improvement initiative for achieving Excellence in STandards of COPD care (CONQUEST). Collectively, results point towards the importance of promoting adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and recognition of a population of patients diagnosed and undiagnosed with COPD who are at a higher risk of exacerbations and adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">The implications of our findings and all available evidence include raising awareness among healthcare providers of the opportunities to improve the identification and care of their patients with COPD in accordance with expert guidelines. This includes increasing the use of spirometry as a diagnostic tool, increasing cardiac risk assessment, and assessment of risks associated with oral corticosteroids, proper review and consideration in pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and regular follow-up. Should these practices be widely adopted the result would be improved identification and management of patients with COPD, and for patients, improved quality of life. This study also highlights opportunities to improve recording in EMR and includes a call to action for EMR software companies to develop tools that allow providers to easily adopt and employ coding strategies, and a call for providers to use these strategies consistently. The implication being that providers will have access to more complete medical records which are critical for patient care, and support care transitions when patients move across provider settings.</p></sec></boxed-text>

Specifically, in this observational study, we describe how US management of patients with higher risk (i.e., patients who have frequent COPD exacerbations, or probable COPD exacerbation events) compares to CONQUEST QS by using the most recent pre-COVID information from 2019. As the CONQUEST QIP is being implemented in both the US and the UK, it was important to assess patterns of care in both countries given the differences in healthcare delivery.

Critically, trends in practice were assessed among a sub-set of patients who are at higher risk of exacerbations and have documented moderate or severe exacerbations, or likely exacerbations occurring in the previous 12 months. In other words, there is a patient population with symptomatic COPD with clear opportunities to intervene and improve well-being. Although findings rely on the accuracy and completeness of recorded events in patients&#8217; EMRs, the opportunities for improvement are evident. These include (1) use of spirometry to confirm diagnosis, (2) regular COPD review to ensure appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, (3) cardiac risk assessment as cardiovascular disease is a common cause of death, (4) OCS risk assessment to minimize adverse events associated with OCS use, and (5) provision of smoking cessation interventions where appropriate to reduce associated risks.

Queries included code lists capturing support in the form of medication, referral to support programs, and provider counseling. However, opportunities to receive smoking cessation support are available to patients through many avenues including receiving community counseling and, in a growing number of states, prescriptions for the United States Food and Drug Administration's approved tobacco cessation products from their local pharmacists.

The Practice Performance Registry is a comprehensive data source; data for this opportunity analysis is pulled from over 1000 clinical organizations across the US. Additionally, comprehensive code lists were developed for search queries that included the following code vocabularies: SNOMED, ICD-10, ICD-9, CPT4, RxNorm, and LOINC. The algorithm developed to identify COPD exacerbations and probable exacerbations was specific, offering assurance that the cohorts identified are indeed at higher risk of future exacerbations. Analyses were carried out on structured EMR data and did not include free-text or prescription claims data and consequently, it is possible to have missed exacerbations and potential exacerbations. The de-identified dataset did not include geographical information, or information on size, entry, or exit of participating organizations. Therefore, although we were informed the registry grew significantly in 2015, it was not possible to determine if new data sources were drawn from representative healthcare practices across the US. As a cross-sectional and descriptive study, no formal statistical tests were conducted to determine if there were changes within each cohort overtime.</p><p id="p0210">Positive smoking history was part of the inclusion criteria for the undiagnosed potential COPD cohort, therefore those patients who had experienced COPD like-symptoms due to non-smoking reasons such as environmental toxins may have been missed. As asthma was part of the exclusion criteria, patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome are not represented. Limitations relevant to all US databases also apply here; patients often receive care across multiple locations and providers, and consequently EMR records cannot be assumed to be a full accounting of a patient's care. Attempts to mitigate these limitations are reflected in our eligibility criteria which excludes patients with less than two years of valid EMR data and in our thorough quality assurance checks.</p><p id="p0215">This analysis includes data through 2019, to minimize the potential, yet temporary, impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on long-term trends related to the quality of COPD medical care.

Improvement in consistent and accurate coding in patient medical records, along with additional EMR software tools that allow for this, are critically needed, both for appropriate identification and management of patients with COPD and for population health studies in order to better understand broad national trends and inform public health agendas and initiatives. Further, evidence suggests that influential factors contributing to these gaps include missed and late diagnosis, inadequate disease assessment to determine a patients current and future risk, and delayed implementation of appropriate pharmacological interventions. Collectively, these trends point towards the importance of promoting adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and recognition of a population of diagnosed and undiagnosed patients with COPD who are at a higher risk of exacerbations and adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0225">The authors meet criteria for authorship as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
