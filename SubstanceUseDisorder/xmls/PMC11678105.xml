Purpose: To describe the pre-implementation strategies used to adapt and implement a nurse-led transitional care intervention (Thrive) to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged patients diagnosed with an SMI. Methods: Two pre-implementation strategies, Evidence Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) meetings and Formative Evaluation (FE) research, were used to adapt intervention components. FE data included semi-structured interviews analyzed using Rapid Qualitative Analysis. Findings: Adaptations were made to core components of Thrive and strategies to support implementation were identified. Conclusions: Participatory strategies help to adapt interventions that are person-centered and tailored to the organizational context.

Introduction</title><p>Over 14 million Medicaid-insured adults live with a mental illness, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia [<xref rid="B1-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Medicaid is the largest payer of mental healthcare services, providing coverage for 21% of adults living with a mental illness, and 26% of adults living with a serious mental illness (SMI) [<xref rid="B2-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When hospitalized with co-occurring mental and physical health conditions, Medicaid-insured individuals with SMI experience higher rates of readmissions and emergency department (ED) utilization compared with non-Medicaid insured individuals with SMI [<xref rid="B3-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These disparities may be related in part to socioeconomic inequities, such as unstable housing, concerns over copays, or barriers in accessing medications [<xref rid="B5-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Deficits in transitional care support, including limited access to community resources may also contribute to higher rates of readmission and ED utilization [<xref rid="B5-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To address the post-discharge needs of people insured by Medicaid our team leveraged principles of human-centered design leading to the development of a clinical innovation called Thrive [<xref rid="B13-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thrive provides intensive wrap-around services including connections to medical and community-based social services to people insured through Medicaid who are transitioning from hospital to home. Now in its fifth year, Thrive has been recognized by the American Academy of Nursing as an Edge Runner for nurse-led innovations. The Thrive model involves an academic clinical partnership between Penn School of Nursing, Penn Medicine Homecare and Hospice services and three large urban hospitals.</p><p>A core feature of Thrive is our focus on addressing health-related social needs such as challenges with transportation and food insecurity as a central facet of transitional care support. Services provided through Thrive were designed with the understanding that many disparities experienced by people insured through Medicaid are driven by social and economic factors and the distribution of healthcare resources in such a way that disadvantages some groups over others [<xref rid="B14-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thrive optimizes the post discharge management process by intensifying resources and interdisciplinary collaborations across settings for patients at risk for experiencing health disparities. The published results of Thrive have demonstrated sizable improvements in post-discharge utilization outcomes for Thrive enrollees including higher rates of primary care connections and fewer readmissions and ED visits compared with patients receiving usual care [<xref rid="B15-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A notable finding of our early work was the recognition that at least a third of Medicaid-insured participants receiving Thrive services, were also diagnosed with a co-occurring serious mental illness (SMI) [<xref rid="B16-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While Thrive services are designed to support non-psychiatric admissions, we frequently witnessed the effects of unstable mental health needs following hospitalization, including a lack of connection to therapy and medication services. Patients with SMI experience a higher burden of medical comorbidities, and frequently follow intricate drug schedules prescribed by multiple healthcare professionals to treat their mental and physical comorbidities. These factors are often complicated by communication difficulties, cognitive impairment, and a lack of social support rendering them more at risk for readmission and ED utilization. Ref. [<xref rid="B17-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] To better understand the experiences of Thrive participants with co-occurring SMI, we undertook a mixed methods pilot study to examine the extent to which Thrive services met the needs of Medicaid-insured patients with co-morbid SMI diagnoses. Findings from the quantitative arm of the pilot study found no significant differences in 30-day ED and readmission rates between Thrive participants with (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 62) or without SMI (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 190). Despite the literature supporting a much higher 30-day (15.9% vs. 11.7%) and 90-day (16.1% vs. 13.2%) readmission rates for those with SMI compared with those without SMI [<xref rid="B18-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interviews, however, revealed that while Thrive participants diagnosed with SMI (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5) expressed satisfaction with services, they reported that their mental health needs were never fully assessed. One participant revealed &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">it would have been helpful</italic>&#8221; if someone had asked about their mental health needs, but they did not [<xref rid="B16-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Like many transitional care programs, Thrive was not developed to meet the specific needs of people diagnosed with SMI. The current literature suggests that many transitional care programs designed for people with SMI focus primarily on support following psychiatric hospitalizations [<xref rid="B20-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Components of these programs frequently include transitions of care coach, medication management, and connections to psychiatric providers, though lack attention to health-related social needs such as transportation, food resources, and stable housing. This raises concerns that the transitional care needs of people diagnosed with SMI and hospitalized for non-psychiatric conditions are largely going unmet. For people insured with Medicaid, who experience the additional burdens of economic concerns, the period after hospitalization can be perilous.</p><p>Using evidence from our prior findings, we designed a study entitled. &#8220;SMI-Thrives: An equity-focused intervention to Improve care transitions for Medicaid insured individuals with co-occurring serious mental health&#8221; (hereafter, SMI-Thrives). Using a Hybrid Type I implementation and effectiveness design, and a stepped wedge approach, SMI-Thrives extends and adapts the current Thrive model to address the transitional care needs of patients who are Medicaid-insured, diagnosed with a co-morbid SMI, and hospitalized for a non-psychiatric illness. This article has two aims: First, to describe the pre-implementation evaluation to identify needed components for the adapted Thrive model. Second, we sought to systematically identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of SMI-Thrive and link them to specific strategies to influence initial adoption.</p><p>The SMI-Thrives study is a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial that compares intensive transitional care support to usual care [<xref rid="B21-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the current Thrive model, Medicaid-insured individuals are (1) identified while hospitalized by nurse case managers and referred to home care services using an electronic medical record (EMR) flag. Following discharge, Thrive participants go on to receive (2) home care services where nurses perform medication reconciliation, intensive teaching and chronic disease management. Next, Thrive participants (3) receive continued clinical oversight by our interdisciplinary team including the discharging hospital-based physician or Advanced Practice Provider (APP) who facilitate care continuity if there is an absence of available primary care support. Finally, the nurse led Thrive Care Management Team (4) facilitates weekly interdisciplinary case management meetings for a full month where connections are made to community, primary, and specialty services [<xref rid="B22-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The goal of this paper is to describe the pre-implementation processes used by our team to adapt the Thrive care model to meet the transitional care needs of people with co-occurring serious mental health diagnoses hospitalized for a non-psychiatric admission. For our purposes our adaptation followed a thoughtful and deliberate alteration of the design or delivery of Thrive with an aim of improving its fit or effectiveness in a given context [<xref rid="B23-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We began our pre-implementation process by engaging staff, mental health experts, and community advisors using a participatory process which included a series of &#8220;meet and greets&#8221; with institutional partners. Next, we launched an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) workgroup to prioritize additional components to the current Thrive care model. To evaluate the context required for the adaptation of the intervention, we used a Formative Evaluation (FE) approach through interviews of clinicians and leadership who would have direct engagement with referrals to Thrive. The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved this study.</p><p><xref rid="nursrep-14-00278-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> outlines the pre-implementation research process.

EBQI Recruitment and Procedures</title><p>The EBQI approach was used to ensure that the added Thrive adaptations were acceptable to stakeholders and consistent with the evidence [<xref rid="B25-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For our purposes, the EBQI workgroup members offered perspectives on the challenges faced by patients diagnosed with SMI following hospitalization, and offered suggestions on essential components to consider as adaptations to the Thrive model. Given our goal, we sought workgroup participants such as clinicians with expertise in the care of people diagnosed with SMI, managers from the study site, community representatives, and caregivers of patients with SMI [<xref rid="B26-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To ensure we were including perspectives of people with SMI and to protect their privacy, we consulted with two external people diagnosed with SMI who provided feedback throughout the Workgroup process but who preferred not to be identified by their diagnoses. Workgroup members were recruited using both criterion and snowballing techniques which resulted in wide representation.</p><p>Our EBQI workgroup first received endorsement from the Hospital Executive team, which helped engender support during workgroup recruitment. The Hospital Executive team was composed of the Nurse Senior Executive and a Clinical Quality Improvement Officer who provided the team with the names of clinicians and managers who could add valuable contributions to the workgroup discussion. In addition, the study team sought the participation of clinicians and content experts (e.g., individuals with experience caring for people diagnosed with SMI) as well as individuals or caregivers of individuals with SMI. The study PI sent personal emails requesting participation in three one-hour work group meetings in early November 2023, with one follow up reminder sent a week after the first. A total of 20 invitations were emailed, with a total of 10 responses. An additional 3 members of the research team were included on the EBQI workgroup bringing the total members to 13. Non-research affiliated workgroup members were provided with a USD 100 honorarium for each one-hour meeting attended.</p><p>We hosted three one-hour EBQI workgroup meetings. During meetings, workgroup members offered perspectives on the challenges faced by patients diagnosed with SMI following hospitalization, described current mental health screening practices for non-psychiatric admissions, and prioritized essential components that should be considered as adaptations to the Thrive model. One critical aspect of our work was a review of practices currently operating within the hospital to assess and address the needs of patients diagnosed with co-occurring SMI. Examining existing clinical practices and support systems within the hospital and home care setting helped to set the stage for potential adaptations to the Thrive care model. We aimed to identify gaps and areas for improvement. During each meeting the facilitator stressed the importance of engaging a wide range of perspectives while emphasizing flexible aspects that should be considered. During our final meeting, the workgroup discussed the strengths and merits of 13 possible adaptations to Thrive. Using a consensus approach, participants were asked to rank order their preferences of proposed adaptations. The research team facilitated the consensus process, summarized the results, and then adopted those components that achieved majority support of the 10 non-research workgroup participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nursrep-14-00278"><title>2.3. Formative Evaluation Research</title><p>Formative evaluation (FE) is defined as a &#8220;rigorous assessment process designed to identify potential and actual influences on the progress and effectiveness of implementation efforts&#8221; [<xref rid="B26-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For our purposes, FE was used to assess whether Thrive was believed to address the significant needs for patients diagnosed with SMI. In addition, we sought to understand the community and organizational contexts, elicit potential barriers and facilitators, and prioritize implementation strategies to ensure a smooth launch of Thrive at a new site. Our FE processes were informed by the Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF), an adaptation of the Integrated Promoting Action on Research in Implementation in Health Services [i-PHARIS] framework [<xref rid="B27-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The FE included semi-structured interviews of clinicians and administrators who would be directly involved in the referrals and clinical care management of patients enrolled to Thrive. The HEIF framework proposes determinants that are believed to predict successful and equitable implementation of an intervention. The three health equity domains of HEIF are cultural factors, clinical encounter factors, and societal contexts. Engaging in this participatory process allowed us to increase buy-in from stakeholders and overcome barriers prior to the launch of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-nursrep-14-00278"><title>2.4.

For our purposes, we were most interested in gaining the perspectives of individuals who would have direct interface in referring to Thrive, providing clinical oversight or managerial support. Hence, participants deemed eligible for semi-structured FE interviews included case managers, social workers, and healthcare providers affiliated with the study hospital or home care setting. Eligible participants included those who had been employed with the healthcare system for at least 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nursrep-14-00278"><title>2.5. Semi-Structured Qualitative Interviews</title><p>The formative evaluation (FE) qualitative data were derived from interviews conducted virtually via Teams. Interviews were collected between February and March 2024, after the piloting of the interview guide by two study team members and authors (MBC, HB). Interview questions, informed by the Health Equity Implementation Framework, asked participants to reflect on perceived appropriateness of Thrive, challenges faced by patients following hospitalization, anticipated barriers to intervention acceptance, and organizational and workflow challenges, if any (<xref rid="nursrep-14-00278-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interviewers obtained verbal consent to record the interviews and memos were taken throughout the duration of the encounter. Twelve eligible participants were contacted by email for interviews and a total of eight agreed to be interviewed, which is sufficient to elicit rich and in-depth perspectives from study participants [<xref rid="B16-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Procedures.</italic> All eligible participants were contacted by email. The recruitment email included a link where potential participants could access information about the study and a consent document and select dates for interviews. Once the interview time was selected, the participant received confirmation by email and a unique Teams link. Recruitment emails were sent in three waves at the beginning of the study and in two-week increments as a reminder. A reminder email was sent 24 h prior to each interview. Each interview lasted approximately 40 min and was followed by a brief 5 min survey that asked for demographics, and 36 questions related to preferred implementation strategies and feasibility of the Thrive intervention. Detailed memos were taken throughout the interviews by the research program manager (KA). Twelve of these items included Proctor&#8217;s implementation outcomes that assess the acceptability (how fair or reasonable Thrive is deemed), appropriateness (to what extent Thrive seems suitable), and feasibility (the practicality and ease of delivering Thrive). Each construct is four-items assessed on a five-point Likert scale asking participants to rate how much they agree or disagree with each item. The items are averaged with higher scores indicating greater acceptability, appropriateness, or feasibility [<xref rid="B30-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The survey also asked participants to rank the usefulness of 12 implementation strategies drawn from the ERIC taxonomy. Participants were asked to select either &#8220;most useful&#8221; or &#8220;least useful&#8221; for each potential implementation strategy. Finally, readiness for change was assessed using the 12-item Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change instrument. Participants rated their level of agreement or disagreement with statements about their organization on a five-point Likert scale. The items are averaged with higher scores indicating more agreement that the organization is ready for change [<xref rid="B30-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Reflexivity Statement.</italic> Our interview team purposely included individuals with expertise in equity and implementation science.

Both interviewers have background clinical experience working across hospital and community settings and with patients with chronic illnesses including SMI. Half of the authorship team identify as persons of color and all have substantial research experience in the fields of equity, mental health, implementation science, and nursing.

Semi-Structured Interview Data Analysis</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Structured template and matrix display.</italic> A multistep process was used to summarize interview recordings using rapid qualitative analysis (RQA) procedures [<xref rid="B25-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The RQA process is a well-established process ideal for use during the pre-implementation process when a deductive approach is in use and when evaluating the feasibility or appropriateness of an intervention. Using Hamilton&#8217;s and Finley&#8217;s, 2019, method, we began by identifying interview responses corresponding to each interview question [<xref rid="B31-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our interview guide was developed based on the domains of HEIF. Interview questions explored participant&#8217;s views on the appropriateness of Thrive, aspects of the clinical encounter that might influence acceptance of Thrive, workflow facilitators and barriers, as well as community and organizational context.</p><p>Qualitative team members read the transcripts and noted particularly rich responses that were detailed and meaningful. We then developed a structured template to standardize the way to capture the interview content. The domains of HEIF were listed on the template for each study team member (HB and MBC) to summarize interview key ideas. To ensure inner rater reliability and applicability to the interview, two study team members used the template to separately code the same transcripts. The summaries of the two team members were used to confirm the relevancy of the template by comparing and modifying the template as needed. The two team members then divided the remaining interviews and summarized them using the template and HEIF domains. Responses that entailed representative quotes were timestamped for future exploration [<xref rid="B34-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The researchers mapped each template onto a visual matrix after summarizing each transcript. The visual matrix consists of a single column per interview transcript, with each HEIF domain represented by a row. Once the findings were entered onto the visual matrix, each row was interpreted, and key ideas were synthesized to assess convergence and divergence across participants.</p><p>Rigor was established by adhering to the four dimensions for qualitative research outlined by Guba and Lincoln [<xref rid="B35-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (1981) which include the following: credibility (e.g., training interviewer with relevant expertise), confirmability (e.g., leveraging methodological triangulation using a brief follow up survey), dependability (e.g., maintaining a detailed audit trail), and transferability (developing an operations definition to achieve saturation).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-nursrep-14-00278"><title>3.

The focus of the second meeting included proposed adaptations to the existing Thrive model. Examples of proposed adaptations included the following: addition of mental health screening during discharge process and integrated behavioral health assessments during Thrive case management meetings.

Of the seven potential adaptations, the three that received at least 2/3 endorsements by EBQI members included ensuring the comprehensive integration of a mental health assessment during the Thrive weekly interdisciplinary team meetings. This involved creating a standardized inclusive checklist pertaining to all mental health diagnoses, documenting the status (active vs. remission) of mental health diagnoses, and determining current behavioral treatments or levels of engagement with a mental health provider. Participants also endorsed the need to integrate mental health screening into discharge planning during afternoon team huddles. Finally, recognizing that some participants would be hesitant to receive Thrive or home care services, it was proposed that a member of the Thrive team conduct bedside visits to share further information about Thrive.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-nursrep-14-00278"><title>3.5.

Discussion</title><p>Our use of an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) workgroup and Formative Evaluation (FE) approaches allowed us to engage a wide range of stakeholders to inform the adaptation and implementation of Thrive in a new clinical setting. Through this process of participatory engagement, we successfully adapted the Thrive model to suit the needs of Medicaid-insured patients diagnosed with a co-occurring SMI and discharged from a non-psychiatric hospitalization.</p><p>Our final adaptation of the Thrive model was informed by the QUERI Roadmap for Implementation and Quality Improvement (2020) which outlines the following steps for adaptation, (1) assessing the fit to ensure that the adaptation of Thrive met the needs of our local setting, (2) assessing the importance of the adaptation to end users, (3) including stakeholders in what and how to adapt Thrive, and (4) making final adaptations prior to launching the trial [<xref rid="B21-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The workgroup discussion and interview results conveyed the shared sentiments of perceived value and the need for the services offered through Thrive. Our team sought input from end-users and those affected by SMI to support each step of the adaptation and implementation strategy selection process resulting in the revised Thrive care model.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-nursrep-14-00278"><title>4.1. THRIVE Final Adapted Model</title><p>The adapted Thrive model has several new key processes and core components. The first process includes the conduct of a screening for serious mental illness prior to hospital discharge (see <xref rid="nursrep-14-00278-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The mental health screen is completed by a Nurse Case Manager or Social Worker and incorporated into the readiness assessment that all patients receive as a part of discharge planning. Next, because mistrust was identified as a potential threat to acceptance as well as a lack of time by social workers and case managers to fully explain the benefits of Thrive, a second process adaptation was added to the Thrive model, namely &#8220;bed-side visits&#8217;, conducted by a Thrive team member. During bed-side visits, the Thrive virtual care coordinator or program manager visits eligible patients during hospital admission to provide an in-depth overview of the Thrive program and to answer any questions. This approach was believed to offer the benefits of more time for engagement and question answering and to relay experiences of prior Thrive participants. In addition to bedside visits, case managers and social workers reported other strategies to engage and increase trust among patients with SMI. They incorporate normalizing questions about mental health as routine, like other physical health-related questions. They also encouraged patients to exercise their agency in centering their personal goals in the discharge planning process. Finally, a key core component to the Thrive model includes the inclusion of a comprehensive behavioral health assessment during weekly virtual case conferences. This additional assessment by the Thrive care team includes a careful review of all mental health diagnoses and psychiatric medications, including the last date filled and the prescriber. A note with this information is sent to the social worker and the need for further mental health intervention is reviewed. The level of connection to a current mental health provider is assessed and, if needed, referrals for mental health support are provided.</p><p>Finally, consistent with recent calls for integrating implementation science and readiness for change into pre-trial planning [<xref rid="B36-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nursrep-14-00278" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], our FE and EBQI workgroup helped guide the use of implementation strategies to implement and support the successful launch of this study. Of note, selected implementation strategies included the following: identifying and preparing champions who were defined as dedicated clinicians embedded in the health system that could support, market, and drive the Thrive intervention. These individuals were viewed as stakeholders who could help overcome resistance in the organization. For our purposes, a Social Work Manager was selected as a Thrive champion who would bring Thrive up during daily team meetings and help to answer any questions raised by colleagues. A second implementation strategy included providing audit and feedback sessions to clinicians monthly. This feedback was viewed as a useful way to monitor, evaluate, and course correct as needed. Quarterly meetings with health system leadership were also endorsed as a way to ensure that the project remains aligned with strategic initiatives. The addition of interactive and educational meetings with staff involved in implementing Thrive&#8212;using train the trainer sessions&#8212;to facilitate Thrive peer training were offered to ensure training was accessible and credible. Finally, the inclusion of an EHR Thrive reminder flag was endorsed by all participants as a tool to embed a reminder into usual workflows.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-nursrep-14-00278"><title>4.2. Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to our use of EBQI and FE approaches. First, we were limited to individuals connected to a single hospital and homecare setting situated in a large northeast setting. Hence, the perspectives of necessary resources, challenges, and necessary Thrive adaptations and implementation strategies may vary by clinical setting and geographical region. However, future research should be multi-site to increase generalizability and could consider adapting the Thrive model for patients experiencing a psychiatric hospitalization. Finally, we conducted a relatively small number of FE interviews. Interviewing a larger number, though not necessary for qualitative research, could have nonetheless yielded deeper insights on implementation processes and perceived barriers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nursrep-14-00278"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our use of a rigorous pre-implementation process helped adapt the nurse-led Thrive transitional care model for people who are economically disadvantaged and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. These participatory approaches helped engage individuals with diverse viewpoints and resulted in intervention and implementation strategies, that are person-centered and tailored to the organizational context.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
