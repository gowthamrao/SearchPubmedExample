Severe clinical effects can occur if these products are ingested (Forrester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>; Jolliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>; Makrygianni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>; Reddy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Schwebel and Swart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>; Sheikh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Slima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>; Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). The most devastating effects occur when the ingested hydrocarbon is aspirated into the lungs. The resulting pneumonitis can have fatal consequences (Ghezzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Perrot and Palmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>). In 2021, hydrocarbons were among the top 10 most common substance categories associated with death among children&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years old reported to United States Poison Centers (PCs) (Gummin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021</xref>). Due to their low viscosity and many colors and fragrances, these liquids can be mistaken for juices and other drinks (Sheridan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>). This risk is heightened among young children, who have newly acquired mobility, are curious, and do not recognize danger (Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). Unintentional exposures to hydrocarbons associated with exploratory behaviors peak at ages 1&#8211;2&#160;years (Jolliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). Although emergency department visits and calls to PCs associated with hydrocarbon ingestion among children&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years old decreased from 2000 to 2009 in the US, one study reported a tenfold increase in emergency department visits associated with lamp oil ingestion in this age group from 2014 to 2017 (Forrester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>). Therefore, previously published research suggests that the decrease in hydrocarbon ingestion during the past two decades may not have been uniform among all substances in this category and that these exposures remain an important source of poisoning, especially among young children.</p><p id="Par15">The most recent national study of US pediatric hydrocarbon ingestions evaluated data only through 2009 (Jolliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). More recent studies have focused more narrowly on specific hydrocarbons such as lamp oil (Forrester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>) or kerosene (Reddy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Slima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>; Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>), exposures associated with a natural disaster (Cox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>); case reports (Ghezzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Murthy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>); or exposures managed by a single PC/hospital (Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>) or in other countries, such as India (Reddy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Jayashree and Singhi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>), Israel (Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>), or Egypt (Slima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>). The objective of this study is to update and expand our understanding of the characteristics and trends of hydrocarbon ingestions in the US among individuals&#8201;&lt;&#8201;20&#160;years old by analyzing national data for the years 2000 through 2021.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data source</title><p id="Par16">Data were obtained from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), which is maintained by America&#8217;s Poison Centers (formerly known as the American Association of Poison Control Centers).

Hydrocarbons in the following NPDS generic substance categories were included: diesel fuels, gasolines, kerosenes, lamp oils, lighter fluids and/or naphtha, lubricating oils, mineral seal oil, mineral spirits, other types of halogenated hydrocarbons, other types of hydrocarbons, turpentine, and unknown types of hydrocarbon. Among the cases provided by the NPDS, 297,640 met study inclusion criteria. Cases (referred to as ingestion cases in this article) were included if at least one route of exposure was (1) ingestion or (2) aspiration (with ingestion), which resulted in the exclusion of 120,492 cases associated with other routes of exposure. The following cases were also excluded from the study: (1) exposure occurred outside the 50 US states or District of Columbia (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1451), or (2) medical outcome was coded as &#8220;confirmed non-exposure&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;355) or &#8220;unrelated effect&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5044), reason for exposure coded as &#8220;adverse reaction&#8212;food&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;207) or &#8220;adverse reaction&#8212;drug&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;92) or &#8220;unintentional&#8212;bite/sting&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;11) or &#8220;unintentional&#8212;therapeutic error&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;484) or &#8220;unintentional&#8212;food poisoning&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;172). The NPDS defines &#8220;confirmed non-exposure&#8221; as an exposure in which &#8220;there is reliable and objective evidence that the exposure never occurred and that any symptoms exhibited by the patient were not related to the reported exposure,&#8221; and &#8220;unrelated effect&#8221; as a report for which &#8220;based upon all the information available, the exposure was probably not responsible for the effect(s)&#8221; (American Association of Poison Control Centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study variables</title><p id="Par18">Age groups were categorized as: (1)&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years, (2) 6&#8211;12&#160;years, and (3) 13&#8211;19&#160;years. The reason for exposure was grouped as (1) unintentional-general (includes exploratory behaviors), (2) unintentional-other (includes environmental/occupational/misuse), (3) unintentional-unknown, (4) intentional-suspected suicide, (5) intentional-misuse, (6) intentional-abuse, (7) intentional-unknown, (8) other, and (9) unknown. The NPDS defines intentional-misuse as &#8220;an exposure resulting from the intentional improper or incorrect use of a substance for reasons other than the pursuit of a psychotropic effect,&#8221; and intentional-abuse as &#8220;an exposure resulting from the intentional improper or incorrect use of a substance where the patient was likely attempting to gain a high, euphoric effect or some other psychotropic effect, including recreational use of a substance for any effect.&#8221; () Exposure sites were grouped into (1) residence (includes other or own residence), (2) school, (3) other (includes health care facility, public area, restaurant, workplace, and other), and (4) unknown.</p><p id="Par19">The level of health care received was based on NPDS-defined categories and was grouped into (1) no health care facility (HCF) treatment received, (2) treated/evaluated at a HCF and released, (3) admitted (includes admitted to critical care unit [CCU], non-CCU, and psychiatric care facility), (4) refused referral/did not arrive at a HCF, and (5) unknown (includes left against medical advice and lost to follow-up and unknown) (American Association of Poison Control Centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>). The &#8220;no HCF treatment received&#8221; category was calculated as the sum of the &#8220;managed on-site (not in a HCF)&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221; categories of the NPDS management site variable. If the management site was &#8220;unknown,&#8221; then that case was included in the &#8220;lost to follow-up/ left against medical advice/ unknown&#8221; category of the level of health care received variable.

For analyses, moderate effect, major effect, and death were combined into the category &#8220;serious medical outcome.&#8221;</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par21">NPDS data were analyzed using IBM Statistics SPSS 28 for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) statistical software. Population-based rates were calculated using US Census Bureau July 1 intercensal and postcensal population estimates from 2000 through 2021 (United States Census Bureau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">c</xref>). Analyses of the general characteristics of hydrocarbon ingestions were restricted to those cases in which the first-ranked substance was a hydrocarbon. A first-ranked substance is defined by the NPDS as the substance that is most likely responsible for the observed clinical effects based on the judgement of a Certified Specialist in Poison Information at the PC. Cases in which a hydrocarbon is first-ranked include both (1) single-substance (hydrocarbon only) exposures and (2) multiple-substance exposures in which a hydrocarbon is the first-ranked substance. To avoid misattribution associated with substance-substance interactions, only single-substance exposures were included in analyses of related clinical effects. All hydrocarbon ingestion cases (including single-substance, first-ranked multiple-substance, and non-first-ranked multiple-substance) were included in analyses of trends over time. Trends were analyzed using simple or piecewise linear regression models, as appropriate. Break points for piecewise regression models were based on scatter plots of annual rates. Statistical significance was determined at &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.05. Other analyses included calculation of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the magnitude of the relationship between risk factors and outcome measures, including sex and highest level of health care received, sex and medical outcome, age group and medical outcome, hydrocarbon category and medical outcome, hydrocarbon category and highest level of health care received, and hydrocarbon category and aspiration. A risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI was calculated for the relationship between sex and reason for exposure because of the high prevalence and tendency for an OR to over-estimate the magnitude of this relationship.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>General characteristics of the study population</title><p id="Par22">Among the 297,640 cases involving hydrocarbon ingestions among youth&#8201;&lt;&#8201;20&#160;years old from 2000 through 2021 reported to US PCs, aspiration was associated with 8166 (2.7%) of these.

Most first-ranked cases were single-substance exposures (98.3%, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;279,393) and occurred most frequently among males (64.6%), at a residence (96.5%), and were managed on-site rather than in a HCF (74.9%) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most common related clinical effects associated with single-substance exposures were coughing/choking (32.3%), followed by vomiting (17.9%) and nausea (5.7%). Dyspnea (2.4%), drowsiness/lethargy (2.1%), and pneumonitis (1.1%) were also reported (data not shown in table).<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table

This information is consistent with previous findings and is helpful for targeting prevention efforts (Jolliff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>; Tenenbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>; Sheridan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>). Strategies for primary prevention of hydrocarbon ingestion among young children include (1) use of opaque, child-resistant containers at the point of sale, (2) avoidance of use of colors, scents, and container appearance that could lead to confusion with juices or other beverages, (3) do not transfer the product to another container, (4) secure the closure of the container after each use, (5) storage in a preferably locked location that is up, away, and out of sight and reach of young children, especially if stored in the home, which is where young children spend much of their time, (6) consider storing hydrocarbons outside the home, (7) do not use high-risk products, such as oil lamps, in homes where young children live or visit, and (8) appropriate adult supervision.

This federal rule went into effect in October 2002 and likely contributed to the observed decrease in the rate of hydrocarbon ingestion among children&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years old by 67.2% from 2000 to 2021. However, the overall rate decrease was gradual during the study period with a slight acceleration in the decline from 2004 to 2006 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This contrasts with the more robust response to the enactment of the PPPA of 1970. The PPPA, which required child-resistant closures for selected toxic products, resulted in a decrease in ingestion of baby aspirin and other regulated non-baby aspirin products, including household chemicals, by 40% to 55% (Clarke and Walton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1979</xref>; Walton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1982</xref>). This decrease in response to the PPPA was rapid, occurring during the first 2&#8211;3&#160;years following changes in child-resistant closures (Clarke and Walton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1979</xref>). Our study&#8217;s data began in 2000, and therefore, we were unable to adequately determine the trend of the rate of hydrocarbon ingestion among young children prior to promulgation of the CPSC rule in 2001. Thus, although the CPSC rule likely contributed to the observed decline in hydrocarbon ingestions among young children, the magnitude of its influence is unclear. Another factor that may mitigate the effect of this regulation is that, although important, requiring child-resistant closures on hydrocarbon containers is only one step in the chain of protection needed to reduce hydrocarbon ingestions among children. The end product in which the hydrocarbon is used, such as an oil lamp, must also be child resistant and located out of a child&#8217;s reach.</p><p id="Par32">Consistent with previous publications demonstrating the severe clinical outcomes of hydrocarbon aspiration (Ghezzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Perrot and Palmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>), aspiration (with ingestion) in this study was approximately 16 times more likely to be associated with a serious medical outcome or admission to a CCU or non-CCU, and about 100 times more likely to be associated with death, than ingestion of a hydrocarbon without aspiration. In addition, lamp oils were three times more likely than other hydrocarbons to be associated with aspiration (with ingestion). Therefore, compared with other hydrocarbon categories, lamp oils were&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3 times more likely to be associated with a serious medical outcome,&#8201;&gt;&#8201;4 times more likely to be associated with admission to a CCU or non-CCU, and&#8201;&gt;&#8201;4 times more likely to be associated with death.</p><p id="Par33">In 2011, the CPSC was petitioned with a request to require opaque packaging for lamp oil and torch fuel based on the concern that the appearance of these products could lead young children to mistake them for juice (United States Consumer Product Safety Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>). Although torch fuel and lamp oil were already required to be sold in child-resistant packaging since 2002, this petition sought the additional requirement of opaque packaging, which is a strategy that has been employed for other products deemed attractive and dangerous to young children, such as cannabis edibles and liquid laundry detergent packets (Gaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>; Onders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>; Valdez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). In 2012, the CPSC voted to defer the petition to the development of a voluntary standard by ASTM International (United States Consumer Product Safety Commission&#160;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>). That standard, F3304-22, was implemented in September 2021 and updated in August 2022 and specifies the design and performance requirements related to packaging, closures, and product labeling for &#8220;pourable lamp fuel and torch fuel containers with a rated capacity of less than 5 gallons intended for household use&#8221; (ASTM International <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>). There was a gradual decrease in the rate of ingestion of lamp oils from 2009 to 2019 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but data from this study are not able to determine the influence of this voluntary standard on the ingestion of lamp oils among young children.</p><p id="Par34">Our study agrees with the overall decreasing trend found by Forrester (Forrester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>) for lamp oil injuries among children&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years old treated in US emergency departments between 2001 and 2019; however, that study reported an increase in cases from 2014 to 2017. Reasons that our findings do not reflect this increase include that (1) the study populations and surveillance methods are different (the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System is an active surveillance system involving a national probability sample of emergency departments and the NPDS is a passive surveillance system involving poison centers), and (2) the annual estimates reported in the Forrester study were small and potentially unstable, except in 2001.</p><p id="Par35">Teenagers 13&#8211;19&#160;years old accounted for 10.7% of cases. Although unintentional reasons for exposure also predominated in this age group similar to younger children, 17.8% were attributable to an intentional reason. Suspected suicide, misuse, and abuse were more common, which has also been previously described for other types of poisoning among teenagers (Becker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2022</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>). Impulsivity, risk-taking behavior, and other factors associated with immature executive functions and inexperience likely contribute to the higher proportion of intentional hydrocarbon ingestions in this age group (Ghezzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Rajesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). The public health strategies for prevention of hydrocarbon ingestions among teenagers should take these developmental differences into consideration.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par36">This study has several limitations. The NPDS is a passive surveillance system, and therefore, underestimates the incidence of hydrocarbon ingestion nationally. Data are self-reported and cannot be completely verified by the poison centers or America&#8217;s Poison Centers, which could lead to misclassification and potential bias. Cases reported to the NPDS do not necessarily represent a poisoning or overdose. Repeat exposures involving the same individual were not identifiable because we did not have access to personal identifiers. Despite these limitations, the NPDS provides a comprehensive national database useful for investigating the characteristics and trends of hydrocarbon ingestions among individuals&#8201;&lt;&#8201;20&#160;years old in the US.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Although the rate of hydrocarbon ingestions decreased during the study period and most reported cases resulted in non-serious outcomes that required little to no health care involvement, the number of cases remains high with a non-trivial minority (4.5%) of cases associated with a serious medical outcome, including 34 deaths during the study period. Thirty-two of these deaths were among children&#8201;&lt;&#8201;6&#160;years old and most were associated with aspiration (with ingestion). This underscores the need to increase primary prevention efforts, especially for young children.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CPSC</term><def><p id="Par5">United States Consumer Product Safety Commission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCU</term><def><p id="Par6">Critical Care Unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCF</term><def><p id="Par8">Health Care Facility</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPDS</term><def><p id="Par9">National Poison Data System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p id="Par10">Odds Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p id="Par11">Poison Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p id="Par12">Risk Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p id="Par13">United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SBP contributed to the conception and design of the study, conducted data analyses, and contributed to interpretation of data; she drafted the article, approved the final version to be published, and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of the work.
