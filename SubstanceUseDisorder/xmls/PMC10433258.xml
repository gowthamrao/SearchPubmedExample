It is a relatively uncommon disease, with fewer than 200,000 cases per year in the United States (US) [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. AC has been associated with high morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates widely ranging from 2-65% [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Smoking is known to have an impact on the inpatient outcomes of various medical conditions, including infections [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It affects innate as well as humoral immune systems, and has been shown to disrupt immunological homeostasis through various mechanisms, including its effects on nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as histone modification. This can result in either an exaggerated immunological response, leading to autoimmunity, or a weakened immune response that increases susceptibility to infections [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Smoking also has been identified as a risk factor for hepatobiliary diseases, including gallstone disease and possibly AC, yet it is unclear what effects smoking has on inpatient outcomes of AC [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Smoking remains a significant public health issue in the US, despite the fact that smoking rates have been declining in the US in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 12.5% of adults were current smokers in the US in 2020 [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effects of smoking on inpatient outcomes of AC, as smoking is a major cause of preventable deaths in the US. We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest inpatient database in the US, to compare AC-related inpatient outcomes between smokers and non-smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data source and study population</title><p>The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient database in the US.

We queried the NIS database from 2017-2020 using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) to identify adult patients (&#8805;18 years of age) hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of AC (<inline-supplementary-material xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:title="local_file" xlink:href="AnnGastroenterol-36-573_Suppl1.pdf" id="d95e159" content-type="local-data">Supplementary Table 1</inline-supplementary-material>).

It mediates its impact on immunity through several mechanisms, including the regulation of NF-&#954;B and MAPK pathways, as well as histone modification. This can result in either an unregulated and abnormally exacerbated immune response, potentially leading to autoimmunity, or a weakened immune response, which can cause infections [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that smoking is associated with longer hospital stays, greater morbidity and higher inpatient mortality compared to non-smokers [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, research has shown a connection between smoking status and autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Smoking may elevate the risk of developing gallbladder disease, through an unknown mechanism, and it also increases the risk of diabetes and reduces plasma high-density lipoproteins, both of which are potential risk factors for gallbladder disease development. A higher risk of gallbladder disease may heighten the risk of developing AC in smokers. Although smoking has been linked to gallbladder disease, and may increase the risk of AC, its effects on inpatient outcomes related to AC remain largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study on hospitalizations related to acute cholangitis in the United States between 2017 and 2020 to better understand the relationship between smoking status and inpatient outcomes for acute cholangitis.</p><p>Prior to matching, the non-smoker AC cohort had a significantly larger number of patients compared to the smoker AC cohort. The non-smoker AC patients were generally older (67&#177;0.08 vs. 56&#177;0.27 years), resulting in a higher proportion of patients with an Elixhauser Comorbidity Index of 3 or greater. The smoker AC cohort contained more males than females, which could be attributed to sex-related differences in smoking prevalence within the US [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the matched cohorts, the most prevalent risk factor for AC was bile duct calculi, bile duct stricture/stenosis, cholelithiasis, and other bile duct disorders (including clots, parasites, and exogenous compression). Consistently with previous studies, bile duct calculi were identified as the most common cause of AC, followed by biliary stricture and malignancy [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bile duct calculi and other bile duct disorders were more frequently observed in AC patients who were smokers compared to non-smokers.</p><p>The AC patients who were smokers had a higher proportion of in-hospital deaths; however, the difference was not statistically significant, though it nearly reached significance (1.01% vs. 0.63%, P=0.063). No statistically significant differences were observed in the LOS or morbidity between the two cohorts (P&gt;0.05). Nevertheless, smoking in AC patients was associated with a greater need for inpatient ERCP (72.85% vs. 63.76%, P&lt;0.001) and early ERCP (50.76% vs. 42.32%, P&lt;0.001), and higher odds of developing complications, including sepsis without shock (0.88% vs. 0.51%, P=0.042), sepsis with shock (1.26% vs. 0.51%, P&lt;0.001), biliary pancreatitis (6.57% vs. 4.42%, P &lt; 0.001) and myocardial infarction (6.19% vs. 3.54%, P&lt;0.001) compared to non-smokers. In the past, smoking has been identified as a predictor of the need for urgent endoscopic intervention [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The greater need for ERCP and early ERCP, as well as the higher odds of complications, probably indicate more severe disease in smokers.</p><p>This study, based on the NIS database, has several strengths and limitations. One significant strength is the large sample size, which enhances the generalizability of the findings to a broader patient population. Furthermore, the NIS database provides a wealth of information on patient demographics, diagnoses and procedures, enabling researchers to analyze a wide range of variables.</p><p>However, there are some limitations to consider. The retrospective nature of the study may have introduced selection bias and limited the ability to establish causal relationships. The NIS database relies on administrative codes for diagnoses and procedures, which can lead to potential inaccuracies and misclassification [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As the NIS is based on discharge records, there may be a lack of granularity in the data, such as detailed clinical information, laboratory results or longitudinal follow up [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lastly, unmeasured confounders may impact the validity of the study&#8217;s conclusions [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite these limitations, the study offers valuable insights into the subject matter, which can be further explored and validated through additional research.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that smoking did not result in greater mortality, LOS or MIC among patients hospitalized with acute cholangitis. However, it was associated with a higher risk of complications, such as sepsis, biliary pancreatitis and myocardial infarction, as well as the need for inpatient ERCP and early ERCP. These findings emphasize the importance of further research to better understand the relationship between smoking and inpatient outcomes of acute cholangitis.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary Box</title></caption><p>
