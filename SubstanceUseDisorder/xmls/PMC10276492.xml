These behaviors take place during a period of increasing identity exploration, instability (e.g., in relationships, work, residence), self-focus, and optimism [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The combination of autonomy-striving, social reorientation from family toward peers, and maturing cognitive functioning are often acknowledged contributors to elevated young adult risk behaviors [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>]. Aligned with this view, the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Study&#8212;the largest epidemiological panel study of adolescent and young adult substance use in the United States (U.S.)&#8212; documents long-standing peaks for most forms of substance use between the ages of 18-25, corresponding to young adulthood [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">One goal of such surveillance studies is to track historical and cohort perturbations in patterns of substance use, including those encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adults encompasses not only disease exposure but also changes to micro- and macro-societal contexts related to social policy and practices [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For young adults who may have been more vulnerable to pandemic stress, closures and restrictions in higher education, the workplace, and public gathering spaces exemplify indirect pandemic effects [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In several parts of the world, the pandemic coincided with heightened conflict around social justice and violence against marginalized populations, intensifying pandemic effects [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Echoing studies around the globe, MTF reported elevated rates of anxiety and depression symptoms for young adults during the first year of the pandemic [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">Less attention, however, has focused on pandemic-linked changes in young adult substance use. At the beginning of the pandemic, opposing theories posit that substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic would (a) decline due to restricted access to substances and the social contexts in which use occurs or (b) increase due to efforts to cope with rising distress, loneliness, and isolation [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Young adults, given their newly found mobility, peaking substance use, and intensifying social engagement, may have been vulnerable to both mechanisms [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">In the current paper, we summarize global studies regarding changes in substance use and the COVID-19 pandemic and related stressors. Of necessity, any one method can confound developmental change in substance use (which is rapid during young adulthood), ongoing historic change (cohort and non-pandemic secular trends) and acute pandemic-linked change. Thus, we reviewed both cohort studies (comparing different age-matched young adults over years) and longitudinal studies (comparing the same young adults as they age over the years). All studies allowed pre-to-intra pandemic comparisons or directly assessed associations between pandemic stressors and substance use. Our goal was to discern how the first two years of the pandemic impacted young adult substance use.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>1.2</label><title>Overall Trends</title><p id="p0055">Nationally representative studies provide the most generalizable estimates of overall changes in young adult substance use associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, although such data have only been published for a handful of high-income countries. In the U.S., MTF showed drops in some forms of substance use early in the pandemic, with only a subset rebounding [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. Of the most common substances, rates of binge drinking (5+ in a row) in the past two-week period dropped from 33% in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 24% in 2020 (March-November), with a rebound to pre-pandemic levels at 30% in 2021. This deflection point, however, was only evident in college students, as a 10-year negative trend among non-college young adults continued steadily into the pandemic. Ten-year declines in cigarette use that preceded the pandemic for both college and non-college young adults showed non-significant increases among college students (from 4% in 2020 to 6% in 2021) and a large coinciding decrease in non-college youth (from 13% to 7%). Use of marijuana and other drugs in the past 30 days did not notably change. Thus, although the overall U.S. trend is for decreases in some forms of commonly used substances (i.e., alcohol and tobacco) with some rebounding, differences for college and noncollege young adults were evident.</p><p id="p0060">Using a longitudinal design, Clare and colleagues similarly reported declines in alcohol-related harm in an Australian cohort assessed in the first months of the pandemic [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Trends in other national cohort studies, however, differed across drinking indicators. The Swiss Youth Epidemiological Study on Mental Health reported reductions in monthly binge drinking (6+ drinks for men and 4+ drinks for women) from 2018 to 2020 that were maintained in 2021; however, early declines in weekly binge drinking rebounded sooner, reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2021 [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, the United Kingdom (U.K.) Household Longitudinal Study reported increases in young adult binge drinking (6+ drinks weekly) and frequent drinking (4+ drinks weekly) into April 2020 whereas heavy drinking (5+ drinks on a typical day), cigarette use, and regular e-cigarette use all decreased relative to pre-COVID assessments. These findings were similar for young (18-24) and older adults (25-65+) and across gender and education level [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">Thus, a pattern for decreased alcohol and cigarette use emerged in nationally representative samples, except for more frequent, heavy drinking that increased or more quickly rebounded in the Swiss and U.K. studies. As such, individuals with greater pre-pandemic substance use may have been less likely to pause and more quick to return to substance use as compared to their peers [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, patterns differed in U.S. college students and noncollege youth. Given the salience of individual differences in these trends, it is not surprising that findings from other longitudinal studies with less representative samples (which vary in what individual differences they capture) diverged in reports of young adults&#8217; substance use over the pandemic.</p><p id="p0070">Such studies report increases, no change, and decreases in pandemic substance use. For example, heavy drinking increased in the first year of the pandemic across cohorts of 18- to 20-year-olds completing annual health care screenings in California [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Yet, in a study in Ontario, Canada of pre-pandemic substance users, daily drinking quantity did not change as heavy drinking and alcohol-related consequences decreased, regardless of income status [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Few studies reported data post-2020. Still, the U.S. multi-site NCANDA study did find decreased past-month drinking from pre-pandemic averages in June and December 2020, but increased drinking days among drinkers in June 2020. Still, both returned to pre-pandemic levels by June 2021 [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Typical drinking quantity and binge drinking did not change in the NCANDA study, even among pre-pandemic binge drinkers, though financial adversity increased nicotine use.</p><p id="p0075">Although still uncommon, recent longitudinal studies have begun to map factors accounting for individual differences in pandemic-related substance use in young adults. Findings showed that childhood maltreatment predicted self-reported increases in alcohol and cannabis use and greater COVID-related stressors predicted increased 30-day e-cigarette and marijuana use, but not changes in cigarette or alcohol use [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]&#8727;</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. Among pre-pandemic substance users, pandemic changes in anxiety and depression were unrelated to changes in drinking, though alcohol-related problems decreased less for those with clinically significant increases in depression [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">Together, these longitudinal studies suggest an overall drop in alcohol and tobacco use in the first year of the pandemic with a potential rebound (particularly for alcohol use) in the second year. However, this trend belies important individual differences potentially related to established pre-pandemic substance use and known risk factors such as adverse childhood experiences and depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>1.3</label><title>College Students</title><p id="p0085">College students form a unique group for change in substance use during the pandemic [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although several studies examined changes in residential college students&#8217; substance use, most used cross-sectional designs and retrospective recall or self-reported changes in rates of use [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>]. In contrast, Vasconcelos and colleagues assessed drinking during early lockdown (April-May 2020) and after lockdown restrictions were lifted (October 2020) in Portuguese students who reported regular binge drinking pre-lockdown [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Drinking fell faster among regular binge drinkers than infrequent ones, particularly among those who returned to family residences. The difference made the two groups indistinguishable after lockdown. Other studies from the U.S. show similar declines that were most pronounced in those under age 21 [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, Sokolovsky and colleagues found that U.S. college students who entered the pandemic using nicotine were more likely to pause past-week tobacco use if they moved back with family, had less pandemic news exposure, and had fewer pre-existing nicotine dependence symptoms [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p id="p0090">In contrast, a U.S. study oversampling 18-20 year olds who misused prescription drugs found increased alcohol and marijuana use within the first two months of the pandemic but reported no change in nicotine use or prescription drug misuse [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Increases in marijuana use were greatest for those with higher financial strain and marijuana craving, whereas nicotine use increased most among those with lower loneliness and higher financial strain. Together, these studies highlight the role of college campuses in providing access to substances and use-friendly contexts, particularly for those underage. They also highlight the role of other factors (news exposure, financial strain, loneliness, and prior substance use) that may similarly impact college and noncollege young adults.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>1.4</label><title>Socially Marginalized Young Adults in the United States</title><p id="p0095">Although discrimination and prejudice intensified for many marginalized young adults during the pandemic [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we found no longitudinal studies that assessed changes in substance use in these young adults relative to their peers. However, three studies noted changes within these young adults and provide a starting point for addressing potentially unique pandemic responses in these groups. For example, Hicks found non-linear changes in drinking such that rates of abstinence and high frequency drinking rose early in the pandemic and infrequent drinking fell [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These changes were similar across Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx college students. Moving back to family decreased use, whereas prior trouble with the police and impulsivity increased use. Romano and Sanchez found increases in early pandemic drinking in a noncollege sample of young adult Latinos immigrating to the US, especially for those under 21 [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Lastly, though not assessing pre-pandemic change, a daily diary study of sexual/gender minority young adults found that COVID news exposure was unrelated to daily alcohol and marijuana use but did predict higher coping motives for both substances. In addition, participants with greater news exposure drank less but had higher coping motives for drinking [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although more research is needed, initial studies point to complexity in understanding intersecting pandemic and marginalization experiences as impacting young adult substance use.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>1.5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0100">In general, longitudinal findings indicate that alcohol and tobacco use dropped following pandemic lockdown before rebounding for many young adults about one year later (similar to more inclusive reviews, [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). This trend is both tentative (based on few studies) and qualified, hiding substantial variation in early responses to the pandemic across individuals and settings. Few studies report findings from 2021 or later, underlining the need for further research even as public concern about the pandemic has waned. Assessing long-term impact requires attention to how the developmental timing of pandemic experiences affect rising cohorts of young adults both in terms of normative early increases and later decreases in substance use during this life stage [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Importantly, we do not yet know whether the overall trajectory of young adulthood substance use has shifted over time, particularly for less commonly used substances.</p><p id="p0105">Nonetheless, we offer the following early lessons from our summary. First, decreased access matters, particularly for underaged college youth. This finding reinforces efforts for greater uptake of empirically-supported programs that restrict availability of high-risk drinking contexts on campuses [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Second, individual differences are key to understanding the impact of the pandemic on young adult substance use. This is likely particularly true for understanding pandemic effects within socially marginalized communities for whom societal stressors were compounded [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Third, links between the surging mental health crisis and substance use have yet to play out. Pandemic-primed elevations in anxiety, depression, and suicidality continue for young adults; all of which show pre-pandemic associations with substance use [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Because studies of mental health often do not assess substance use, we have yet to learn whether anticipated surges in substance use to cope with distress&#8212;including isolation and loneliness&#8212;are part of the current mental health crisis for your adults. Fourth, pharmacological interventions have increased with the mental health crisis [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], many of which are contraindicated for alcohol and drug use. Thus, substance use may undermine such intervention or may carry greater physiological risks due to such co-use. Fifth and finally, more robust surveillance systems for young adult substance use are needed that include other health outcomes and separate developmental and historical change (e.g., accelerated longitudinal cohort designs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0110">The first author serves as the chair of the scientific advisory board for the NCANDA study, results from which are highlighted in this article.
