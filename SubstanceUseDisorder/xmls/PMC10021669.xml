Most cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2020, approximately 604,000 women received a cervical cancer diagnosis, and an estimated 342,000 women died from the disease [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Following the introduction of organized cervical cancer screening in the 1960s, high-income countries have experienced a steady decline in cervical cancer rates [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for cervical cancer in resource-rich countries is 10/100,000 compared to 25 to 55/100,000 in resource-limited countries [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the United States, cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased by more than 70% since the 1950s and the decline in cervical cancer death rates is largely credited to screening programs [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the burden of cervical cancer remains prevalent in many LMICs where screening programs are either unavailable or poorly implemented. According to the World Health Survey, the mean crude coverage of cervical cancer screening in LMICs was reported to be 45%, and effective coverage (a measure that combines intervention need, use, and quality) was reported at 19% [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To increase screening coverage in LMICs, it is essential to identify and implement feasible and cost-effective screening strategies appropriate for these settings. Existing methods include: unaided visual inspection (UVI), visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), or visual inspection with Lugol&#8217;s iodine (VILI). The most common practice in LMIC settings is VIA which is considered cost-effective and feasible&#8211;requiring less provider training and produces immediate results, reducing patient loss to follow-up and allowing for a screen-and-treat approach [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. That said, there are limited data comparing the performance of VIA with more commonly used screening methods such as the Pap smear with or without reflex HPV testing and primary HPV testing (either laboratory-based or point-of-care) alone [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. VIA or VILI alone or rapid resulting point-of-care HPV testing or a combination of these have the potential to transform cervical cancer screening to a screen-and-treat approach in resource limited settings. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature to compare the average performance of different screening tools to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above in LMIC settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials &amp; methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Study search and selection</title><p>The CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to identify studies assessing test performance of VIA, VILI, primary HPV testing, and Pap smear, published from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020. These databases were searched using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms such as &#8220;cervical cancer&#8221;, &#8220;visual inspection&#8221;, &#8220;pap smear&#8221;, &#8220;developing country&#8221;, &#8220;mass screening&#8221;, and &#8220;clinical outcome&#8221;. Publications were restricted to the English language. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020206154) and the report adheres to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A review protocol was not prepared.</p><p>The study population of interest included non-pregnant women aged 30&#8211;65 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who received VIA testing and either VILI, Pap smear, or primary HPV test between 1990&#8211;2020. The decision to exclude studies was because women under 30 have a low prevalence of underlying high-grade lesions and a high prevalence of transient HPV infection, meaning that they contract and eradicate HPV more quickly than women 30 years and older [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies that included participants who were pregnant or had a history of hysterectomy were excluded from this review. Studies with an inclusion criterion specifying that participants be symptomatic were also excluded from this review as those patients would require diagnostic testing and not screening. Additionally, studies that utilized co-testing, as opposed to primary HPV testing, were excluded. HPV co-testing includes both a Pap test and HPV test performed at the same time, while primary HPV tests involve a singular HPV test. Only primary HPV test results were collected in order to isolate the test results and determine screening performance of the singular test.</p><p>This review evaluated diagnostic accuracy at the CIN2+ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and higher), given the higher likelihood of CIN2+ progression to cervical cancer [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies included in this review consisted of randomized controlled clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded from this review due to differing inclusion criteria and to avoid duplication of studies included in this review. Good and fair quality studies were assessed for inclusion in this review, as defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Data that was available only in abstract form or grey literature were not eligible.</p><p>Covidence software was used for data management throughout this review [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Two reviewers independently screened all study titles and abstracts identified through MeSH database searches and selected studies for full-text review. Reviewers then individually screened all full texts to select studies for data extraction. Disagreements between independent reviewers were adjudicated by a third reviewer for title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data extraction</title><p>A standardized data extraction sheet was designed to extract data relevant to the review.

In addition, author KS extracted a subsample of 10% of studies to check for variation in extraction. The primary outcome included extraction of the sensitivity and specificity of VIA, VILI, primary HPV tests, and Pap tests; VILI was the CIN2+ threshold. When raw data was available, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, these results were extracted. When only computed data for sensitivity and specificity was available, individual raw data were calculated based on identified proportions. When studies reported CIN2 and CIN3 as separate thresholds, these measures were weighted and combined to determine sensitivity and specificity of the combined CIN2+ threshold. Measures that were reported as HSIL on the Bethesda scale were converted to the CIN reporting method and denoted as CIN2+ [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. When studies reported outcomes for aggregates by age group, outcomes were either extracted or backed into using raw true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) for the desired age group (&#8805; 30 years). Secondary outcomes included the extraction of positive predictive value, negative predictive value, adverse effects, and likelihood ratios. Information was also extracted regarding the study-level characteristics and participant-level characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data synthesis and analyses</title><p>This study utilizes the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) approach to quantitatively synthesize extracted data [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Through DTA, representative pooled statistics of sensitivity and specificity are combined into one effect size. Additional representative pooled statistics generated include the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and forest plot, as well as the pooled receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. The DOR is the odds of a positive diagnostic test among those who actually have cervical cancer relative to the odds of a positive diagnostic test among those who do not have cervical cancer. The SROC is a curve plot with the sensitivity as the y-axis and the false positive rate (i.e., one minus the values of the specificity) as the x-axis. These representative pooled statistics and pooled lines are derived from raw data including the true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative values that make up a 2 x 2 table [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>To perform the DTA approach, raw data (TP, FP, FN, TN) was coded in RStudio (version 1.2.5042) to generate pooled statistics of sensitivity, specificity and DOR, as well as a summary line (SROC curve) [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The R &#8220;mada&#8221; package reitsma model was used to calculate these pooled statistics using the bivariate model, estimating pooled measures of sensitivity and specificity separately for each comparison group while accounting for the potential correlation between sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The bivariate model is similar to the random effects meta-analysis model of a pair-wise comparison, and is able to estimate heterogeneity, or the within-study and between-study variation of studies. This model assumes a binomial distribution to model representative pooled statistics for within-study variation, and a bivariate normal distribution for between-study variation [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The bivariate approach produces unbiased estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and their correlation, and does not rely on ad hoc continuity correction for zero marginal counts [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A subgroup analysis was also performed, generating pooled estimates for each comparison group by reference standard. Summary receiver-operating characteristics curves (SROC) were obtained along with 95% confidence regions for the bivariate estimates of sensitivity and 1-specificity. This curve indicates how discriminating a model is, and how well one is able to discern an individual study from another study included in the review [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Following the generation of pooled statistics, heterogeneity was verified and reported. Heterogeneity could be due to chance, difference in cut-off value, difference in study design, prevalence, research environment, and demographic factors of the sample population [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To assess statistical heterogeneity, the Higgins&#8217; I<sup>2</sup> measure was quantified, indicating the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, the symmetry and scattering of the SROC curve was assessed, and the correlation coefficient of sensitivity and specificity was calculated using the R &#8220;mada&#8221; package [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The R &#8220;meta&#8221; package was used to calculate the total effect sizes of pooled statistics through univariate analysis, such as the combined sensitivity for all studies included in the VIA comparison group [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This data was then plotted via &#8220;mada&#8221; on an SROC curve utilizing bivariate analysis [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This was a necessary step given the limitations of the &#8220;mada&#8221; package in calculating total effect sizes and allowed for each pooled statistic value to be verified through univariate analysis in addition to bivariate analysis.

Disease status was confirmed with either colposcopy-directed biopsy, biopsy alone, colposcopy alone, or liquid-based cytology. Results indicated that VIA and primary HPV testing had similar sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios; pap smears offered higher specificity, but lower sensitivity. VILI had the worst diagnostic performance, appearing to be the most undesirable screening method of the four methods evaluated. These findings have major implications for screen-and-treat guidelines in LMICs that need to occur in parallel with HPV vaccination to address global cervical cancer incidence and mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Conventional Pap smear continues to be the most widely used cervical cancer screening method worldwide, despite constraints with the sensitivity of the test. This study demonstrated low sensitivity which aligns with other meta-analyses that have evaluated performance and test characteristics of Pap smear [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The low sensitivity associated with Pap smear appears to be attributable to the nature of the test, variation in how the procedure is done or the slide is made or the histology read, and necessitates the use of co-testing with HPV testing or rescreening for cervical cancer annually or bi-annually. Additionally, pap smears do not allow for a screen-and-treat approach, requiring patient follow-up after the initial appointment which proves to be a barrier for patients in LMIC settings where travel and transport may be an issue [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The highest performing diagnostic test in this meta-analysis was primary HPV testing. However, for laboratory-based primary HPV testing, cost-effectiveness, loss to follow-up, and inadequate testing conditions continue to be barriers in LMIC settings [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. If rapid resulting point-of-care HPV testing were more widely available and performed similarly, it is likely that this would be the test of choice. Point-of-care primary HPV test kits allow for both provider-collected samples as well as self-sampling in a health care setting or at home, increasing convenience and patient comfort. Furthermore, the ability to make a diagnosis during one visit provides the opportunity for a &#8216;screen and treat&#8217; protocol using methods like cryotherapy or thermocoagulation for treatment.</p><p>While all methods are relatively safe, the added discomfort during VIA and pap procedures may discourage women, particularly in settings where follow-up services are less accessible. It is also important to note the burden of misdiagnosis and over-screening. False-negative reports, or failing to identify CIN, contributes to increased rates of cervical cancer [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Alternatively, false-positive reports, or inaccurately characterizing cells as abnormal, are shown to cause both physical and psychological burden in patients, including anxiety and unnecessary invasive investigative procedures and treatment [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In both cases, inaccurate results contribute to patient harm and over-screening, leading to increased cost and patient mistrust in screening practices [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An idyllic cervical cancer screening test would be able to be performed in a primary healthcare facility, conducted with limited training and technology, and produce rapid (e.g., same-day, point-of-care) results. These outcomes stress the importance of a high-performing screening test to minimize harm in patient populations [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>With the exception of the VILI group, results indicated considerable heterogeneity for VIA, Pap, and primary HPV screening when analyzing SROC curves. This finding suggests that there is very little similarity between studies in each comparison group. Studies were all high quality as determined by the NIH Quality Assessment Tool, and comparisons were performed in similar patient populations with a mean &#8805; 35 years of age living in LMICs [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Heterogeneity may be a function of study designs, the dataset, the available data, or a combination of these issues. Further analysis should be done to confirm whether certain variables contribute to increased heterogeneity in outcomes, such as the study region, study size of the population, or capacity of test providers [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>One of the major strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis is the ability to examine test characteristics in the population of patients aged 30&#8211;65 years. Focusing on this patient population addresses CIN findings that are more likely to progress to cervical cancer and less likely to resolve without treatment [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The scope of this review allowed for any LMIC to be included, contributing to the breadth of the dataset and evaluating performance of these screening tests on a global stage. This review helped to identify gaps in the literature; the majority of studies evaluated screening methods in peri-urban and urban areas of middle-income countries. Future studies should explore test performance of screening methods in expanded geographies, to include rural populations, low-income countries, and high-income countries. Additionally, most studies did not report outcomes beyond sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Studies should expand reporting to include values such as likelihood ratios and DOR to aid in the assessment of clinical utility of the results.</p><p>This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. By evaluating performance of test characteristics solely at the CIN2+ threshold, performance of screening methods at ASCUS and CIN1 thresholds were missed. Evaluating performance at multiple thresholds would help to provide context for results at the CIN2+ threshold, as well as contribute to the body of evidence supporting the use of certain screening methods. Another limitation related to threshold was the standardization of the Bethesda system under the CIN reporting system umbrella. While this crosswalk allowed for standardized comparisons groups, studies using the Bethesda system to report CIN may have had slight variations in CIN diagnosis by clinicians and using various methods to establish the reference group could not be accounted for. The studies included in this review did not always stratify data by pregnancy status as outlined in the exclusion criteria, including data from the LAMS study in the narrative synthesis, which had a 3.5% pregnant population at the time of the screening [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The studies included in this meta-analysis and literature review also did not consistently report HPV serotypes. We also did not stratify by HIV status in our analyses because not all studies reported HIV status of women; however, a recent meta-analysis was conducted that examined similar outcomes to our study among only women living with HIV [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additionally, manual calculations and rounding of estimates in the literature may have contributed to slight discrepancies in extracted outcomes [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The majority of studies included in this study employed a cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to derive causal relationships and assumes a representative sample. Additionally, there are a limited number of trained cytologists and laboratory personnel to conduct quality assurance of these screening methods in LMICs, leading to variability in the quality of assessment across places and time. Finally, all systematic reviews are subject to publication bias; further, our review was limited to articles published in English. The review and meta-analysis would have benefited from the inclusion of additional languages, particularly given its global scope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on these findings, primary HPV testing and VIA testing demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for early detection of CIN2+ in women aged 30&#8211;65 years in LMIC settings. We note that the sensitivity and specificity of VIA were high in this meta-analysis; in practice, there is substantial variability in how procedures are conducted and interpreted by clinicians. In resource-constrained settings, however, VIA may be a useful screening method given the cost-effectiveness of the test when compared to laboratory-based primary HPV testing. Given the cost and infrastructure required for the laboratory-based primary HPV testing as well as the requirement for a follow up visit, the development of low-cost point of care primary HPV testing kits that screen for 14 high-risk types of HPV and produce results in 1 to 2.5 hours holds significant promise for use in LMICs [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Recent World Health Organization guidelines also corroborate our results and conclusions of their use in LMICs; primarily, that policy-makers and governments should be allocating funds and resources for clinician application of primary HPV testing among women [<xref rid="pgph.0001598.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our review also amplifies the need for reproducible research in this topic area, examining a range of CIN thresholds, and conducting more head-to-head comparisons to better understand the performance of screening methods in low- and middle-income countries. Lastly, this review does not address demand-side considerations regarding awareness of cervical cancer screening and what efforts might be needed to improve health-seeking by women in LMICs.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>NIH study quality assessments for observational studies (n = 11) and a randomized control trial (n = 1) (N = 12).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s001.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>PRISMA 2020 checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Studies with data on HPV screening.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s003.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Studies with data on Pap smear screening.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s004.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Data</label><caption><title>Studies with data on VIA screening.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s005.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001598.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S4 Data</label><caption><title>Studies with data on VILI screening.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pgph.0001598.s006.xlsx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our appreciation to the global community of researchers whose work contributed to this systematic review and meta-analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0001598.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Sung</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Ferlay</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Laversanne</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Soerjomataram</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries</article-title>. <source>CA Cancer J Clin</source>. <year>2021</year><month>May</month>;<volume>71</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>209</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>49</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3322/caac.21660</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33538338</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pgph.0001598.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Cervical cancer [Internet].

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript on the performance of screening tools for cervical neoplasia among women in low and middle income countries.</p><p>The manuscript is well written</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1. The test parameters for the screening tests would look very different in a high income country. The authors did not comment on this in the discussion. It is very important as decisions on a screening test should be made on results from the test in the environment in which it will be used.</p><p>Minor comment:</p><p>1. Lines 261-263 are a repeat of lines 259-261</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This study addresses an important research question and adds to the existing literature on the subject. I do have a few comments that in my opinion will strengthen this paper.</p><p>1. Whereas most readers understand the concepts of sensitivity and specificity, they may be less familiar with diagnostic odds ratio and the pooled receiver operating characteristic curve. It would be good define all of these measures (with equations if possible) early in the Methods section.</p><p>2. Some of the forest plots include just one or two studies. These results should be considered and reported, of course, but I would advise against calling it a &#8220;meta-analysis&#8221;. I suggest limiting the meta-analysis to situations where there are at least three studies.</p><p>3. Some of the results are so heterogeneous that a pooled estimate is essentially uninterpretable. In those circumstances it is more useful to explore the reasons for heterogeneity, rather than simply acknowledging its existence. This can be done qualitatively (by trying to understand the difference across studies) or quantitatively (e.g. through meta-regression analysis). Given the relative paucity of the data, a qualitative approach may be more feasible.</p><p>4. I must confess I don&#8217;t know how to read the pooled SROC curves, especially in Figures 2 and 5. They don&#8217;t look like ROC curves in a typical study. I wonder if simply reporting numeric AUC values would be better.</p><p>5. It is hard to believe that all studies were of equally high quality (as stated in the discussion). The study quality is really a relative rather than an absolute measure. Surely some studies are stronger than others. For example, only one of the 12 studies was a randomized trial. It would be good to know how its findings compare to those reported in cross sectional studies.</p><p>One minor point: Some acronyms and abbreviations (e.g. CIN2+, TP, TN, etc.) should be spelled out when they are first mentioned in the text. This is not always the case.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#160;The topic is relevant to the target context, LMIC.</p><p>The authors have provided adequate information in all sections that allow readers to; understand where there is a problem, what is intended to be done and how the study was executed. In other words, a scientist could easy reproduce the study</p><p>The details and justifications of approaches used increase the rigor of the authors' work. Furthermore, consistency in the write up is commendable.</p><p>Few things need the attention of the authors:</p><p>Some sentences in the results (line 260-263) are repeated.</p><p>Clear implications of some of the findings e.g DOR for each test is not clear. The study could be more useful to both clinicians and policy makers. How these results are found useful to these groups is not explicit.</p><p>The recommendation, Using a point of care HPV screen test lacks clear basis. No costs analysis nor test acceptability comparisons were done in this study.</p><p>There is lack of consistency in writing the references. Some follow the standard sentence case, others have predominant capital letters. This needs to be corrected.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
