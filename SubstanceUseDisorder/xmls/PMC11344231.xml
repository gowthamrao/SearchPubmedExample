First, our review may not include all analyses of the association between the ACA and health among people with criminal legal involvement. Second, because of the exploratory nature of our study, we defined the intervention, population, and outcomes of interest broadly to capture as many studies as possible. Variation in these definitions limits cross-study comparability and constrains our ability to draw conclusive implications for research and policy. Third, our review does not explicitly address quality of care, only access to care. Investigating how quality of care for people with criminal legal involvement changed following the ACA may qualify or help clarify the conflicting results we find with respect to access to care. Fourth, more than half of our included studies draw from only 2 data sources: the NSDUH and TEDS-A datasets. This fact is likely because the linkage of health and criminal legal data are rare, and NSDUH is one of the only surveys to collect both data types simultaneously. Finally, our study did not examine the particular mechanisms linking the ACA and its constituent provisions to the outcomes analyzed within our population of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI240049"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this scoping review, we summarized 19 observational and quasi-experimental studies assessing the association between the ACA and outcomes relating to access to care, health insurance, health, social welfare, and costs of care among people with criminal legal involvement.

Researchers can also probe the mechanisms of the ACA&#8217;s association with improved insurance coverage and reduced recidivism among people with criminal legal involvement. To this end, researchers may find prudent to leverage the variation in prerelease Medicaid enrollment assistance under some states&#8217; Social Security Act Section 1115 demonstrations, which directly connect people with criminal legal involvement to Medicaid coverage.<sup><xref rid="aoi240049r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240049r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240049r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Such Medicaid enrollment assistance programs have the potential to increase enrollment rates and use of health care.
