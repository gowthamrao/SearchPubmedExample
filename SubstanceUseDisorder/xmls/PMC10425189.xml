Skin abscesses and cellulitis around injecting sites are the most frequent problems, with surveys of people who inject drugs finding lifetime prevalence ranging from 6% to 69% [<xref rid="ciad144-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Invasive infections are also common; the rate of hospital admission for infective endocarditis among people injecting heroin in London is 44 times higher than in the general population [<xref rid="ciad144-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast to viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C, which are transmitted in blood via shared injecting equipment, injecting-associated bacterial infections are usually caused by patients&#8217; own skin and mouth flora, typically gram-positive cocci [<xref rid="ciad144-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;7</xref>]. Infections can also be caused by bacterial spores contaminating drugs, though this is rare [<xref rid="ciad144-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Data from hospitals suggest that the number of injection-associated infections has increased since the early 2000s in many countries, including England [<xref rid="ciad144-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Norway [<xref rid="ciad144-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the United States [<xref rid="ciad144-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Canada [<xref rid="ciad144-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Australia [<xref rid="ciad144-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and India [<xref rid="ciad144-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In North America, this may be due to increases in prescription opioid dependence and subsequent increases in injection of illicit opioids [<xref rid="ciad144-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to the increasing prevalence of illicit opioid use, fentanyl has become more common in the illicit drug market and is associated with more frequent injection, which in turn leads to more reuse and sharing of equipment [<xref rid="ciad144-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the incidence of infections has also increased in England despite stable or decreasing prevalence of illicit opioid use [<xref rid="ciad144-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the continued rarity of synthetic opioids in the illicit drug supply [<xref rid="ciad144-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One common factor between North America and England is the increased use of stimulants [<xref rid="ciad144-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], often in combination with opioids, which is associated with more frequent injection and risk of infections. However, the reasons for increasing incidence in different countries are not known.</p><p>Although many studies have described long-term trends in injection-associated infections, few have investigated seasonal and short-term trends. Many other infections have seasonal patterns that have informed public health responses, such as seasonal immunization campaigns and heightened hospital infection control measures in winter. Bacterial skin infections in the general population are more common in summer [<xref rid="ciad144-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and studies in New York in the 1990s and Stockholm between 2007 and 2018 suggest that the rate of injection-associated infections is also higher in summer [<xref rid="ciad144-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of many infections was affected by the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nonpharmaceutical interventions included restrictions on movement, closure of public places, behavioral advice, and support for vulnerable groups including improved housing (more detail is provided in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>). These interventions had a dramatic effect on seasonal respiratory infections but also reduced many nonrespiratory infections [<xref rid="ciad144-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and may have affected injection-associated infections.</p><p>The role of external influences such as seasons and the COVID-19 response could inform our understanding of infection dynamics and determinants of risk, and therefore how infections could be prevented. We used hospital data from England to describe long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of COVID-19 public health responses.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ciad144-s0"><title>METHODS</title><p>We did a descriptive time series analysis of trends in opioid injection&#8211;associated bacterial infections.</p><sec id="ciad144-s0.1"><title>Data Source</title><p>We used the Hospital Episode Statistics database, which includes clinical information about patients admitted to all National Health Service hospitals in England [<xref rid="ciad144-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We included emergency admissions in which the admission date was between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2021, and the patient was aged between 15 and 64 years at admission.</p><p>Hospital Episode Statistics is a database of episodes of care led by a single doctor or medical team; therefore, a hospital admission can include multiple records. To avoid double counting, we only included the first episode in each admission.</p><p>We included patients with a primary diagnosis of cutaneous abscess, cellulitis, other skin and soft tissue infections, phlebitis, or thrombophlebitis (grouped as &#8220;localized infections&#8221;), endocarditis, septicemia, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, or necrotizing fasciitis (grouped as &#8220;invasive infections&#8221;). International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), codes for these diagnoses are listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>. We defined &#8220;opioid injection-associated infections&#8221; as those with a secondary diagnosis of opioid use disorder.</p><p>A cohort study of community-recruited people who use illicit opioids found that 53% of participants admitted to hospital because of the infections listed here had a secondary diagnosis of opioid use disorder [<xref rid="ciad144-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and this proportion was stable over time. This suggests that our method captures approximately half of opioid injection-associated infections and produces valid time trends.</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s0.2"><title>Variables</title><p>For each patient, we extracted the primary diagnosis, age at admission, sex, ethnicity, duration of admission, mode of discharge (standard, self-discharge, died, or other), Index of Multiple Deprivation (a measure of the socioeconomic status of the patient's neighborhood [<xref rid="ciad144-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), whether the patient was known to be homeless (defined as having &#8220;no fixed abode&#8221; or the ICD-10 code Z59.0; &#8220;homelessness&#8221;), whether the patient had an unplanned hospital admission within 28 days following discharge, and whether an operative procedure was performed during the admission.</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s0.3"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We described the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients. To investigate seasonality and the change in rate associated with COVID-19 response, we focused on hospital admissions on or after 1 January 2015 and aggregated the data into daily counts. We used a Poisson model with a dependent variable of the count of admissions per day. Independent variables were a linear term for time defined as the number of days after 1 January 2015, an interaction term between time and a binary indicator for before/after 23 March 2020 (the date when strict COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in England), and a harmonic term over the calendar year with 2 sine and cosine pairs. The interaction term estimates a step-change and a change of slope, and the harmonic term estimates seasonality [<xref rid="ciad144-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We reported the day of year when the peak and low predicted admissions occurred, and estimated magnitude of seasonality as the ratio between the peak and low, with confidence intervals (CI) estimated using a Monte-Carlo method.</p><p>We repeated these procedures for invasive infections in isolation and 2 other patient groups: (1) staphylococcal and streptococcal skin infections that did not have a secondary diagnosis of opioid use disorder (reflective of infections in the general population, presumed unrelated to drug use) and (2) noninfectious complications of drug use, using 2 of the UK government's measures for tracking drug-related health harms [<xref rid="ciad144-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]: &#8220;admissions for drug-related mental and behavioral disorders&#8221;, and &#8220;admissions for poisoning by drug misuse.&#8221; The purpose of these comparisons was to help us interpret time trends in opioid injection&#8211;associated infections; in particular, whether time trends are driven by changes in drug use behaviors or by microbiological factors that may also affect the wider population.</p><p>We also did a supplementary analysis to test if COVID-19 was associated with a change in the clinical severity of patients admitted to hospital with opioid injection&#8211;associated infections. We compared admissions in the 12 months before and after 23 March 2020, in terms of the duration of admissions, the proportion that died, and the proportion of infections that were invasive. If COVID-19 was associated with reduced accessibility of hospitals, we expected an increased severity of admissions.</p><p>Analysis was done using SQL and R version 4.2.1.

This sustained reduction in injecting-related infections happened over a period when injection of illicit opioids likely did not reduce. The seasonality of infections is parallel to skin infections in the general population, which may suggest that environmental and microbiological factors such as circulation of bacteria affect the risk of infection among people who inject drugs.</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s2.2"><title>Comparison With Other Studies</title><p>Studies in various countries have found that the incidence of bacterial infections among people who inject drugs increased before COVID-19 [<xref rid="ciad144-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#8211;14</xref>], though the reasons for this general increase are unclear. In the United Kingdom, few people started injecting in the past 10 years [<xref rid="ciad144-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the population size appears stable [<xref rid="ciad144-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; therefore, the increase is likely because of increasing risk for individuals.</p><p>We considered 4 potential explanations for increasing injection-associated infections in England between 2011 and 2019. First, an increase in injection of crack cocaine, which is associated with more frequent injecting and higher risk of infections. Cross-sectional surveys of people who inject drugs in England show that 36% (95% CI, 33&#8211;38) recently injected crack cocaine in 2012, compared with 57% (95% CI, 55&#8211;60) in 2019 [<xref rid="ciad144-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Second, increasing homelessness, which is associated with bacterial infections because of lack of a clean area to inject and poor access to injecting equipment [<xref rid="ciad144-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Homelessness in England increased over this period; for example, the number of rough sleepers identified by street outreach teams in London increased by 71% between 2012 and 2020 [<xref rid="ciad144-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The prevalence of homelessness in our sample follows the same pattern. Third, increasing average age and duration of injecting, which may be associated with vascular damage and injecting intramuscularly or in more colonized parts of the body such as the groin. The median time since people first injected psychoactive drugs in England increased from 7 years in 2002 to 18 years in 2019 [<xref rid="ciad144-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this demographic change occurred gradually over the whole period in the present study, whereas the rate of injection-associated infections reduced between 2002 and 2011 and then increased. Fourth, cuts to needle and syringe programs and wound care provided within community health services that treat opioid use disorder. Funding cuts since 2013 have meant these community services have lost clinical skills and now have limited scope for holistic care [<xref rid="ciad144-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>We observed a sudden reduction in injection-associated infections at the start of COVID-19 restrictions. We considered 3 potential explanations. First, COVID-19 may have led to reduced healthcare access and a lower probability that an individual with an infection would be admitted to the hospital. However, most evidence suggests that reduced hospital access was short-term. Admissions because of noncommunicable diseases such as self-harm [<xref rid="ciad144-B35" ref-type="bibr">35&#8211;37</xref>] and acute cardiovascular events [<xref rid="ciad144-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reduced in the weeks after public health measures were introduced in March 2020, but typically returned to prepandemic trends by September 2020. In our data, there was no large step-change in March 2020 in admissions for noninfectious complications of opioid use, suggesting that the accessibility of hospitals did not reduce suddenly for people who use illicit drugs. Further supporting this, we did not observe an increase in the clinical severity of patients admitted with infections during COVID-19, and invasive infections reduced to a similar degree as localized infections. Second, the reduction in infections may be due to reduced drug use. However, opioid-related deaths continued to increase in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="ciad144-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and qualitative evidence suggests that many people continued to inject drugs [<xref rid="ciad144-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Third, the nonpharmaceutical interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission may have reduced transmission of bacteria such as Staphylococci and Streptococci among people who inject drugs. This was the case for many infections in the general population. In contrast to noninfectious causes of hospital admissions, which &#8220;rebounded&#8221; in 2020, there were sustained reductions throughout 2020 and 2021 in healthcare use related to many viral and bacterial infections [<xref rid="ciad144-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results show that this sustained reduction was evident for injection-associated infections.</p><p>We also found that injection-associated infections were more common in summer. To our knowledge, this pattern has only been observed in 2 small studies [<xref rid="ciad144-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ciad144-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This pattern has been observed for Staphylococcal infections generally [<xref rid="ciad144-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which may be due to sweating and proliferation of colonized bacteria, insect bites, or close contact for example via contact sports. An alternative theory to seasonality in colonization or transmission of bacteria is that that drug use is more common in summer. This may be supported by the higher rate of noninfectious complications of opioid use in summer; however, other data suggest that opioid-related deaths do not follow this seasonal pattern [<xref rid="ciad144-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s2.3"><title>Implications for Policy and Practice</title><p>Most interventions to reduce the risk of injection-associated bacterial infections have focused on individual behaviors such as skin cleaning and using sterile and sharp needles [<xref rid="ciad144-B44" ref-type="bibr">44&#8211;46</xref>]. These behaviors are effective but interventions promoting their use have mixed outcomes and have not reduced the population incidence of infections. In contrast, we observed that the public health interventions to control COVID-19 had a dramatic effect on injection-associated infections. In the United Kingdom, the most important intervention in relation to people who inject drugs may be closure of congregate homeless settings (such as night shelters) and an offer of hotel-based accommodation for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic [<xref rid="ciad144-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This intervention meant that many people previously injecting drugs in public places now had their own bathroom and a more hygienic place to prepare drugs. Other relevant interventions included reduced social mixing throughout the population and promotion of hand hygiene. The results suggest that interventions that improve accommodation and living standards are likely to have a greater effect on the rate of infections than behavioral advice.</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s2.4"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>We used a national database capturing all hospital admissions at National Health Service hospitals in England, which used the diagnostic coding system ICD-10 throughout the 20-year study. The database excludes private hospitals where the patient pays, though these hospitals account for a small minority of hospital activity and are typically used by wealthier people for elective procedures.</p><p>There are 4 key limitations. First, COVID-19 was associated with multiple policy and social changes, and we cannot determine which of these changes caused the reduction in injection-associated infections. Our comparisons with skin infections in the general population and noninfectious complications of opioid use provide clues that nonpharmaceutical interventions may have improved the risk environment (rather than reduced drug use), but this is not a definitive answer. Second, by using hospital inpatient data, we only captured severe infections. It is possible that the threshold for hospital admission changed over the study period and particularly during COVID-19 responses, either because of hospital policies or patient behaviors such as fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospital and the desire not to burden health services. However, we did not find that COVID-19 was associated with an increase in the clinical severity of patients admitted with injection-associated infections. Third, our definition of injection-associated infections may capture some patients who use opioids, but the infection was not caused by injection, for example the entry point may have been an insect bite or viral lesion. This is difficult to quantify, but in a cohort of people who inject heroin in London, the rate of bacterial infections was 50 times greater than in the general population, suggesting that most bacterial infections in this population are associated with injecting [<xref rid="ciad144-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Fourth, coding practices may change over time, and our results would be particularly sensitive to a change in the recording of opioid use disorder as a secondary diagnosis. We used a cohort of people who use illicit opioids to show that the recording of this diagnosis appears stable over time [<xref rid="ciad144-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ciad144-s2.5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The risk of bacterial infections among people who inject drugs changes over both the long and short term, including a substantial reduction associated with COVID-19 public health measures.
