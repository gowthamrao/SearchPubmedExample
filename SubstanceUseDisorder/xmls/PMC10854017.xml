As EDs typically address urgent mental health crises, revisiting an ED may represent unmet mental health needs. Accurate ED revisit prediction could aid early intervention and ensure efficient healthcare resource allocation. We examine the potential increased accuracy and performance of graph neural network (GNN) machine learning models compared to recurrent neural network (RNN), and baseline conventional machine learning and regression models for predicting ED revisit in electronic health record (EHR) data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study used EHR data for children and youth aged 4&#8211;17 seeking services at McMaster Children&#8217;s Hospital&#8217;s Child and Youth Mental Health Program outpatient service to develop and evaluate GNN and RNN models to predict whether a child/youth with an ED visit had an ED revisit within 30&#8201;days. GNN and RNN models were developed and compared against conventional baseline models. Model performance for GNN, RNN, XGBoost, decision tree and logistic regression models was evaluated using F1 scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The GNN model outperformed the RNN model by an F1-score increase of 0.0511 and the best performing conventional machine learning model by an F1-score increase of 0.0470. Precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and positive and negative predictive values showed that the GNN model performed the best, and the RNN model performed similarly to the XGBoost model. Performance increases were most noticeable for recall and negative predictive value than for precision and positive predictive value.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This study demonstrates the improved accuracy and potential utility of GNN models in predicting ED revisits among children and youth, although model performance may not be sufficient for clinical implementation. Given the improvements in recall and negative predictive value, GNN models should be further explored to develop algorithms that can inform clinical decision-making in ways that facilitate targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation, and improve outcomes for children and youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12911-024-02450-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Graph neural network</kwd><kwd>Deep learning</kwd><kwd>Emergency department</kwd><kwd>Revisits</kwd><kwd>Prediction</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">Child and youth (herein child/youth) mental health disorders affect approximately 1 in 5 Canadian children/youth and left untreated can lead to chronic difficulties and negative downstream effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Research on pediatric mental health-related ED revisits in BC reported decreases in high-acuity visits and increases in mid-acuity level visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mental health support in an ED provides immediate safety for emergent conditions through crisis intervention or referrals to specialized or community resources. Individuals with lower acuity may opt to visit an ED because appropriate community resources were unavailable in the needed timeframe. Visiting an ED when less resource-intensive services may be clinically appropriate could lead to wasted or misdirected resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Accurate prediction of children/youth who are at risk of an ED revisit could allow for early identification and targeted interventions to prevent the escalation of crises and increased acuity. From an organizational perspective, better targeting of the response in accordance with acuity level increases efficiency in the allocation of healthcare resources.</p><p id="Par20">Machine-based algorithmic approaches show promise for tapping into the predictive value of electronic health record (EHR) data to support child/youth mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In contrast with traditional machine learning, or &#8216;shallow&#8217; learning, deep learning uses artificial neural networks&#8212;inspired by the organization and function of the brain&#8212;to extract meaningful patterns and representations from complex data. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models process sequential and time series medical history and visit data over time, focusing on the ordering of events but not accounting for bidirectional relationships. RNN models consider past inputs in predictions that accurately capture temporal dependencies in the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Graph neural network (GNN) approaches go further in accounting for temporal, interdependent, and multidirectional relationships in EHR data by using graph structures to capture complex relationships between symptoms, treatments, and patient characteristics. Graphs are mathematical representations of networks composed of nodes (different variables or features representing individuals, objects, or concepts) and edges (connections or relationships between variables illustrating how nodes are linked within the graph) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While RNN models capture event order, GNN models consider event order, other types of connections (e.g. spatial relationships, multimodal dependencies, semantic associations), and the influence these connections have on each other. Despite offering a better fit to EHR data, the application of GNN models to ED revisit prediction&#160;is underexplored.</p><p id="Par21">Predictive modeling for revisit, readmission and other health encounter prediction has used traditional logistic regression models, classical machine learning models and, to a lesser extent, deep learning models including RNNs and GNNs.

Our goal was to determine whether GNN models can be applied to child/youth EHR data to predict 30-day ED revisit from a sample of children/youth who were in contact with mental health outpatient services between 2011 and 2021 and who had at least one ED visit between 2002 and July 2021.

Our results can inform the development of AI-assisted decision-making tools for healthcare providers, enabling early identification of at-risk children/youth and targeted interventions to reduce ED visit and revisit rates. The application of these advanced computational approaches can contribute to a better understanding of the complex dynamics involved in child/youth health service utilization, ultimately informing policy and clinical decision-making processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Dataset</title><p id="Par26">McMaster Children&#8217;s Hospital (MCH) is one of Canada&#8217;s largest pediatric hospitals serving South-Central Ontario offering inpatient, outpatient and ED mental health care to children and youth. While most children/youth dealing with mental health difficulties are discharged from the ED with referrals to outpatient services, some are admitted for inpatient care before being referred for follow-up care. While receiving outpatient services, children/youth may visit or revisit the ED for urgent care. The study used retrospective administrative health records for 6152 child/youth outpatients aged 4 to 17 who sought services at MCH&#8217;s Child and Youth Mental Health Program outpatient service between June 2011 and April 2021. These child/youth&#8217;s&#160;medical record numbers were linked to their administrative health records from April 2002 to July 2021 in the Meditech EHR system, including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visit data for MCH-based services. From these 6152 children/youth, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) data were used to identify those who had at least one ED visit (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4473).

All features were static and attached to each visit. Date of visit was used to temporally order visits and the order (not date or time between visits) was captured in the patient graph. One drawback of GNN models is that due to their complexity and ability to capture non-linearity in the data, they are inherently non-interpretable. Using interpretability techniques to extract feature importance metrics was beyond the scope of our study.

Different types of connections were established between nodes, such as visit-visit, visit-service, and service-diagnosis connections.

The GNN allowed aggregate node representations in a single graph representation and used this representation for classifications. The graphs accommodate multiple visits, getting larger or smaller depending on the visit number.

To address this, undersampling techniques were used to create five data subsets and the model was trained and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation for each subset following best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. First, five random samples of 768 unique children/youth from the group without an ED revisit were selected. Each random sample was separately merged with the 768 children/youth with an ED revisit to create a separate balanced dataset, resulting in five balanced datasets. For each of these a five-fold cross validation approach was used to train and evaluate the models, in which the dataset was split into five equally sized &#8216;folds&#8217;. In each step of the five-fold cross validation, four of the five folds are selected as the training set and the remaining fold as the test set. This process is repeated until each fold has been used as the test set exactly once. A performance score was obtained for each fold.

Deep learning RNN models can consider the sequence of visits but GNN models also consider interconnections between different types of information (i.e. features). This provides opportunities for developing prediction models that better represent the structure of administrative health data and so may better inform the development of models that help to target interventions aimed at reducing revisit rates, potentially improving healthcare resource planning and allocation in child/youth mental health.</p><p id="Par38">This study demonstrates the increased ability of GNN models to capture complexities in EHR data and their potential value and improved performance for predicting ED revisits among children/youth compared to RNNs, baseline conventional machine learning and regression models. The GNN model outperformed the RNN model by .0511 in F1 scores&#8212;a moderate improvement. The XGBoost model performance was similar to the RNN model. Model accuracy did not reach the commonly used 0.7 threshold meaning that the performance may not be sufficient for clinical implementation without further model refinement. Other studies of treatment outcomes in child/youth mental health are scarce but those that exist report accuracies of over 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. RNN models for hospital and ICU readmission prediction report AUROC values ranging from 0.66 to 0.80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our best performing models had an AUROC of 0.70 which is in line with existing models.</p><p id="Par39">Precision and positive predictive value of GNN, RNN and XGBoost models were comparable, but the performance improvement of the GNN model was more evident for recall and negative predictive value. While the models predict which children/youth will have an ED revisit with similar performance, the GNN model was best able to predict which children/youth will <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> revisit the ED. This is important when considering the clinical implications of incorrectly identifying a child/youth at risk for revisit and providing some intervention or treatment that may not be needed.</p><p id="Par40">The strengths of this study include the following. First, our study has a large sample size in a field that typically suffers from small samples, despite focusing on a single site and a rare event (i.e. ED revisit). Second, external validation of the model will be possible in nationally available NACRS data. Externally validating these models independently with new individuals will reveal the extent to which models are generalizable to other settings, whether model performance improves in provincial or national data, and whether wider application is feasible. Third, we apply novel deep learning models in a field where these types of models have not been used, generating new evidence about their potential utility. The findings suggest that GNN models leverage the relationships present in patient EHR data leading to improved model performance compared to baseline models.</p><p id="Par41">There are also study limitations. First, due to the lack of valid and reliable case definitions for mental health-related ED visits in EHR data, it was not possible to develop models specific to mental health-related reasons. This is a challenge faced by all prediction models that rely only on diagnostic codes in EHR data. While it will be important to determine whether GNN models can be developed for mental health-related ED revisits, this was beyond the scope of our current project. Another area for future exploration is the extension of deep learning models to predict any ED visit (not only revisit) among children/youth who both do and do not visit the ED. This requires data fusion to combine ED visit data with other EHR and non-EHR-data that are collected for all patients, not only those accessing the ED. Data fusion comes with its own challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] but being able to identify children/youth more likely to visit the ED has clinical utility. Data fusion would also allow access to demographic characteristics other than age, which were not available in the EHR data we used and so limited exploration of their influence on ED utilization. Second, the lack of GNN and RNN models in child/youth ED revisit prediction means we are limited in our ability to evaluate model performance against other models. It is unknown if the threshold of F1&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.7 is a reasonable one in this context. A lower criterion may be appropriate and indicative of clinical utility. Third, our data includes visits that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when ED visit patterns changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, only 2 of the 19&#8201;years of data accessed were during the pandemic. Further validation of the model in post-pandemic data will be important, although it is likely that healthcare pressures resulting in different visit patterns and demands still exist even though the acute stage of the pandemic has passed. Finally, given the complexity level of GNN models, it was not possible to export feature importance information which can provide insights into the most important features in the prediction, particularly when comparing models. The benefits GNNs offer in their ability to better capture complex, non-linear, visit data comes at the cost of easy interpretability. Interpretability techniques are being developed for deep learning models and finding appropriate approaches is an important area for further investigation. Future work needed across all applications of machine learning relate to: 1) model fairness and bias; 2)&#160;acceptability and ethics of using machine learning models with data about children, youth and their families; and 3)&#160;education and training of clinicians to ensure potential model users understand how predictive models have been developed and their potential limitations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">This is an exciting time for the exploration of machine learning prediction models to enhance clinical decision-making. This study demonstrates the improved accuracy and potential utility of GNN models in predicting ED revisits among children and youth. Given the improvements in recall and negative predictive value, GNN models should be further explored to develop algorithms that can inform clinical decision-making in ways that facilitate targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation, and improve outcomes for children and youth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
