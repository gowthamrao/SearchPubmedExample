We aimed to approximate the rate of alcohol and drug use screening in Canadian pediatric patients admitted for trauma in our centre, determine the prevalence of intoxication on admission and compare the injury characteristics and morbidity of patients with and without concomitant substance use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a single-centre retrospective review of the Stollery Children&#8217;s Hospital&#8217;s medical records abstracted from the Alberta Trauma Registry database of patients aged 12&#8211;17 years who were admitted for trauma (Injury Severity Score &#8805; 12) between Jan. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2021.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 543 patients included in the analysis, 380 (70.0%) received screening for alcohol as a part of their trauma panel; meanwhile, only 5 (0.9%) patients were screened for drug use. Among the patients who were screened for alcohol, 47 (12.4%) had a positive blood alcohol level (BAC). Nine (7%) of 129 screened patients aged 12&#8211;14 years were found to have positive BACs compared with 38 (15.1%) of 251 screened patients aged 15&#8211;17 years. Patient age and mechanism of injury significantly affected rates of screening. Among patients with positive BACs on admission, the 3 most prevalent mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accident (26 [55.3%]), assault (13 [27.7%]) and recreational vehicle accidents (4 [8.5%]). Patients with a positive BAC sustained significantly more severe injuries (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>These results provide evidence of the importance of standardized screening to identify pediatric patients admitted for trauma who are in need of treatment for alcohol and drug use. The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment model is the primary approach used to fulfill substance use identification and intervention recommendations. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble questionnaire are most suitable for adolescent populations.</p></sec></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="fr"><sec><title>Contexte:</title><p>Les centres de traumatologie p&#233;diatrique de niveau 1 devraient effectuer un test d&#8217;alcool&#233;mie et offrir des interventions en toxicomanie &#224; tous les jeunes polytraumatis&#233;s de 12 ans et plus qu&#8217;ils re&#231;oivent afin de pr&#233;venir les rechutes.

Over the last several years, the department has made a concerted effort to increase rates of alcohol screening in pediatric patients by including BAC screening in the prepopulated laboratory order set for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older admitted for trauma &#8212; this imitates standard practice in adult patients admitted for trauma. This is in contrast to other emergency departments around the country, where BAC screens are usually ordered on a case-by-case basis. We also recently underwent trauma accreditation, and that process has focused our emergency department team efforts for screening.</p><p>Although patient sex did not affect rates of screening, our study identified substantial variation in screening based on patient age and mechanism of injury. Patients aged 12&#8211;14 years were found to be 1.42 times more likely to have BAC screening omitted than patients aged 15&#8211;17 years. Among screened patients aged 12&#8211;14 years, 7% still registered a positive BAC on admission. This finding suggests that substance use may begin early in adolescence and that clinicians may wrongfully discount the possibility of concomitant substance use in trauma owing to the patient&#8217;s younger age. This is problematic because accurately identifying substance use in patients aged 12&#8211;14 years is of vital importance, as patients who begin using alcohol at this age are more than 10 times more likely to develop lifetime alcohol dependence than adults.<xref rid="b8-066e321" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Further, it was also found that adolescents injured in MVAs were 1.35 times more likely to be screened than those with other mechanisms of injury. It is likely that alcohol screens are completed with greater consistency in this population owing to ubiquitous awareness of the association between intoxication and MVAs. These associations suggest that toxicological screens continue to be completed inconsistently and that subjective clinical suspicion of intoxication substantially affects whether clinicians will elect to conduct alcohol screening in patients admitted for trauma. Omission of screening from the standard trauma panel results in the discharge of pediatric patients who would have benefitted from intervention for their alcohol use. This leads to a significant number of adolescents experiencing greater long-term morbidity and death from their substance use as well as from the increased likelihood that they will experience recurrent trauma.</p><p>Although our study found relatively high levels of alcohol screening (70%), it was concerning to find that almost no patients received drug screening. Among our patient cohort (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 543), only 5 patients were tested for intoxication from drugs. Consequently, it was not possible to determine an accurate rate of drug use in our trauma population, and there was insufficient power to conduct meaningful analyses between groups of patients. However, we believe that the prevalence of drug use, and in particular marijuana use, was significant in our trauma population and went uncaptured owing to lack of drug testing. This conjecture is based on previous single-centre studies in the United States that found substantial rates of positive screens for marijuana in pediatric patients admitted for trauma. These studies identified minimum prevalence of marijuana intoxication in their pediatric patients admitted for trauma of at least 8.3%&#8211;10.2%.<xref rid="b6-066e321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b12-066e321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b19-066e321" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We hypothesize that the reason we observed substantially lower rates of drug screening than alcohol screening is because clinicians tend to view alcohol status as more important to understanding the acute clinical picture of patients admitted for trauma. For example, delineating alcohol intoxication from neurological injury is of high clinical utility, whereas knowledge of current use or history of using many types of drugs is less immediately imperative. Further, the majority of observations in our study occurred before the legalization of marijuana in Canada, before which physicians may have had lower suspicion of pediatric use of marijuana. However, rates of marijuana use reached 18% in adolescents in grades 7&#8211;12 in 2019,<xref rid="b22-066e321" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and recent studies report that youth presenting to the emergency department with cannabis-related problems are significantly younger in the post-legalization period.<xref rid="b23-066e321" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, it is imperative that clinicians begin to increase the rate of routine screening for drug use in pediatric patients admitted for trauma to identify those who require interventions for drug use.</p><p>Whereas the prevalence of alcohol intoxication in adults admitted for trauma is well described, considerably less data describing the adolescent population are available. We found that 12.4% of screened pediatric patients admitted for trauma had a positive BAC test. This is consistent with positivity rates reported in previous studies, which varied from 9.5% to 14%.<xref rid="b6-066e321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b17-066e321" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b19-066e321" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Among patients who tested positive, the average BAC was 0.098 g/dL, which suggests substantial intoxication associated with binge drinking, causing considerable impairment of decision-making and motor function.<xref rid="b24-066e321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Previous studies<xref rid="b12-066e321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> show the likelihood of positive BAC increased with age as the positivity rate for BAC was twice as high in patients aged 15&#8211;17 years than in those aged 12&#8211;14 years. Although considerably more male than female patients were admitted to the Stollery for trauma, female patients were substantially more likely to test positive for BAC on screening: 19.5% compared with 9.4%, representing a test positivity rate 2.07 times higher in female than male patients. We believe that this somewhat counterintuitive finding may be explained by a combination of factors. Unlike in the adult population, where males exhibit higher rates of alcohol consumption, there is no difference between males and females in rates of drinking or heavy drinking in the adolescent age demographic (12&#8211; 17 yr).<xref rid="b25-066e321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-066e321" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Rates of problematic drinking behaviours, such as alcohol use disorder, are more than 1.6 times higher in females aged 12&#8211;17 years than males of the same age.<xref rid="b27-066e321" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In addition, males engage in more high-risk behaviour in a sober state than females, which may explain the reduced alcohol screen positivity rate in male patients admitted for trauma in relation to females.<xref rid="b28-066e321" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-066e321" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>We have shown that injury characteristics and mechanisms differed between patients who tested positive than negative for BAC. A major finding was that patients who tested positive for BAC sustained significantly more severe injuries than those who tested negative for BAC, with average ISS of 25 and 21.9 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.003), respectively. We believe that severity of injury is associated with alcohol status because of the specific mechanisms of injury that had high incidence in patients who tested positive for BAC. The 3 mechanisms of injury with the greatest proportion of patients testing positive for alcohol intoxication were assault (28.3%), MVA (12.2%) and suicide or self-harm (8.8%). Patients sustaining trauma from an assault were more than 4 times more likely to screen positive for alcohol intoxication than from all other causes of injury, whereas patients sustaining trauma from an MVA were nearly twice as likely to screen positive. Most (83%) of the intoxicated patients sustained their injuries from either an MVA or assault, and these mechanisms are more associated with severe multisystem trauma than other causes of injury. Despite a relatively high positivity rate of alcohol screening in patients sustaining trauma from suicide attempts or self-harm, the positivity rate did not significantly differ from that associated with other causes of injury.</p><p>Motor vehicle accidents accounted for more than half of all traumatic injuries in patients who were intoxicated in our study and are still potentially under-represented owing to the lethality of MVAs, the leading cause of death among adolescents.<xref rid="b30-066e321" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This is unsurprising as studies have shown that driving with a BAC of 0.08% is associated with a relative risk of an accident of 2.69,<xref rid="b31-066e321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> whereas youth aged 16&#8211;20 years achieve a comparable level of risk with a BAC of only 0.02%&#8211;0.04%.<xref rid="b32-066e321" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Further, a BAC of 0.07%&#8211; 0.10% is associated with risky road-crossing decisions and pedestrian fatalities.<xref rid="b33-066e321" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, while a prevalence of alcohol intoxication of 12% is substantial, our study&#8217;s inability to capture rates of intoxication from marijuana may result in an underestimation of the true rate of intoxication associated with MVAs. This inference is based on Canadian rates of alcohol and marijuana use before operating a vehicle as well as their known associated relative risks of MVAs.<xref rid="b34-066e321" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The prevalence of driving under the influence of cannabis among youth has surpassed the prevalence of driving while intoxicated,<xref rid="b35-066e321" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-066e321" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> with 7% of Canadian youth in grades 10&#8211;12 who have a driver&#8217;s licence reporting having used cannabis within 1 hour of operating a vehicle compared with only 4% reporting having consumed alcohol within 1 hour.<xref rid="b34-066e321" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Further, the relative risk of a crash associated with driving under the influence of cannabis is about double that of an unimpaired driver.<xref rid="b31-066e321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus, based on the similarities between known prevalence of alcohol and cannabis use before operating a vehicle as well as similarities in their associated RRs of MVAs, we propose that it is possible that the true prevalence of combined cannabis and alcohol intoxication in MVAs in our study population may be more than double our reported rate.</p><p>These results provide further evidence of the importance of accurately identifying pediatric patients admitted for trauma who are in need of treatment for alcohol and drug use. The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) model is the primary approach used to fulfill substance use identification and intervention recommendations.<xref rid="b14-066e321" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b37-066e321" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In executing SBIRT, it is best practice to administer a validated substance use disorder identification survey in addition to toxicological screening.<xref rid="b6-066e321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b12-066e321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This comprehensive approach is important as many patients test negative for acute intoxication on laboratory screening but are later confirmed positive for a substance use disorder when assessed with a validated survey.<xref rid="b6-066e321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b16-066e321" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition to reducing false-negative screening results, the validated survey helps to contextualize positive toxicological screens and elicit information about substance use patterns. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) questionnaire are most suitable for adolescent populations; the CRAFFT questionnaire is preferred owing to its brevity and high sensitivity.<xref rid="b38-066e321" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Patients screening positive receive standardized, brief interventions in the form of motivational interviews regarding the consequences and dangers of substance use.<xref rid="b39-066e321" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This is followed by referral to appropriate child mental health or addiction treatment. Previous studies have shown that brief intervention in adolescent patients being treated for alcohol-related injuries decreases future alcohol consumption, frequency of driving while intoxicated and incidence of alcohol-related injuries.<xref rid="b40-066e321" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Consequently, SBIRT may represent a particularly economical aspect of treatment in pediatric patients admitted for trauma, as intervention at a young age to prevent future injury and morbidity from substance use has the potential to result in considerable improvements to life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years.<xref rid="b41-066e321" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study had several limitations. We did not capture patients who sustained minor trauma as our analysis was limited to patients with an ISS of 12 or more. The generalizability of our findings are inherently limited by the fact that our study was carried out in a single level 1 trauma centre. Although we believe that the diverse geographical and social contexts of hospitals contained within the centre&#8217;s catchment zone allow for considerable generalizability of our findings, performance of a similar analysis using a national trauma database would maximize representativeness for the Canadian population. Lastly, because of the nonrandom nature by which physicians conducted their screening, our estimations of alcohol and drug use prevalence in trauma are limited by selection bias. Therefore, to obtain true prevalence estimates, we recommend that a future prospective cohort study be conducted with universal toxicological screening.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that alcohol and drug screening was inconsistently conducted in pediatric patients admitted for trauma. Despite finding a substantial prevalence of substance use across all demographics, younger patients and patients sustaining non-MVA traumas were more likely to have screening omitted from their trauma care &#8212; an indication that subjective clinical suspicion of intoxication is a likely contributor to low screening rates. Implicit bias and practice patterns may affect physicians&#8217; decision to initiate screening. Greater efforts must be made to universally screen for alcohol and drug use in patients aged 12 years and older admitted for trauma by way of toxicological screening as well as through the use of a validated substance use survey. Trauma centres should also be capable of administering brief interventions and referring patients to suitable mental health and substance use treatments when appropriate. Increased rates of screening and intervention will allow centres the opportunity to reduce future morbidity from substance abuse and trauma recidivism in adolescents.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-066e321"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Both authors designed the study.
