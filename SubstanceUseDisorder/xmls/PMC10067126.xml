</xref> Tobacco cessation services are essential to comprehensive cancer care and should be offered to all patients with a cancer diagnosis. Our single&#8208;institution cancer center sought to create and implement a tobacco cessation program within our cancer center. This manuscript depicts the patient population referred to our program over the first 2&#8208;year period, as well as quit rates, rates of pharmacotherapy usage, and patient factors associated with engagement with cessation services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cam45423-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><p>Our NCI&#8208;designated comprehensive cancer center received funding through a supplemental grant to our comprehensive cancer center grant, specifically the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) funding mechanism, which was designed to provide funding for cancer centers to establish tobacco cessation programs. This funding mechanism was established in 2018 and will complete in 2022. Our cancer center received funding in the second cohort of institutions (three cohorts total), in 2018 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="cam45423-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After approximately 12&#8201;months of planning, we launched our program in July 2019.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="cam45423-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Map of National Cancer Institute&#8208;designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers that received funding from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I), which provides funding for cancer centers to establish tobacco cessation programs nationwide.

Patients were also able to self&#8208;refer to the program, and promotional materials were available at all outpatient clinics. Patients were included in the study if they were current smokers and expressed an interest in a referral to the Winship Cancer Center tobacco cessation program between July 2019 and August 2021. They were excluded if they were noncurrent smokers or did not wish to be referred to the program. The program consists of entirely remote cessation services provided by a certified tobacco cessation specialist that was free of charge to the patient.</p><p>After the referral was placed by the care team, the tobacco treatment specialist proactivity reached out to the patient and scheduled an initial assessment. The assessment included details about their current smoking status as well as questions about their smoking history. They were educated on the benefits of cessation medication and screened for any contraindications that they may have. A clinical message was sent to their referring provider with pharmacotherapy details and patients retrieved their medication through their pharmacy. They were provided with the option to choose cessation counseling with the Georgia Tobacco Quit Line or through the program's Smoke Free Text Messaging resource. The assessment concluded with creating a personalized quit plan that was reviewed with the patient during follow&#8208;up calls (Figure&#160;<xref rid="cam45423-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We sought to investigate if there were any associations between specific patient characteristics and the likelihood of referral acceptance. After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, 194 patients referred to the program between July 2019 and August 2021 were retrospectively identified. There were more smokers identified, but they were not interested in a referral and are not included in this analysis.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="cam45423-fig-0002" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Once a patient was referred to the tobacco cessation program, a certified tobacco cessation specialist contacted patients remotely free of charge and provided behavioral counseling sessional and motivation interviewing, as well as screened for pharmacotherapy and made referrals to the Georgia tobacco quitline.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-5" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="CAM4-12-7339-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>Demographic data were captured for all these patients, including age, gender, race, education level, religious affiliation, marital status, and the median income of their documented ZIP code, as well as their insurance type and any documented mental health diagnoses. Rates of tobacco cessation were determined by our tobacco cessation specialist and her interactions with the patient, and these rates were captured in the chart reviews. Of note, tobacco cessation was not confirmed with biochemical verification.</p><p>First, a univariate logistic regression was performed with acceptance to the referral program as the event of interest. We used the term &#8220;univariate&#8221; association to describe the association of each independent variable with the outcome (dependent variable) to distinguish it from multivariable analysis in which two or more independent variables are assessed in relation to a dependent outcome. In this context, the term univariate appropriately replaces the term &#8220;bivariate.&#8221; Then, a multivariable analysis was performed using the backward elimination approach to identify factors associated with referral acceptance. Education level and religious affiliation were excluded from multivariable analyses given a large amount of missing data.</p><p>Association of those on cessation program and cessation of tobacco use was performed using Pearson's chi&#8208;square test. Out of the 194 participants, only 8 self&#8208;referred. Given the small number, any analyses evaluating the association of self&#8208;referral with tobacco cessation success would be underpowered, so none were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and statistical significance was assessed at the 0.05 level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="cam45423-sec-0007"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>From July 2019 to August 2021, 194 patients were referred for tobacco cessation services by their oncology care teams.

Engagement of patients with the program (47%) was higher than reports from other NCI&#8208;designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (17% and 6.4%).<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, <xref rid="cam45423-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> However, the referral process was initiated by the cancer care team provider (or a minority of patients who self&#8208;referred), whereas other programs automatically referred a patient if tobacco use was documented in the electronic medical record, which precludes potential smokers from not being properly identified and referred by the provider. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the engagement rates are higher in our cohort.</p><p>We found unmarried and Caucasian patients were less likely to engage with cessation services. In an analysis of a cohort of cancer patients referred to a tobacco cessation program from another NCI&#8208;designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, patients in a relationship and racial minorities were less likely to currently use tobacco. However, they found no correlation between race or relationship status with engagement with cessation services as we did.<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> They did find males were less likely to accept a referral, though we did not find a correlation between gender and referral acceptance.</p><p>A report by the CDC on smoking rates by adults in the United States in 2019 found that the prevalence of current tobacco use was higher for males, single/divorced/widowed patients, and Caucasian patients compared with their counterparts.<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> Perhaps, these subgroups may have greater exposure to tobacco products and increased nicotine dependence that drives the lower rate of referral acceptance among these groups. On univariate logistic regression, there was no association between referral acceptance and having a history of a mental health diagnosis. While mental health is certainly an important and intertwined issue in tobacco use, it did not clearly have an impact on a patient's likelihood to engage with the program in our cohort.</p><p>The tobacco cessation rate of 25.8% among patients that engaged with cessation services is comparable to other NCI&#8208;designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (15%&#8211;47%).<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> Studies have shown certain subgroups of cancer patients have higher rates of tobacco cessation, such as lung cancer patients.<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> In our cohort, 40% of patients were lung cancer patients. However, we did not find an association with lung cancer, though the sample size may not have been sufficiently powered to detect this. While the reviewer suggests lung cancer patients are harder to engage in cessation efforts, data indicate cancer patients with diagnoses related to tobacco use are more likely to quit using tobacco products after diagnosis.</p><p>In our cohort, 90% of patients that engaged with cessation services were initiated on pharmacotherapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends a combination of behavioral therapy with pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation.<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> However, not all providers may feel equipped to counsel patients on tobacco cessation and the various treatment modalities available. A survey of over 1500 cancer providers found that while 90% of providers inquired if patients used tobacco products, only 40% discussed pharmacotherapy options.<xref rid="cam45423-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref> Given the effect of tobacco cessation on oncologic outcomes, it is imperative that patients who smoke are offered pharmacotherapy options.</p><p>Tobacco cessation is especially critical for cancer patients as continued tobacco use is associated with inferior oncologic outcomes and worse quality of life as well as increased risk of additional malignancies. Active engagement of cancer patients with tobacco cessation programs remains challenging. We found that only 48% of referred patients engaged with cessation services at our NCI&#8208;designated Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p><p>For those patients that did engage with cessation services, the tobacco cessation rate was dramatically higher (25.8%) compared to the cessation rate of patients who did not engage (6.9%). We feel the convenience of a remote tobacco cessation specialist was a key part of the success. Many patients travel from rural areas and would be deterred by an additional drive to the city for a tobacco cessation consultation. The ability of tobacco specialists to facilitate pharmacotherapy initiation and refer patients to the Georgia quitline, which offers nicotine replacement at no cost, was also instrumental to the success of the program. Most patients that engaged with cessation services were initiated on pharmacotherapy (90%), underpinning the importance of pharmacotherapy in a successful tobacco cessation program. Unfortunately, studies have shown that many providers feel ill&#8208;equipped to assist with tobacco cessation and initiation of pharmacotherapy, underscoring the importance of tobacco cessation programs that can counsel and prescribe pharmacotherapy.</p><p>Despite the success of the program, we recognize the limitations of our study. As previously indicated, tobacco cessation was not confirmed with biochemical verification. The tobacco cessation specialist documented if tobacco cessation was reported by the patient, which was captured in the chart reviews. Given the geographic spread of patients seen at our cancer center, many patients come from far away, and testing would be burdensome. There may be a slight discrepancy between the reported and actual tobacco cessation rates.</p><p>We further acknowledge that the missing data are a limitation. Demographic information, such as education level, religion, etc. is self&#8208;reported by patients, and completion is not compulsory for office visits. While our sample size was not as large as a multi&#8208;institutional study could have provided, it was large enough to identify an association between program engagement and the relationship status and race of patients. We did not evaluate if there was an association between the cancer stage or the intent of therapy (curative vs. palliative), which could potentially influence the motivation and willingness of a patient to engage with the program, though the analysis would have been limited given the sample size.</p><p>However, our study has its unique strengths. Although other cancer centers have published their experience with tobacco cessation programs, our experience is unique given the demographic spread of the participants. Often underrepresented in clinical trials, African Americans made up 38.7% of participants referred to the program. In comparison, only 18.3% of participants were African American in a tobacco cessation program at an NCI&#8208;designated cancer center in Buffalo, NY, and only 6.08% of participants were African American at an NCI&#8208;designated cancer center in Louisville, KY. We were able to identify that Caucasians were less likely to engage in the program compared with their non&#8208;Caucasian counterparts, which is a finding that was only possible given the sizable amount of non&#8208;Caucasian participants.</p><p>It is critical to develop novel interventions to increase the engagement of patients with tobacco cessation programs, especially unmarried and Caucasian populations as they were less likely to accept a referral to our tobacco cessation program. Cancer patients face distinct challenges in their tobacco cessation journey, such as feelings of being overwhelmed, and may not be properly counseled on the benefits of tobacco cessation on their oncologic outcomes and quality of life. Cancer providers are in a unique position to offer counseling and initiate pharmacotherapy at the time of a cancer diagnosis, during which there is often a high motivation to quit using tobacco products.</p><p>Tobacco cessation should not be neglected in cancer treatment but instead should be seen as important as other treatment modalities given the impact on survival and the quality of life. Our experience further adds to the body of literature that clearly illustrates the importance of tobacco cessation services and the need for innovation to generate novel ways to increase program engagement of populations that were identified as being less likely to engage. Better targeting and enrolling these patients is impactful as the rates of cessation services were dramatically higher in those that engaged in tobacco cessation services (25.8%) compared to those that did not (6.9%) in our cohort.</p></sec><sec id="cam45423-sec-0013"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>
