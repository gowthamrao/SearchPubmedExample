The knowledge and attitudes about these risk factors impact this practice, particularly in communities that follow local traditions. The aim of this study was to determine the level of knowledge and attitude regarding risk factors for oral cancer on Flores Island, East Indonesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was an analytical observational study with a cross-sectional design using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Structured questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the community, local government, and dentists to obtain data; quantitative analysis was performed using regression; and qualitative analysis was performed using themes.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Of 542 participants (men 66.42 %; women 33.57 %), 64.4% had a high level of knowledge and a low level of attitude for S = 62.5%, A = 66.7%, and BQC = 50.0%. There was a correlation between knowledge and attitudes about S (<italic toggle="yes">P =</italic> 0.009) and BQC (<italic toggle="yes">P =</italic> 0.011). The FGDs yielded 14 subjects (five men and nine women) with three themes of knowledge (betel nut ingredients, causes of cancer, and impacts of habits) and three themes of attitude (type of habit, desire to stop, and oral cancer prevention programs). On the basis of FGDs, most of the subjects already knew the causes of oral cancer, but the desire to stop and prevent oral cancer was difficult.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The population on Flores Island has a high level of knowledge but a low level of attitude.

Oral cancer is one of the many causes of oral and dental health issues and can involve the lips, oral cavity, and pharynx.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The American Cancer Society&#8217;s most recent estimates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers in the United States for 2023 indicate approximately 54,540 new cases and 11,580 deaths. The cause of oral cancer is multifactorial, but the established risks are smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing (BQC).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] According to Petti, tobacco use&#8212;smoking and/or chewing&#8212;causes 25% of oral cancers, alcohol use causes 7%&#8211;19% of oral cancers, poor nutrition causes 10%&#8211;15% of oral cancers, and more than 50% oral cancers are detected in areas where areca nut chewing is common.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In Indonesia, research on oral cancer risk factors is scarce, restricted to academic institutions, and not multicenter. According to the 2018 Indonesian National Health Survey, the prevalence of alcohol use and smoking was 3.3% and 28.8%, respectively. In 2015, a preliminary study conducted in Bajawa, East Nusa Tenggara, indicated that 15 of 192 patients had premalignant lesions. All 15 individuals had the habit of chewing betel nuts (100%), whereas 86.6% (13 subjects) enjoyed drinking traditional alcohol and 13.3% (two subjects) enjoyed smoking kretek.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A study by Sari <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that the prevalence of betel quid chewers within five provinces in Indonesia was 12.6% and significantly associated with the oral potentially malignant disorder (<italic toggle="yes">P &lt;</italic> 0.01).</p><p>One of the components that affect the establishment of attitudes is knowledge.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Since no study has addressed risk factors for oral cancer in East Indonesia, this study attempts to identify the elements that contribute to oral cancer risk-related knowledge and attitudes.

Using questionnaires pertaining to knowledge (12 items) and attitudes (28 items) about oral cancer risk factors, a quantitative data set was constructed. The data set was confirmed using the Rasch model.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] For the knowledge questionnaire, the Guttman scale was utilized, while the Likert scale was utilized for the attitude questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were analyzed by the Rasch model, which showed a Cronbach &#945; of 0.85, an item reliability of 0.87 with a separation of 2.59, and a unidimensional eigenvalue of 5.57.</p><p>The consecutive sampling of the quantitative study was carried out on the participants who visited dental clinics in all (total of eight) districts in Flores Island and provided signed informed consent to participate in this study (13 July&#8211;20 August 2022). The presence of nonparticipants in the quantitative study was attributed to the dentist, who selected respondents and collected respondents&#8217; questionnaires. The inclusion criteria for subjects were still having the habit of smoking, consuming alcohol, and chewing betel nuts. The exclusion criteria for participants were having abstained from oral cancer-risk habits for at least three years. Each participant was required to complete an informed consent form.</p><p>To obtain patients with oral cancer risk habits, dentists from eight cities on the island of Flores underwent questionnaire calibration and subject recruitment.

The samples of the qualitative study are participants who visited the public hospital and primary health care facilities in Bajawa. The inclusion criteria for participants were age &gt;18 and ongoing use of betel nuts, alcohol drinking, or smoking. Subjects who have quit smoking, drinking alcohol, or chewing betel nuts within the past year are excluded. One researcher conducted interviews or focus group discussions (FGDs) using questions that had been developed beforehand.</p><p>A qualitative study was conducted employing five to eight questions prepared in conjunction with the quantitative study&#8217;s theme before the study commenced. The participants, consisting of five individuals, six dentists, and three local government officials, were recruited using a purposive sampling method. Before the interview, participants were required to provide informed consent. The 15- to 30-min interviews were performed face to face, and the audio was recorded by phone and then properly transcribed for subsequent investigation by a blind investigator. There were no repeated interviews conducted in this study. The field notes and general comments from participants were documented. The transcripts were not returned to the participants for any feedback to avoid bias in the answers post-interview. The questions of the conceptual framework of knowledge (oral cancer etiology, ingredients of BQC, and impact of risk habits) and attitudes (willingness to stop and effort to prevent mouth cancer) of oral cancer risk factors were provided, and used to produce categorical codes, without conducting pilot testing. The application of a broad inductive thematic analysis to the data led to the establishment of themes. The primary topics and subthemes were finalized, and codes were assigned to meaningful data. A single coder was responsible for the data coding. Then, from these codes, themes were created, which reflected information that appeared to establish a profile of knowledge and attitudes toward oral cancer risk factors. Subsequently, themes were reanalyzed and confirmed. The saturation was fulfilled by the consistency of the responses from respondents. A minimal 60% of similar responses regarding the knowledge and attitudes about risk factors for oral cancer were considered theme saturation. Conformability attempts were made to validate results by comparing responses to the point of saturation and cross-examining the data. All data were analyzed by the Nvivo 12 program (Lumivero, Denver, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><sec><title>Q<sc>UANTITATIVE STUDY</sc></title><p>Based on inclusion criteria, of the 648 subjects recruited, 106 were excluded due to the exclusion criteria or incomplete data.

Oral cancer risk habits are more frequent when socializing with friends. The intention to quit smoking, drinking alcohol, and chewing betel nuts already exists, but it is difficult to achieve (quotes #2 and #3) due to factors surrounding friendships and substance addiction. Environmental factors that pay less attention to oral health (quote #4) should also be highlighted regarding the population&#8217;s attitudes toward oral cancer risk habits. This issue is further complicated by the existence of traditions and culture (quotes #7 and #9), particularly with the habit of chewing betel nuts, which tends to remain a family tradition (attitudes questionnaire and quote #1). Indeed, the local government and local dentists should play an active role in efforts to prevent oral cancer by informing individuals about oral cancer risk factors (quotes #5, #6, and #7) either directly or through the development of posters (quote #8). However, it is also necessary to formulate regulations for the control of products and materials that pose a risk of oral cancer (quote #10) to ensure the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at preventing oral cancer.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="JISPCD_20_23-t003" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Participants&#8217; responses about oral cancer risk habits</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ID participant</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quotes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">General population <break/>#3</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In our locality, the main ingredients for betel quid are areca nut, limestone chalk, and betel leaf, although betel leaf is predominantly used.

The correlation model revealed strong influences among variables and the sociocultural influence on the population&#8217;s attitude toward oral cancer risk habits. The government, healthcare professionals, and public figures should collaborate to overcome sociocultural barriers.</p><sec sec-type="funding-statement"><title>F<sc>INANCIAL SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP</sc></title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>C<sc>ONFLICTS OF INTEREST</sc></title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>A<sc>UTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</sc></title><p>The interviewers were RA and IG. RA is a female researcher (32 years old) and senior lecturer, as well as a professor in oral medicine. IG is a male researcher (23 years old) and senior lecturer with a PhD in oral medicine. Both RA and IG work at Universitas Trisakti. No relationships between the researcher and the study participants were established before the study&#8217;s commencement. Participants were only notified about the purpose of the study. Both of the interviewers were from the same department, had an interest in the same research topic, and designed and validated the structured questionnaire for this study. The bias and unmatched assumptions that could arise from the interviews with the participants were eliminated by jointly discussing the recorded interviews. FAN was responsible for writing the draft of the manuscript and coding qualitative data. IG and FKH performed the statistical analysis and transcription recording. EFS reviewed the manuscript. All authors have confirmed all presented data and read the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>E<sc>THICAL POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD STATEMENT</sc></title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Commission, Faculty of Dentistry, Universitas Trisakti (022/S3/KEPK/FKG/7/2022).</p></sec><sec><title>P<sc>ATIENT DECLARATION OF CONSENT</sc></title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>D<sc>ATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT</sc></title><p>The data for our study is subject to legal regulations in Indonesia.
