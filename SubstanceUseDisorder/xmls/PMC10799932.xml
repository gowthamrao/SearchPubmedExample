However, many intoxication patients presenting to the ED, may not be identified retrospectively if only a single search method is applied. In this study, a new four-way combined patient search method was used to retrospectively identify intoxication patients presenting to the ED. The search included reason for admission to the ED, laboratory results related to intoxication diagnostics, ICD-10 codes, and a novel free word search (FWS) of patient records. After the automated search, the researcher read the medical records of potential substance abuse patients to form comprehensive profiles and remove irrelevant cases. The addition of a free word search identified 36% more substance abuse patients than the combination of the other three methods mentioned above. Patients identified by the FWS search alone were generally admitted to the ED for trauma or mental health problems and were often found to be heavily under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. The main intoxicants were ethanol and benzodiazepines. The free word search was highly complementary to traditional patient search methods, highlighting the importance of the combined patient search method in retrospective data collection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Data acquisition</kwd><kwd>Databases</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd><kwd>Addiction</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Finnish Cultural Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hauho Savings Bank Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Renko Savings Bank Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Social Affairs, Finland</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Acute poisonings, both accidental and deliberate, pose a significant strain on emergency departments (EDs) around the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to a recent estimate, over 96 million or 29% of people aged 15&#8211;64 living in the European Union have experimented with illegal substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. While availability and fashion shape the illegal drug market, burdensome times, like war or the Covid-19 era, create anxiety. The latter can be seen e.g. in mentally unstable persons&#8217; attendance at the ED due to intoxication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The consensus is that intoxication cases due to both legal substances, such as ethanol, and illegal substances are on the rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Intoxicated patients arriving at the ED are often in a critical condition and short-term mortality is high after acute poisoning due to substance abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. When the patient may not be able to provide enough information or, in the case of illicit substances, may not want to, accurate diagnosis for proper treatment is difficult. Therefore, it is essential to keep track of the constant change in the healthcare setting, while not forgetting cultural differences. In Europe, ethanol is the leading cause of attending the ED due to intoxication for an intoxication visit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, whereas in Saudi Arabia ethanol related cases are virtually unknown, the most commonly abused substance being paracetamol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Pesticide poisonings, such as organophosphate, are more common in developing countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The range of substances available is also diverse, as drug content often varies from shipment to shipment and new drugs, such as novel psychoactive substances (NPS), appear in rapid speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Only a small number of studies on the flow of poisoning patients in ED have been carried out in Europe during the last two decades.

In this study, our primary aim is to create a precise method for retrospective intoxication data search. We present our four-way combined patient search method and its performance.

Psychiatric EHR was accessed if mental health was a contributor to the intoxication visit.

However, since all these patients had a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse and often several hours had passed from usage by the time the patients arrived to the ED, we considered their results to be potentially significant.

The EHR system enabled broad, retrospective data collection. The use of the four methods was estimated to gather information on all intoxication patients as completely as possible. For example, if the clinician had treated trauma as a result of intoxication, a single specification like an ICD-10 code or reason for attending related to intoxication may have been missed. In such cases, our combined four-way search was more powerful than the use of a single specification like ICD-10 code.</p><p id="Par42">We chose to gather our retrospective data from 2019. Since all the intoxication visits studied took place prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Europe, the pandemic did not influence our results. For the pilot analysis, we included data on the patients born on the first four days of each month. The strength is that the patient data were presumably not skewed in any sense.</p><p id="Par43">After the combined four-way search, our pilot analysis of intoxications included less than two hundred cases, which could be considered a limitation. The material was collected retrospectively, which may have caused some data to be missed. For example, notation differences or misspellings may have affected data obtained from the EHR.</p><p id="Par44">Laboratory results also have their limitations and may lead to misdiagnosis. Cross-reactivity is very common with amphetamines, e.g. with bupropion or ranitidine. In these cases medical records were often helpful, but there are also substances that were not detected by traditional laboratory methods like gamma-hydroxybutyrate or gamma-butyrolactone, and can only be found based on clinical suspicion and history.</p><p id="Par45">Another limitation of our research is our definition of alcohol intoxication. Differences in individual alcohol tolerance have a significant impact on the symptoms of alcohol use. Sometimes a patient may also present to the ED with significant symptoms hours after consuming alcohol, but the alcohol level at this point will only be less than one per mille. Hence, the distinction between poisoning and moderate intoxication is sometimes unclear. Because our patients required monitoring and treatment in the ED, the terminology may not be relevant to patient flow.</p><p id="Par46">As this was a single centre study, the results may not be widely generalizable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">A novel four-way combined patient search method revealed more intoxication patients than a traditional retrospective search. A free word search in the EHR system of the hospital revealed over one third more patients than the combined search of reason for attending, laboratory findings, and ICD-10 codes. In the analysis of our pilot patient population, ethanol was the main substance ingested and causing intoxication. Misuse of prescription drugs was a notable problem, which should be better analysed later. With our modern data abstraction method, we hope to achieve a comprehensive picture of acute intoxication patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
