In 2020, drug overdoses increased nearly 30% relative to 2019, with opioids contributing to the majority of such events.<xref rid="pnad072-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In 2019, 10.1 million people misused prescription opioids, with 1.6 million misusing for the first time.<xref rid="pnad072-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Evidence suggests that those who misuse prescription opioids go on to misuse other drugs, including heroin and fentanyl, leading to even greater risks of overdose.<xref rid="pnad072-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnad072-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Additionally, those with opioid use disorder have lower reported quality of life and increased risk of comorbidities, including infection, respiratory and cardiac disease, and poor mental health.<xref rid="pnad072-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The cost burden associated with the treatment of patients with opioid use disorder was more than $5 billion in 2015 dollars, according to an analysis from the Council of Economic Advisors.<xref rid="pnad072-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The cost of fatal overdoses attributed to opioids and opioid use disorder has since increased to $1.02 trillion, according to 2017 data.<xref rid="pnad072-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The health care system is often seen as the source of misused opioids, either through patients becoming long-term users after treatment for pain or through diversion of opioids outside of official legal channels.<xref rid="pnad072-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Nevertheless, opioids are mainstay drugs for postoperative pain, and insufficient pain management puts patients at risk for the development of chronic pain, which is much more refractory to treatment.<xref rid="pnad072-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This duality puts health care providers in the bind of needing to prescribe sufficient opioids for pain relief, but not so many that patients progress to long-term use or that the drugs can be easily diverted.</p><p>The United States (US) Military Health System (MHS) is highly concerned with opioid use among its beneficiaries. Although illicit drug use is lower in the military than in the civilian population, prescription drug abuse is increasingly prevalent among military members.<xref rid="pnad072-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> This is a dual concern because of the prevalence of chronic pain, often treated with opioids, among military members, along with the side effects of opioids and ongoing chronic pain that significantly impair military readiness.<xref rid="pnad072-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10&#8211;13</sup></xref> The MHS also treats civilian beneficiaries, including retirees and dependents of military members, who are not directly subject to readiness issues but have the same risks as the general population and pose the same burden to the health care system if they progress to long-term, or inappropriate, opioid use. In recognition of this, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) specifically charges the MHS with greater oversight of opioid prescription and use. It is important to note that MHS beneficiaries may receive their care at either military or civilian facilities, making this oversight relevant to civilian health care facilities as well.</p><p>The Comparative Effectiveness and Provider-Induced Demand Collaboration (EPIC) Project, a joint military&#8211;civilian research initiative, has been studying the use of opioids in the MHS since 2016. Peer-reviewed, accepted articles have presented findings on multiple opioid-relevant topics, including prescribing practices; use in special populations, such as children and injured combat veterans; and risk factors for long-term use. The present work is a framework analysis of the relevant publications that resulted from the EPIC Project, and it provides insight into the major themes and findings. The holistic contextualization we provide here is expected to inform discussion among stakeholders and policymakers seeking guidance on appropriate use of opioids in the MHS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Framework synthesis was chosen as the appropriate method for synthesizing the quantitative research with the aim of understanding opioid use in the MHS. Methodologically, framework analysis is flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of new material while retaining enough rigor to permit firm conclusions. Framework analysis uses an approach similar to that of systematic reviews and is a highly structured pragmatic methodology for research synthesis.<xref rid="pnad072-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Compared with a formal systematic review, a framework synthesis is faster and more flexible to conduct.

This project conducts health services research by focusing on core areas of health and readiness, pediatrics, policy, surgery, trauma, and women&#8217;s health and using the MHS Data Repository, which is the electronic health record for the MHS. The EPIC Project hosts a segment of the MHS Data Repository from 2005&#8211;2021 that includes TRICARE claims data from approximately 9.6 million military members, dependents, and retirees. These data are composed of care delivered in military facilities (direct care) and care delivered in the civilian sector (private sector care). Most beneficiaries are non&#8211;active-duty, and the population has been shown to be broadly representative of the national demographics for ages 18&#8211;64 years.<xref rid="pnad072-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17&#8211;19</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction and synthesis</title><p>EPIC annual and quarterly reports were used to identify 106 published, peer-reviewed articles. Articles selected for inclusion in this framework synthesis were those that directly assessed opioid prescribing or use within the MHS as a primary or secondary objective. Articles that did not meet these criteria were excluded. Two reviewers (J.K.-B. and M.L.J.) independently applied the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool<xref rid="pnad072-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> to all included studies. These 2 reviewers had no involvement in the publication of included articles. Another reviewer (T.P.K.) settled disputes between the 2 initial reviewers. Critical appraisal is a hallmark of systematic review and is aimed at ensuring methodological rigor and minimizing bias.</p><p>The final pool was subjected to framework analysis. A priori, the following factors were selected for abstraction: the years of health care data considered in the constituent works, year of publication, question(s) addressed by the article, sample characteristics, methods of statistical analyses, and results. These factors were then abstracted from each study that met the inclusion criteria into a framework or matrix. We then analyzed studies across the framework for specific patterns of opioid use and prescribing within the MHS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study characteristics and themes</title><p>Of the 106 candidate articles, 17 met inclusion criteria.

First, opioid prescribing practices are overall appropriate and well correlated with the degree of injury or intensity of surgical intervention. Investigation into patient refill practices shows that approximately 19% of patients seek opioid refills after common surgical procedures, with a median optimum length of 4&#8211;7&#8201;days. In certain instances, such as some women&#8217;s health and musculoskeletal procedures, the optimal initial prescription length could be as long as 14&#8211;15&#8201;days after discharge.<xref rid="pnad072-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In the case of hemorrhoidectomy, optimal length was found to be 5&#8211;10&#8201;days.<xref rid="pnad072-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> For pediatric patients, the prescription of opioids was linked to increased emergency department visits for both pain and constipation.<xref rid="pnad072-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Prescription of opioids at discharge in trauma patients was more common in those who were older or married and less common in males or those with a history of anxiety.<xref rid="pnad072-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>Findings relative to low back pain indicate that civilian and contract providers are more likely than military providers to prescribe opioids. However, nurse practitioners, residents, and physician assistants were less likely than physicians overall to prescribe opioids for low back pain.<xref rid="pnad072-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Among postpartum women, patients delivering in civilian health care were more likely to fill an opioid prescription than were those in military facilities. Additionally, women with cesarean deliveries were more likely to fill an opioid prescription than were those without a cesarean delivery.<xref rid="pnad072-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>Overall, trauma and surgery were not found to be substantive drivers of sustained opioid use in previously opioid-na&#239;ve patients. At 1&#160;year after major trauma, less than 1% of individuals in this class were still receiving prescriptions for opioids, and patients of younger age and Black race were more likely to discontinue opioids, as well.<xref rid="pnad072-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> At 6&#8201;months after spinal surgery, only 0.1% of previously opioid-na&#239;ve patients were still receiving opioid prescriptions.<xref rid="pnad072-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> In both studies, opioid use was correlated to the severity of injury and intensity of the surgical procedure.

Specifically, trauma and surgery were not found to be substantive drivers of sustained opioid use in previously opioid-na&#239;ve patients; substantial racial disparities were noted in multiple studies; and initial non-trauma diagnoses for which opioids were not the standard of care appear to be driving much of the long-term opioid use, and this has resulted in poor care and excessive health care cost.</p><p>Although many studies address the receipt of opioid prescriptions and various aspects of use within specific cohorts or health systems, the present analysis is useful for its synthesis of research across a range of topics and within a demographic that has been shown to be representative of the US population at greatest risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of opioid exposure. This enables linkages between studies, such as the intersection between improper prescription of opioids and delays in appropriate care (eg, delaying access to DMARDs), as well as the risk of sustained use. Another linkage occurs between the finding of low back pain as a driver of inappropriate opioid prescribing and determinations about the proclivity of civilian or contract providers to be aggressive providers of opioids for low back pain. Similarly, providers in civilian health care more commonly prescribe opioids for postpartum women than do providers in military facilities. Taken together, this suggests that better training of providers, particularly in the private sector setting, can help to lower the risk of sustained prescription opioid use in the MHS. Additionally, the definition of &#8220;prior sustained use,&#8221; initially described by Schoenfeld et al.<xref rid="pnad072-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> in an investigation focused on spine surgery in the MHS, was found to have high external validity and reproducibility in separate confirmatory studies and was subsequently advocated as a standardized means of measuring chronic opioid use.<xref rid="pnad072-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p><p>As described previously, the findings that less than 1% of opioid-na&#239;ve patients progress to long-term use, that only 19% seek a refill after their initial postsurgical prescription, that children and adolescents prescribed opioids have less than 2 days&#8217; excess medication, and that opioid prescriptions correlate closely with severity of injury or intensity of surgical intervention suggest that prescribing practices in the MHS are appropriate, overall. However, several individual findings stand out.</p><p>Prior opioid exposure was found to be a strong predictor of sustained use in the majority of studies. Specifically, the bedside risk assessment tool for sustained prescription opioid use after surgery developed by Chaudhary et al. found prior opioid exposure to be the factor most strongly linked to sustained use.<xref rid="pnad072-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Given that long-term use can be costly for the MHS and that alternative pain treatment strategies, including multimodal approaches, have been found to have fewer adverse outcomes as service members transition to the Veterans Health Administration, such approaches warrant further attention.<xref rid="pnad072-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Alternatively, some studies have suggested restricting opioid prescriptions in higher-risk patients to only the immediate time frame after a procedure.<xref rid="pnad072-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Similarly, depression was found to be associated with sustained prescription opioid use after spine surgery, orthopedic trauma, rib fractures, general surgery, and joint arthroplasty. This finding is in agreement with literature from populations outside of the MHS and suggests that a full patient history should be taken into consideration before the issue of any opioids.<xref rid="pnad072-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40&#8211;42</sup></xref></p><p>Prior literature had indicated that racial disparities do exist in the issue of and sustained use of prescription opioids.<xref rid="pnad072-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Although racial disparities were not the main focus of the present synthesis, the included studies showed that White, Black, and Asian patients are more likely than other races to be prescribed opioids after traumatic injury. However, Black patients were less likely than White patients to become sustained opioid users after surgery or trauma. <xref rid="pnad072-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnad072-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="pnad072-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Among postpartum women, women of Asian and Other race were less likely to fill an opioid prescription after discharge than were White women.<xref rid="pnad072-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> More research needs to be conducted to determine the underlying etiologies behind these disparities and further means of mitigation.</p><p>Despite the strengths of this analysis, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, as the included studies were conducted with secondary data analysis, their findings are subject to coding errors entered at the clinical stage, and clinically granular findings are not available to inform the studies. Second, the included studies focused mainly on practices surrounding opioid prescription and use rather than on measurable treatment outcomes. The exceptions were the findings of opioids delaying access to DMARDs and the association of preoperative use with longer or more intensive hospital stays. It is also worth noting that secondary analysis cannot assess &#8220;cure&#8221; rates, as recovery from opioid use disorder is not a coded outcome. Third, there do appear to be practice-based differences between the military and civilian health systems, such that all findings might not be equally generalizable to all health care contexts. However, the association of long-term use with diagnoses for which opioids are not standard of care, the delayed access to DMARDs for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the lack of postoperative complications with preoperative opioid usage, and the implementation of a risk score for predicting long-term use are likely relevant to health care settings outside of the MHS.</p><p>Opioid prescribing practices in the MHS are generally appropriate and are not a significant driver of sustained use. Contributing factors to sustained prescription opioid use include prior opioid exposure and prescription of opioids for low back pain, mental health, and nonspecific conditions for which opioid medications are not the standard of care. A tool to predict the risk of sustained prescription opioid use has been developed, and it might assist providers in determining appropriate strategies for pain management after surgery or traumatic injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>pnad072_Supplementary_Data</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pnad072_supplementary_data.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
