We enrolled a total of 27,401 radiology free-text reports of X-ray examinations of the spine. The predictive effects were compared between text mining models built using supervised long short-term memory networks, independently derived by four sampling methods: vector sum minimization, vector sum maximization, stratified, and simple random sampling, using four fixed percentages. The drawn samples were applied to the training set, and the remaining samples were used to validate each group using different sampling methods and ratios. The predictive accuracy was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) to identify VCF. At the sampling ratios of 1/10, 1/20, 1/30, and 1/40, the highest AUROC was revealed in the sampling methods of vector sum minimization as confidence intervals of 0.981 (95%CIs: 0.980&#8211;0.983)/0.963 (95%CIs: 0.961&#8211;0.965)/0.907 (95%CIs: 0.904&#8211;0.911)/0.895 (95%CIs: 0.891&#8211;0.899), respectively. The lowest AUROC was demonstrated in the vector sum maximization. This study proposes an advanced sampling method, vector sum minimization, in free-text data that can be efficiently applied to build the text mining models by smartly drawing a small amount of critical representative samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sampling method</kwd><kwd>free-text data</kwd><kwd>vector sum</kwd><kwd>vertebral fracture</kwd><kwd>radiology report</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>E-Da Hospital</funding-source><award-id>EDAHP108013</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study is supported by research project of E-Da Hospital, Taiwan (grant number: EDAHP108013).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In medical practice, there are many types of data, including numeric, categorical, or textual, and the numeric and categorical data can be processed directly in statistical analysis and have various clinical applications in patient care [<xref rid="B1-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Textual data such as radiology free-text reports were commonly recorded by physicians from free typing with possibly high variability in the data between different physicians. It was necessary to manually review each report to further utilize the data; in addition, this process is inefficient and complex, with potentially high error rates [<xref rid="B2-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that makes a computer understand, analyze, and interpret human language through machine learning and could be a solution for extracting critical information from free-text data. NLP is widely applied in many systems including search engines, voice assistance, translation software, and chatbots [<xref rid="B4-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We can extract vital information from free-form text, known as unstructured data, by NLP, and this process is called data mining, also known as semantics in machine learning [<xref rid="B5-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Building the semantic text mining model through the NLP technology seemed to be an alternative way for applying free-text data in medicine [<xref rid="B6-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a common disease in the aging population, significantly impacting quality of life and associated with higher mortality [<xref rid="B8-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The prevalence of VCF is around 10&#8211;20% in 50-year-old women and increases to 30&#8211;50% in 90-year-olds worldwide [<xref rid="B10-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Not only in postmenopausal women, VCF is also a vital health issue for older men [<xref rid="B11-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Prior osteoporotic VCF is correlated with five times greater risk of subsequent VCF within a year and other osteoporotic fractures including hip fractures [<xref rid="B12-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The identification and management of VCF is crucial for reducing morbidity due to refracture, disability or chronic pain, and mortality [<xref rid="B13-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Capture the Fracture (CTF)<sup>&#174;</sup>, projected by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF), is a program to implement case management models, known as fracture liaison services (FLS), with 13 standards to prevent secondary fractures [<xref rid="B14-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Standard 4 of CTF<sup>&#174;</sup> is to identify the patients who are reported by the radiologists to have VCF on medical imaging exams and deliver further evaluation and treatment for them [<xref rid="B14-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most of the reports for medical imaging exams by radiologists are in the free-text form, and identifying patients with VCF from the reports is needed to be executed by manual reviews from clinical staff. Obviously, these works on VCF require high manpower and are underdiagnosed [<xref rid="B15-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Semantic text mining models could be built to efficiently identify the reports with the semantics of VCF from the radiology free-form text reports of X-rays by supervised machine learning [<xref rid="B16-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The barriers in implementing FLS, including high manpower demand and a high underdiagnosed rate for identifying the patients with VCF [<xref rid="B17-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], can be significantly improved by applying semantic text mining in healthcare institutions. In addition, a supervised machine learning algorithm has been designed to train the machine using well-labeled samples, which were tagged with the correct answers and called the training set [<xref rid="B19-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is important but time-consuming to identify which clinical staff gave the labels, with or without VCF, to some of the radiology text reports and then build the semantic text mining models by supervised machine learning. These newly designed models could be used for identifying VCF from other radiology reports without labels.</p><p>For building the models, manually labeling for the partial data to become the role as the training set was still the critical step before processing machine learning with two important difficulties [<xref rid="B18-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. First, the labeling performed by clinical physicians was also time-consuming owing to recoding [<xref rid="B20-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Next, it was difficult to determine which part of the data should be chosen to be the training set from all the studied data, and this step may have significantly influenced the predictive effect of the following building models. If the training set data was biased, for example, the data did not cover the description of &#8220;biconcave fracture&#8221;, the semantic text mining models for VCF building in this situation could not properly identify the text reports with &#8220;biconcave fracture&#8221; as VCF was detected positive [<xref rid="B1-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B22-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sampling the small amounts of critical representative data to be the training set for building the models was an efficient way; however, there was no credible sampling method in free-text data, different from numerical data that can be sampled by random, stratified, systemic, or cluster methods [<xref rid="B23-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With the reliable sampling process, efficiently building the semantic text mining models for extracting the information with a high accuracy rate from not only radiology reports but also other textual data such as the reports of esophagogastroduodenoscopic, electrocardiographic, and sonographic exams, could be achieved. The aim of this study is to establish the advanced sampling methods in free-text data for efficiently building the semantic text mining models by deep learning while identifying VCF from radiology free-text reports as exemplars.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>2.1. Database</title><p>This study enrolled 30,102 free-text radiological reports for X-rays from experienced radiologists in the database of E-Da Hospital from 1 August 2018 to 31 January 2020. The hospital serves approximately 1,000,000 (outpatients)/40,000 (inpatients) people/year. It is a tertiary referral hospital in southern Taiwan [<xref rid="B24-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The inclusion criteria are X-ray examination of the lateral view of the thoracolumbar or lumbosacral spine, and text reports must be written in English. After excluding text reports with Chinese&#8211;English mixed communication (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 803), and duplicate data (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1898), a total of 27,401 X-ray reports were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>2.2. Labeling of Vertebral Compression Fracture</title><p>After reading the reports, all data were labeled by two experienced clinical physicians for whether a case is VCF positive or not. The labels only determined the semantics in textual reports without reviewing X-ray image data or the consideration of the correctness of the reports from the radiologists. The possibly relevant descriptions for determining VCF included compression fracture, anterior wedging, biconcave fracture, biconcave deformities, crush fracture, decreased vertebral height, insufficiency fracture, osteoporotic vertebral fracture, concave deformity, vertebral collapse, and similar statements. If the labels given by the two clinical physicians are different, the third experienced clinical physician is needed to give labels and discuss with the first two physicians again until the three physicians make the labels consistent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>2.3. Sampling Methods</title><p>We performed data sampling by four methods, including vector sum minimization, vector sum maximization, stratified sampling, and simple random sampling, by an arbitrary fixed percentage, including 1/10, 1/20, 1/30, and 1/40 of the total number of radiology text reports enrolled in this study, to prepare the training set for building semantic text mining models. The method was initially executed using the document to vector technology that proposed the neural network language model to convert each text report into a 400-dimensional vector, where the 400 value was used to represent one report [<xref rid="B25-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar semantic documents had similar vector presentation (e.g., the report of X-ray involved the meaning of &#8220;VCF&#8221; is close to &#8220;vertebroplasty&#8221;). Each radiology text report included in this study was recognized as one sample. Based on the vector of each text report, all samples were clustered by hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), an unsupervised learning algorithm to group subjects based on their similarity like vector presentation, and each group had its own cluster center [<xref rid="B26-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The setting used in HAC that was (1) Euclidean distance, known as straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space [<xref rid="B27-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], was at or less than 35 between the sample in the group and its cluster center, and (2) the window size that was the maximum distance between the focus word and its contextual neighbors was set to 6 (consider six words in front of and behind the word). The vector sum minimization sampling method was to minimize the vector sum of all the drawn samples relative to the cluster center in each group. Contrary to the first method, the second method maximized the vector sum of all the drawn samples relative to the cluster center in each group. The stratified sampling randomly sampled data in each group according to the required ratio. The previous three methods were delivered by drawing samples from each group, clustered by HAC, according to a fixed percentage. The fourth method used simple random sampling without clustering.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>2.4. Machine Learning Methodologies and Statistical Analyses</title><p>The machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses were performed using Python (version 3.7.3; Python, Beaverton, OR, USA) for Windows. The validation and comparison of the effects between the models were carried out using MedCalc (version 19.2.0; MD aware LLC, San Francisco, CA, USA). The first three sampling methods clustered by HAC, the vector sum of all drawn samples relative to the cluster center in each group was calculated and expressed by Euclidean distance shown as mean &#177; standard deviation.

When sampling 1/10 of the total number of radiology text reports as the training set, the remaining 9/10 data, which was not in the training set, was used in the test set. Following this rule, when the percentage 1/20, 1/30, 1/40 was applied as the sampling percentage to become the training set, 19/20, 29/30, 39/40 of the other remaining data were used as the test set, respectively. The effects of the semantic text mining models were presented by area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and the DeLong test was applied to compare the AUROC of two models [<xref rid="B29-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The receiver operating characteristics curve is a graph formed using two parameters, true positive rate and false positive rate, to demonstrate the performance of a classification model at various thresholds settings.

Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that proposed using the sum of the document vector in groups clustered after HAC as a sampling basis for textual data and proved the vector sum minimization as an effective method to draw the little amount of critical samples to build the reliable semantic text mining models, which also became the first models to identify VCF from radiology reports. This study demonstrated that clustering textual data by the document vector was reasonably verified by the stratified sampling method based on the groups divided by HAC, and was shown to be having a better effect than the simple random sampling method for building predictive models. Under the basis of clustering the textual data by document vector, the following step drew samples relying on a vector sum relative to the cluster centers in each group that could be representative, clarified by the vector sum minimization as best and vector sum maximization as the worst method for the predictive effects of their own building models among four sampling methods. Both stratified by document vector and drawn by vector sum minimization were credible sampling methods, whereas the vector sum minimization sampling method was better.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>4.1. The Importance of Text Mining Models</title><p>This study established the reliably semantic text mining models to identify the patients with VCF from the radiology reports of an X-ray. The under-diagnosis of VCF is a worldwide problem and the rates are reported as 34&#8211;50% [<xref rid="B32-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Gehlbach et al. demonstrated that even when VCF was stated in radiology reports, only 17% of the hospitalized patients were mentioned. The diagnosis of VCF in discharging medical records resulted in a high possibility to miss further intervention and treatment [<xref rid="B33-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Majumdar et al. revealed the treatment rate was 25% for osteoporosis of the patients with VCF reported by radiology reports [<xref rid="B34-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The gaps from image exams to perform the treatment were caused by a lack of the awareness in VCF and the ambiguous descriptions in radiology reports [<xref rid="B32-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Before applying the AI models, only 75.6% of the radiology reports of VCF were indicated &#8220;compression fracture&#8221; in this study. The semantic text mining models could detect not only the statement of &#8220;compression fracture&#8221; but also the descriptions with similar semantics as &#8220;compression fracture&#8221;. The identifying rates of VCF from radiology reports using the semantic text mining models built following the vector sum minimization sampling method were 95.1&#8211;98.8%, which indicates better performance as compared to only 64.5% using traditional keyword searching. Furthermore, the models can be helpful to rapidly detect the VCF patients from the radiological reports even decades ago. Therefore, the models can become a powerful AI-assisted system to actively remind the clinicians in identifying and treating the patients with VCF and potentially improving the treatment gap to prevent morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B11-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The technique of text mining was widely used in medicine for free-text data analyzing. The current studies showed the application of text mining in textual data such as electronic medical records to extract valuable information for medical decision support, disease risk prediction, drug reaction detection, personalized healthcare, and classification of diagnosis [<xref rid="B36-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Although text mining is a powerful tool in textual documents, the previous work showed the important step, manual annotations, before building the models. The advanced sampling methods for free-text data shown in this study could be a crucial technique to save the time by manually annotating a small size of partial data and minimizing the barriers of establishing text mining models.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>4.2. The Importance of Sampling Methods in Textual Data</title><p>Manually labeling large amounts of samples to build the models was not efficient [<xref rid="B20-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas sampling methods were the solution drawn for the small-size representative sample [<xref rid="B41-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, there was a lack of studies focused on sampling methods in the textual data and proving the effectiveness in clinical practice. Our study proposed the sampling method based on the document vector and showed the significantly better predictive effect of the models in the stratified sampling setting compared with simple random sampling [<xref rid="B42-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This result revealed that the document vector was the typical character of the textual data [<xref rid="B43-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, the vector sum was calculated by the addition of the vector of each drawn sample relative to the cluster center. We proposed that minimizing the vector sum implied to the evenly distributed samples of their own groups in the vector space were drawn and became representative, whereas the maximization of the vector sum was the opposite setting to draw biased samples. About the comparing the predictive effects of the models among four settings of sampling method, vector sum minimization settings were demonstrated as significantly highest and vector sum maximization settings were the lowest compared with the other settings in any sampling ratios. These results supported that proposed vector sum minimization could be one of the reliable sampling methods in textual data to draw the critical representative samples. Additionally, implementing this concept in sampling image data based on the latent space could provide a viable approach [<xref rid="B44-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In constructing predictive or classification models for images, manually labeling large amounts of data is inefficient. Drawing a small but representative subset of data is crucial and an efficient means to establish models through deep learning. Further investigation into developing a sampling method for image data based on the idea of vector sum minimization could be explored.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>4.3. Implementation of Vector Sum Minimization</title><p>When applying sampling methods of vector sum minimization, all the possible permutations and combinations of the needed drawn samples in their groups were completed and then the samples&#8217; combination with vector sum minimization was chosen. The document was converted into a 400-dimensional vector, a similar concept as 400 variables in each data, and there were around 600 data of each group in average. There were many possible permutations and combinations, and calculations combined with comparing the high dimensional vector sum in each dimension were complex missions. The time complexity estimated the amount of time taken by running an algorithm and should be considered for applying the sampling methods using a vector sum [<xref rid="B45-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For the large database of textual documents with a higher dimensional vector, the time complexity was also higher resulting in the sampling methods becoming inefficient. In any case, if only considering &#8220;vector sum minimization&#8221; to draw the samples in each group, the final picking up samples may all be close to the cluster center, which means not well-distributed in the vector space and not well representative for their groups. For the above two problems, this study adopted a method to randomly draw a half number of the required samples in the first group. Moreover, drawing the other half of the samples that were closest to the mirror points of the taken samples in the first step was processed, and this method could possibly make the vector sum close to zero [<xref rid="B46-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The mirror points mean the two points with the same vector value, relative to the cluster center, in each dimension but opposite in the plus&#8211;minus sign. This action reduced the time complexity in sampling and also ensured, to a certain extent, a well-distributed representation in the vector space. The first reason addressed the need to lower the time complexity during sampling. Additionally, this study demonstrated the achievement of the lowest vector sum among the three sampling methods with clustering, as shown in <xref rid="diagnostics-14-00137-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The second reason aimed to ensure a reasonably even distribution throughout the vector space. If one were to calculate all possible permutations and combinations of vector sums, there was a potential risk of drawing most samples that are closely clustered around the center. This scenario may result in an insufficiently distributed sample set, failing to accurately reflect the real distribution within the vector space of that cluster.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>4.4. Strengths</title><p>The strength of this study was establishing the sampling method as vector sum minimization in textual data to become the feasible way for efficiently drawing the smaller amount of critical representative data. This process could help the clinical staff save a huge amount of time manually labeling a large amount of data for building the semantic text mining models. For example, each labeling to the radiology reports for VCF cost 1 min, whereas applying the sampling at the ratio of 1/40 from 30,000 textual data could save 39,250 min. Sampling the critical representative data to become the training set would make the better text mining models in extracting the information correctly. The sampling method of vector sum minimization might be a strong tool not only in radiology reports but also in other textual data in medicine.</p><p>The semantic text mining models to identify VCF employed in the FLS of E-Da Hospital met Standard 4 of CTF<sup>&#174;</sup> [<xref rid="B14-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Every radiology free-text report for spine X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were automatically reviewed by the models to recognize VCF and presented the list of the patients with VCF for the healthcare staff. The other models for identifying femoral fracture and osteoporosis were also built in a similar way as the models for determining VCF, utilizing the vector sum minimization sampling method. Under the assistance of the models, a total of 5746/245,764 reports of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/imaging exam of the spine and hip were analyzed in each year on average. An average of 9634/11,603/1047 patients with VCF/femoral fracture/osteoporosis were identified each year, and the recognition accuracy rate was 96.3%.

Limitations</title><p>This study has the following limitations. First, the enrolling textual data are in English; however, the applications of the vector sum minimization sampling method in other languages require further investigation. Second, this study was focused on VCF with 40.7% positive in enrolling data since the prevalence rate of the disease was the influent factor of text mining models [<xref rid="B48-diagnostics-14-00137" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Third, this study compared the performance of sampling methods across four sampling ratios. We observed a decline in performance with a reduction in the number of sampled data for the training set. However, an analysis of the minimum sample size required for the training set, which is crucial and practical, was not investigated in this study. Fourth, the LSTM algorithm was utilized to construct all the semantic text mining models. However, exploring advancements in neural network architectures could potentially enhance the performance of semantic text mining models, and other algorithms were not tested in this study. Fifth, although the sampling method performed well in our dataset across four sampling ratios, external validation is still necessary to assess its generalizability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-diagnostics-14-00137"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study confirmed the advanced sampling method, especially the vector sum minimization, in textual data that can efficiently build the semantic text mining models by drawing a small amount of critical representative samples and saving the time for labeling the large amount of samples. By efficiently building the models under the assistance of the sampling method, extracting the usefully clinical information could be achieved for further statistical analysis and clinical care such as identifying the undertreated patients who were diagnosed in textual reports without treatment. Meanwhile, the responsible reporters for the medical exam do not need to change their behaviors for typing the textual reports because the mining models could automatically extract the interesting information simultaneously.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
