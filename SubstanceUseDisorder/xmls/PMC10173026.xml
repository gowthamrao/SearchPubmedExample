In the evidence domain, themes included: (1) concerns about buprenorphine as well as (2) variable attitudes toward the ED as a site that should initiate buprenorphine treatment. In the context domain, themes included: (3) community treatment site capacity and structure and (4) payment and regulatory barriers that disincentivized community buprenorphine provision. In the facilitation domain, themes included: (5) need for trained substance use disorder treatment staff, (6) need for improved referrals/communication across health care sites and systems, and (7)

Despite the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommendation that buprenorphine itself is effective for treating OUD, and should not be withheld or contingent upon counseling or receipt of other forms of psychosocial intervention,<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> 1 person at site 3 (OTP) stated that &#8220;the Suboxone [buprenorphine-naloxone] is kinda like a Band-Aid on a bullet hole. They need the all-encompassing treatment to be able to be in recovery. The Suboxone [buprenorphine-naloxone] is just kinda a safety net for that.&#8221; In this case, the participant expressed concern that buprenorphine itself was not sufficient for OUD treatment, with counseling or other supports seen as a critical component of a treatment plan.</p><p>There was also fear that patients would divert or misuse ED-initiated buprenorphine. One person at site 3 (OTP) said: &#8220;They could say, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to the emergency room, get some Suboxone. Come on down and sell this.

Clinicians expressed concern that if patients potentially experienced precipitated withdrawal in this setting, it would be more difficult to engage them in future buprenorphine treatment attempts: &#8220;There was 1 case of maybe precipitated withdrawal&#8230;then, once they have that 1 bad experience, it&#8217;s really hard to get them onboard again&#8221; (site 13, academic low barrier clinic). On the other hand, some argued that starting treatment in the ED was a good thing: &#8220;If they are ready, it keeps 'em alive for 3 more days&#8221; (site 3, OTP).</p><p>Finally, there was concern generally that ED-initiated buprenorphine might attract patients who were not experiencing life-threatening emergencies. One participant at site 9 (academic addiction clinic) said, &#8220;It's giving the message that withdrawal is an emergency&#8230;It feels horrible, I'm sure it does, but it's not&#8212;you're not gonna die from opiate withdrawal. Is it appropriate to give it in the ER?

Some programs had very specific hours of operation and initiation protocols for prospective patients and strict patient caps. One program required newly admitted patients to participate in counseling for 5 days without being provided MOUD so that the patient would prove motivation for treatment, even if a patient had received ED-initiated buprenorphine:</p><disp-quote><p>They would still have to be admitted to our program. The way our policies are set up, they have to be a complete patient of ours before we medicate them&#8230;They need an H and P [history and physical examination]. They need labs&#8230;If they sent them as a walk-in, which is what they have been doing, they don&#8217;t get same day admission. They still do the holding group, as if someone came in, walked off the street&#8230;The holding group is set up to show their motivation and their investment for treatment. Once they've been in holding group roughly about 5 days, then we admit them. We don't give them medication. (site 3, OTP)</p></disp-quote><p>Another bottleneck for smooth transitions to MOUD in the community was that 1 program started all patients with observed buprenorphine initiations, a protocol that can be staff- and time-intensive. One participant noted, &#8220;The only challenge is we only have 1 Saturday clinic a month, so we&#8217;re not gonna do a first-day [observed] induction on a Friday&#8221; (site 9, academic addiction clinic).</p><p>Other programs were open access or low-barrier models emphasizing schedule flexibility. One person at site 13, an academic affiliated aftercare clinic described &#8220;when we have a walk-in who&#8217;s probably in withdrawals right there, and on that moment, that cusp of making a decision to seek treatment, we do everything we can to see them, if we can, even the same day&#8230;The trick is to get them dialed into someone who&#8217;s waivered and has a moment to see them as soon as possible.&#8221; Several of these low-threshold programs noted that polysubstance use was not seen as a barrier to buprenorphine treatment and that additional polysubstance use was not a reason to discontinue buprenorphine, endorsing a harm reduction philosophy.</p></sec><sec id="H3-4-ZOI230392"><title>Payment and Regulatory Barriers</title><p>Payment methods and regulatory barriers were also important in transitions. Several participants remarked upon structures of payment models as a major barrier to their ability to provide care to more patients. One respondent noted they could not increase the patient census: &#8220;As it stands now, the [state] has a unique payment system. It's just hard to expand capacity&#8230;We've been sort of capped at volumes from a couple of years ago&#8221; (site 3, OTP).</p><p>Another participant noted that there were financial disincentives to provide the medication at the outpatient level: &#8220;If they&#8217;re in the emergency room and it&#8217;s Friday or Saturday, I think there&#8217;d be somebody who would say, &#8216;Well, we have beds in detox,&#8217; as compared to, &#8216;Here&#8217;s a dose,&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t pay very well compared to outpatient&#8221; (site 2, OTP).</p></sec><sec id="H3-5-ZOI230392"><title>Need for Trained Staff</title><p>Community-based OUD treatment clinicians had suggestions for facilitation opportunities including asking for more peer navigators or linkage social workers. There was also a request for specialized OUD trained staff in the ED: &#8220;We need more people that are trained in addictions in the ED, because that seems to not be the case&#8221; (site 3, OTP).</p><p>Many felt that more peers, social workers, or recovery coaches were needed to enhance capacity and communication across both the ED and the community sites. There was also a call for local champions navigating across health care systems on all levels. One participant praised a local buprenorphine physician champion: &#8220;He&#8217;s very active in engaging those community relationships, so I&#8217;m sure he had a piece in that getting out there in the community and linking those together from the hospital to the outpatient addiction center&#8221; (site 10, office-based addiction practice).</p></sec><sec id="H3-6-ZOI230392"><title>Improved Referrals and Communication</title><p>Another consistent theme across programs included the need for better bidirectional care coordination between the ED and community sites. Disparate electronic medical record systems were specifically noted as a barrier. Some ED clinicians printed out discharge summaries, while others called and left messages for programs.</p><p>However, successful linkages between the ED and community programs were possible. In one community treatment program, patients were encouraged to write thank you notes to fire departments and EDs to communicate successes to upstream partners that &#8220;the patient got into treatment&#8221; (site 10, office-based addiction practice).</p><p>Another participant noted the benefits of peer recovery coaches in facilitating smooth transitions:</p><disp-quote><p>The peer recovery coaches are instrumental in making this happen. I got here off the train at 7:00 in the morning and there's the peer recovery coach. I said, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I walked a patient over.&#8221; The patient was in the emergency department, waited till we were open&#8230;There's nothing more impressive than taking a patient from the emergency department and actually walking them across the street to treat.&#8221; (site 7, OTP)</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="H3-7-ZOI230392"><title>Need to Address Sociostructural Marginalization</title><p>Many of the community-based treatment clinicians noted that social-structural marginalization experienced by patients, including poverty, homelessness and housing instability, and not being able to meet basic needs such as having an acceptable form of identification (eg, driver&#8217;s license) affected their perspectives on buprenorphine treatment. One clinician noted: &#8220;We&#8217;re basically looking, in the beginning, to stabilize our patients before we take that giant step in maintaining them because we&#8217;re not sure of their insurance, of their housing, the psychosocial aspect before we take on the role of maintaining our patients&#8221; (site 2, OTP). Homelessness and dual diagnosis mental health concerns were consistently mentioned. One clinician stated: &#8220;They don't know that services like ours exist. They think, &#8220;I can get meds, but how is that gonna help me with a place to sleep? Help me get my food stamps&#8221; (site 3, OTP). Focus group participants reiterated that while medication was important, solving these other structural forces associated with ongoing opioid use were equally important.</p><p>Transportation to and from appointments at the receiving community OUD treatment site was also a key barrier to transition to community programs. One person at site 8 (OTP) said: &#8220;Transportation-wise, if there&#8217;s money to say, &#8216;Hey, we&#8217;re gonna start you on buprenorphine. Let&#8217;s put you in a cab, put you in an Uber, get you to the place,&#8217; so that you do your intake...&#8221; Individuals based at programs that had access to transportation vouchers felt this service was essential.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI230392"><title>Discussion</title><p>This qualitative evaluation of perspectives of community-based OUD treatment clinicians and staff regarding ED-initiated buprenorphine for individuals with OUD uncovered important barriers and facilitators from essential partners. Key themes that emerged within PARIHS domains included negative attitudes of focus group participants toward buprenorphine as an effective treatment for OUD without adjunctive counseling beyond that provided by the prescriber, concerns over the ED as a treatment initiation site, limited capacity to accommodate referred patients, payment and regulatory barriers, as well as the needs for more addiction-trained staff, improved communication between EDs and community partners, and means to address the sociostructural needs of patients.</p><p>Our findings build on previous studies<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> that have examined how to strengthen the linkage from ED-initiated buprenorphine to community partners. On the ED side, studies<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> have documented barriers and facilitators to ED-initiated buprenorphine; one study<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> that interviewed both inpatient and outpatient clinicians implementing ED-initiated buprenorphine described referral incoordination, lack of a centralized referral agency, and outpatient clinicians noting lacking documentation of a visit and showing up without appointments. Another study surveyed community outpatient counselors about what could assist with buprenorphine treatment retention and they reported addressing social and structural factors as essential to engagement and retention.<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Importantly, many community treatment clinicians and staff viewed OUD treatment as a complex condition in which starting medication such as buprenorphine was fraught. Focus group participants had many concerns about prescribing the medication in the ED, inappropriate use of medication, lack of ability to access care that included counseling or other treatment modalities, and lack of ability to follow up at community sites if a patient&#8217;s social determinants of health were not addressed.</p><p>However, despite some barriers, our study highlights facilitators for promoting linkage of patients receiving ED-initiated buprenorphine to the community for ongoing MOUD. Specifically, facilitators of these linkages include low-threshold programs that will flexibly squeeze patients into an intake or evaluation to provide same day treatment on demand, having dedicated staff and financial resources to directly transport patients from the ED to community sites, champions across both sites facilitating communication, and programs that were able to address the sociostructural barriers to holistic improvement for OUD, including helping patients get identification cards, insurance, or housing. There was enthusiasm for dedicated peer navigators across 3 sites despite the lack of robust evidence.<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Future programmatic implementation should emphasize the education of existing addiction workforce staff on the evidence behind medication-first programs, in which provision of MOUD does not have restrictions or contingencies.<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> When considering research, clinical and policy implications, it is important to know that successful and smooth linkages are possible<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230392r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>; however, health systems and programs must be flexible and accommodating, lowering barriers to entry to MOUD and addressing patients&#8217; holistic needs.

The study took place in 4 urban centers, so it may not be generalizable to other urban, suburban, or rural locations. The study also might have selection bias and/or social desirability bias,<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> as focus groups were scheduled concurrently with study investigator site visits. However, to mitigate this, interviewers were not from any of the study sites and participants were encouraged to share both positive and negative experiences.<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In addition, some members of the research team who were part of data design and analysis also led focus groups<sup><xref rid="zoi230392r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>; aware of the possible risk to objectivity, separate team members conducted the data analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI230392"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Potential community-based addiction treatment partners to EDs offering buprenorphine initiation describe a lack of clear communication with EDs, concerns about buprenorphine, the appropriateness of the ED as a site for initiation, regulatory barriers, and being a part of programs that were inflexible. Focus group participants were additionally concerned about the provision of buprenorphine without simultaneously addressing the patient&#8217;s holistic social determinants of health needs as well as the need for streamlined linkage from social work or other health navigators. Our findings suggest that some community partners are open to ED-initiated buprenorphine linkages; however, there remain substantial educational and structural barriers. These linkages can be enhanced with streamlined communication, appropriate training and resources, and adoption of low threshold principles to provide continued MOUD treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI230392"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi230392r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group>.
