Throughout the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, First Nations organizations in Manitoba partnered with public health and Manitoba government officials to ensure First Nations had early, equitable and culturally safe access to COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccination. In this study, we examined whether prioritizing First Nations for vaccination was associated with faster uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among First Nations versus All Other Manitobans (AOM).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>In this retrospective cohort study, we used linked, whole-population administrative data from the Manitoba healthcare system (February 2020 to December 2021) to determine rates of COVID-19 diagnostic testing, infection, and vaccination, and used adjusted restricted mean survival time (RMST) models to test whether First Nations received their first and second vaccine doses more quickly than other Manitobans.</p><p>The cohort comprised 114,816 First Nations (50.6% female) and 1,262,760 AOM (50.1% female). First Nations were younger (72.3% were age 0 to 39 years) compared to AOM (51% were age 0 to 39 years) and were overrepresented in the lowest 2 income quintiles (81.6% versus 35.6% for AOM). The 2 groups had a similar burden of comorbidities (65.8% of First Nations had none and 6.3% had 3 or more; 65.9% of AOM had none and 6.0% had 3 or more) and existing mental disorders (36.9% of First Nations were diagnosed with a mood/anxiety disorder, psychosis, personality disorder, or substance use disorder versus 35.2% of AOM).</p><p>First Nations had crude infection rates of up to 17.20 (95% CI 17.15 to 17.24) COVID-19 infections/1,000 person-months compared with up to 6.24 (95% CI 6.16 to 6.32) infections/1,000 person-months among AOM. First Nations had crude diagnostic testing rates of up to 103.19 (95% CI 103.06 to 103.32) diagnostic COVID-19 tests/1,000 person-months compared with up to 61.52 (95% CI 61.47 to 61.57) tests/1,000 person-months among AOM. Prioritizing First Nations to receive vaccines was associated with faster vaccine uptake among First Nations versus other Manitobans. After adjusting for age, sex, income, region of residence, mental health conditions, and comorbidities, we found that First Nations residents received their first vaccine dose an average of 15.5 (95% CI 14.9 to 16.0) days sooner and their second dose 13.9 (95% CI 13.3 to 14.5) days sooner than other Manitobans in the same age group.</p><p>The study was limited by the discontinuation of population-based COVID-19 testing and data collection in December 2021. As well, it would have been valuable to have contextual data on potential barriers to COVID-19 testing or vaccination, including, for example, information on social and structural barriers faced by Indigenous and other racialized people, or the distrust Indigenous people may have in governments due to historical harms.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we observed that the partnered COVID-19 response between First Nations and the Manitoba government, which oversaw creation and enactment of policies prioritizing First Nations for vaccines, was associated with vaccine acceptance and quick uptake among First Nations.

Contributing factors that increase the potential for severe outcomes can include inequitable access to clean water, quality housing infrastructure, and medical services; moreover, Indigenous peoples may also experience discrimination in healthcare settings, thus compromising the standard of care they receive and discouraging them from accessing services when they are available. The negative impacts of under-funding of Indigenous health and social services also become more evident in public health crises like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and have been the subject of numerous policy papers recommending immediate action to protect and support Indigenous communities in navigating the ongoing challenges and recovery efforts related to the pandemic [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In Canada, the COVID-19 virus posed a greater health risk to Indigenous peoples (First Nations, M&#233;tis, and Inuit) than to non-Indigenous Canadians since it was first detected in early 2020. Throughout the early pandemic stages, First Nations living in rural and urban communities had a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and were more likely than the general population of Canada to experience severe outcomes following infection [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many feared that this public health crisis would be a repeat of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where the actual and extraordinarily high burden faced by First Nations peoples in Manitoba was initally unknown because First Nations-specific data were lacking. But through public health advocacy and support from First Nations leaders, collection of Indigenous identifiers in Manitoba became mandatory in May 2020 [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on First Nations peoples became clear: in 2020, First Nations people accounted for 17% of deaths, 33% of hospitalizations, and 55% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions from COVID-19 [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while representing less than 12% of the population in Manitoba [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During another wave of COVID-19 in May 2021, approximately 40% of deaths were Indigenous peoples in Manitoba [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Historically, pandemics have disproportionately affected marginalized groups in a negative way [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, First Nations experienced higher rates of hospitalizations and ICU admissions compared to other people in Canada [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], attributed at least in part to systemic and structural factors contributing to poverty, crowded living spaces, and lower quality of health services [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The H1N1 pandemic also highlighted how excluding Indigenous leaders from public health planning and limiting their access to population health data exacerbated existing health inequities between First Nations and others in Canada and prevented timely equity-informed policy adjustments [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Building from this previous experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and First Nations leadership in Manitoba worked together to optimize protective measures and minimize health inequities for First Nations.</p><p>Despite Indigenous Peoples&#8217; right to self-government in Canada being recognized and affirmed in the Constitution Act [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], First Nations continue to be impacted by systemic and structural barriers to high-quality healthcare [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Government&#8217;s failure to meet its treaty obligations [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] has prompted First Nations organizations in Manitoba to assume responsibility for improving quality of healthcare services [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and providing leadership in health policy development and implementation [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in Canada, Manitoba First Nations leaders recognized the risk to their people and leveraged their existing infrastructure to form the Manitoba First Nations Pandemic Response Co-ordination Team, a partnership between the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakinak, the First Nations Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba (FNHSSM), and Keewatinohk Inniniw Minoayawin, and coordinated by Ongomiizwin Health Services at the University of Manitoba [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the First Nations Pandemic Response Co-ordination Team has been pivotal in public health decision-making, providing reliable and culturally appropriate information, coordinating First Nations-led services, and advocating for priority testing and vaccination for First Nations [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As part of their efforts, multidisciplinary Rapid Response Teams were deployed to First Nations to conduct diagnostic testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations. First Nations leadership also collaborated with the Manitoba government to develop and implement COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration strategies to improve access for those that faced additional barriers (e.g., mobility and transportation challenges, reaching unhoused people) [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. And when the vaccine first became available in late 2020, First Nations were among the Manitobans soon considered to be at higher risk of infection (along with healthcare workers, older adults living in residential care facilities, and immunocompromised people), and thus were offered priority access to vaccination [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Against this backdrop of First Nations-led efforts to improve access to COVID-19 protective measures, we tested the hypothesis that First Nations in Manitoba would have higher COVID-19 testing rates, lower COVID-19 infection rates, and higher vaccination rates than other Manitobans, or at least equivalent rates. Moreover, because they had priority access to vaccination, we hypothesized that First Nations would have faster uptake of vaccines than other Manitobans once they became eligible to receive them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>In this retrospective cohort study, we used linked whole-population administrative data from the province of Manitoba, Canada to determine whether First Nations-led COVID-19 protective measures were associated with improved access to COVID-19 vaccination.

In this study, we aim to decolonize COVID-19 research, which in the broadest sense involves sharing power: the power to know, based on being in the world, and the power to do, according to one&#8217;s learned and sensory interactions with physical environments [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Our decolonizing approach also included active involvement of First Nations researchers in the project as co-investigators and decision-makers, from the proposal stage to analysis and dissemination.

The Repository contains linkable, de-identified, and individual-level administrative records on contacts with the health system, social services, the education system, and the justice system for virtually the entire population of Manitoba (&gt;99.9% of the Manitoba population). The records are de-identified (names and addresses removed), but are linkable to a central population registry by way of a scrambled numeric identifier (each person&#8217;s 9-digit personal health identification number) attached to each record by a third party before the records are transferred to the Repository. Through the whole-population registry, records from various databases can then be linked across domains and over time to conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The databases are subject to extensive quality assessment to ensure that standards for linkage accuracy, completeness, and other data quality metrics are met before they are used for population health research [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The specific databases accessed for this study were the Manitoba Health Insurance Registry (demographic characteristics of the Manitoba population); Canada Census and Statistics Canada public use data (small area-level income and postal codes); physician visit claims, hospital abstracts, and prescriptions from community pharmacies (primary healthcare, hospitalizations, and prescriptions, and these were also used to calculate the Charlson comorbidity index); and laboratory data from Diagnostic Services Manitoba (COVID-19 PCR tests, test results, and vaccinations).

Data from physician visit claims, hospitalizations, and prescription medications were used to identify people who sought provincially funded mental health-related services and to quantify physical health comorbidities using the Charlson comorbidity index; these were included as covariates in our statistical models.</p><p>The primary outcomes for the study were the following: (1) rates of COVID-19 diagnostic testing, infection, and vaccination; and (2) time to vaccination after becoming eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. A diagnostic test was defined as a PCR-based COVID-19 test administered at a provincial testing site and processed at a provincial laboratory; during the study period, the vast majority of COVID-19 testing was done at provincial sites since home-administered rapid antigen testing was not yet widely available in Manitoba. COVID-19 infections (positive/negative) were determined from the laboratory test results. Vaccination records in Manitoba include information on the type/brand of vaccine administered, the date of vaccination, and the number of doses received. We calculated crude monthly testing and infection rates using laboratory data from February 2020 to December 2021 and vaccination rates using vaccination data from December 2020 to December 2021. These timeframes align with the start of the pandemic in Manitoba (February/March 2020), the earliest date vaccines were available (December 2020), and the end of population-based diagnostic PCR testing for COVID-19 (December 2021). The denominator for the testing and infection rates was the entire population of First Nations or AOM, respectively, who met the inclusion criteria for the study cohort. For vaccination, the denominator was the age-eligible population in each study group (vaccination was rolled out from highest to lowest age group in both First Nations and AOM over the course of 2021).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were done in SAS/STAT software version 15.1 [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We generated descriptive statistics for the cohort using counts and proportions. To adjust for differences in sociodemographic characteristics when comparing First Nations with AOM, we used standardized differences with an a priori cut off of 10% to signal significant differences between groups. We used a negative binomial distribution with log link function to examine the association between being First Nations or AOM and the rate of COVID-19 diagnostic testing, infection, and vaccination. The log of person-days as an offset was used to account for partial residency. Model goodness of fit was assessed by dividing the deviance and the scaled deviance by their degrees of freedom and values were within the acceptable range. We also considered zero-inflated models, but the negative binomial distribution was a better fit. The covariates included in the models were: First Nations or AOM, age, sex, region of residence (urban/rural), income quintile, any mental health condition, and the Charlson comorbidity index.</p><p>We also examined the association between being First Nations or AOM and the time (in days) to first and second vaccination. We first used Cox proportional hazard models to assess these associations, but the assumptions of proportional hazards were violated in our study, prompting us to seek another approach. We selected RMST models, which are a good alternative to Cox proportional hazards models if the assumptions of proportionality of hazards are violated [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

We restricted the mean survival time calculation to 396 days from December 1, 2020, for both first and second vaccinations. The covariates included in these models are the same as those included in the negative binomial distribution above. With the RMST models, we tested whether First Nations were vaccinated sooner than AOM while First Nations had priority access to vaccination.

The majority of First Nations individuals (77.8%) lived in rural areas while only 35.3% of AOM were rural residents. The 2 groups had a similar burden of comorbidities, although a slightly higher proportion of First Nations (6.3%) had a Charlson comorbidity index of 3 or higher compared to AOM (6.0%). The prevalence of mental disorders was also similar between groups, although First Nations had a higher prevalence of substance use disorder than AOM (9.9% versus 2.8%).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pmed.1004348.t001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1004348.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Sociodemographic characteristics for Manitoba First Nations and All Other Manitobans.</title><p>Counts, proportions, and standardized differences between groups.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pmed.1004348.t001g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pmed.1004348.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Manitoba First Nations <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 114,816</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">All Other Manitobans <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1,262,760</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

However, collaborative efforts to develop and implement new testing and vaccine administration strategies to improve access were ongoing throughout the pandemic.</p><p>Globally, Indigenous people have had better COVID-19 outcomes in regions where there is not only Indigenous-specific data available, but also where they have been involved in the development and implementation of response plans [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In Manitoba, each First Nation organized testing and vaccination clinics in their own community to supplement the provincial public health programming. Some communities delivered the vaccinations with their own complement of nursing staff while others secured additional resources and support through the Rapid Response Teams. Community-specific data were collected by the province but were reported on an online dashboard managed by the Tribal Council Areas (groupings of First Nations), and biweekly updates on social media were provided through collaboration between FNHSSM, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and Ongomiizwin Health Services. This type of informative, inclusive, and participatory decision-making and policy development is key to preventing the spread of communicable illnesses (including COVID-19) in Indigenous populations [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The structural inequities and systemic racism experienced by Indigenous peoples nationwide have been brought to the forefront by the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although the results of our analysis provide valuable information to look back on and apply learnings for the future, retrospective studies do not typically provide the real-time information that is often critical in a public health emergency. Even when we look to lessons from the past, such as those from the H1N1 pandemic [<xref rid="pmed.1004348.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], strong advocacy and collaborative efforts are still needed to ensure equitable access to protective measures for vulnerable populations. Studies like this one are important to ensure First Nations&#8217; voices are heard and to provide important learnings about how Indigenous-led initiatives and partnership-based public health efforts can influence health outcomes.</p><p>This study demonstrates how First Nations&#8217; sovereignty over their data and their health priorities can support First Nations health and well-being during a public health emergency. Policies, programs, and public health messaging that prioritize First Nations and provide culturally relevant care can influence the speed of vaccine uptake and help provide important protections against the spread of a virus. To smooth the way for future partnerships and Indigenous self-determination, Canadian governments and health systems need to continue decolonizing health research and healthcare and redress the current and historical colonial structures that negatively impact the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pmed.1004348.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Test positivity rates for COVID-19 diagnostic testing among First Nations and All Other Manitobans.</title><p>Monthly moving average rates per 1,000 person-months and 95% CIs.
