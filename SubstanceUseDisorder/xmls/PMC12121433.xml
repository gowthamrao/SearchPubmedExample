Here, we investigated the epidemiology and genomic architecture of maternal smoking in a middle-aged population and compare the results to effects observed in the developing foetus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the current project, we included 351,562 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) and estimated exposure to maternal smoking status during pregnancy through self-reporting from the UKB participants about the mother's smoking status around their birth. In addition, we analysed 64 foetal liver transcriptomic expression datasets collected from women seeking elective pregnancy terminations. Foetal maternal smoking exposure was confirmed through measurement of foetal plasma cotinine levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Foetal exposure to maternal smoking had a greater impact on males than females, with more differentially expressed genes in liver tissue (3313 vs. 1163) and higher liver pathway activation. In the UKB, maternal smoking exposure was linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, lower education, and liver damage. In a genome-wide analysis in the UKB, we leveraged the shared genetic basis between affected offspring and their mothers and identified five genome-wide significant regions. We found a low heritability of the trait (&#8764;4%) and implicated several disease-related genes in a transcriptome-wide association study. Maternal smoking increased all-cause mortality risk (Hazard ratio and 95% CI: 1.10 [1.04; 1.16], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#160;=&#160;4.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>), which was attenuated in non-smoking males.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Although male foetuses are more affected than females by maternal smoking in pregnancy, this effect was largely reduced in middle-aged individuals. Importantly, our results highlight that the overall 10% increased mortality due to maternal smoking in pregnancy was greatly attenuated in non-smokers. This study demonstrates the importance of campaigns promoting offspring smoking prevention in families where the parent(s) smoke.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this project was provided by the <funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000882</institution-id><institution>University of Aberdeen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>, the Science Initiative Panel of the <funding-source id="gs2">Institute of Medical Science</funding-source>, the UK <funding-source id="gs3"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>, the <funding-source id="gs4">Seventh Framework Programme</funding-source> of the <funding-source id="gs5"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> under Grant Agreement <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs5">212885</award-id> (REEF), <funding-source id="gs6"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100023968</institution-id><institution>NHS Grampian</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> Endowments grants and the <funding-source id="gs7"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> Horizon Europe research grant Agreement <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs7">101094099</award-id> (INITIALISE).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Survival</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">

Additionally, 1135 genes overlapped between males and females across all stages analysed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;1</xref>). This indicates a potential for common pathways being affected by pregnancy maternal smoking for both sexes. To further dissect the biology at 11&#8211;19 weeks of gestation, and to identify any additional pathways that are different for both sexes, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;2</xref>). Foetuses demonstrated a substantial sex difference in their respective over- and under-represented pathways with the only similarities being observed for muscle development, cell cycle and signalling. Interestingly, males show an over-representation in pathways involving cancer development whereas those pathways are under-represented in females. We also observed an increase in DEG associated with inflammation, decreased synapse assembly, and alcohol and drug metabolism in males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;2</xref>a), but not in females.

Consistent with our previous analyses, the strongest effects were observed in the late second trimester group of males (over 16 weeks of gestation). Strikingly, results were consistent only in the male late study window, with significant z-score and 2-fold change activation/inhibition effects seen, further reflected in significant activation across overlapping canonical pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;3</xref>). All further reporting in this section is limited to the male late study window of 17&#8211;19 weeks of gestation. Of the top 20 canonical pathways by <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value, 12 had positive z-scores, indicative of activation, while only 2 exhibit negative (inhibition) z-scores (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure&#160;S1</xref>). Of the former, TR/RXR Activation, Tumour Microenvironment Pathway, Acute Phase Response Signalling, HIF1&#945; Signalling, and Hepatic Fibrosis Signalling, amongst others showed activation of most members/processes. For the latter, both Sirtuin Signalling Pathway and LXR/RXR activation pathway did not show a clear majority of pathway members/processes inhibited. Overall, the DEGs in cigarette smoke exposed and non-exposed male foetuses in the 17&#8211;19 weeks of gestation group mapped onto 10 main networks (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#160;S2</xref>), of which none were directly related to metabolism. Instead, they were associated with development and abnormal development processes, cell death, survival, morphology, and signalling as well as immune response and disease. This range of activities was largely reflected in the more than 2-fold activated/inhibited disease and biological functions (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#160;S3</xref>). Next, these data were further explored using IPA's regulator effects (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#160;S4</xref>).

We observed a weak positive correlation between male sex and maternal smoking during pregnancy as well as a negative correlation with age at baseline suggesting that males and younger individuals in general are more likely to report that their mothers smoked while pregnant. Additionally, the positive correlation between pregnancy maternal smoking and offspring pack years agrees with previous research suggesting that the children of maternal smokers are more likely to smoke themselves. Similarly, positive correlations were also observed for higher BMI, excessive alcohol consumption and deprivation index, a unit measurement of socio-economic status, which is supported by the observed strong negative correlation with education status.

The effects on offspring were then studied, utilising data from foetal human livers and middle-aged adults from the UK Biobank. We observed a strong sex bias in dysregulated gene expression in foetuses by just under five months of pregnancy (19 weeks of gestation) with males more affected than females. Additionally, in adult offspring, we noted a strong association of maternal smoking during pregnancy with biochemistry markers linked to liver and kidney function. Furthermore, we demonstrated sex differences in disease associations in relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy, with men more likely to develop gout, type II diabetes, become obese or suffer cancer and undergo chemotherapy. Whereas women had increased tendency for mycoses, back and abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anxiety, depression, and headache syndromes. Our genetic dissection of maternal smoking during pregnancy estimated a low heritability of 3&#8211;4% and further functional analysis of the associated SNPs identified genes involved in nicotine addiction, fatty acid metabolism, and neurodegeneration. Finally, we observed a difference in mortality due to sex and smoking status in adult offspring that associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy. Importantly, the excess risk due to pregnancy maternal smoking was reduced in males that had never smoked, but not in females.</p><p id="p0170">To uncover the social and personal impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy, we investigated its association with modifiable and non-modifiable lifestyle factors. We observed a negative correlation of maternal smoking during pregnancy with higher education attainment and age of participants at recruitment and a positive correlation with poor socioeconomic status (indicated in this study as deprivation index), which is in agreement with previous studies.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Indeed, previous reports indicated a decline in maternal smoking during pregnancy in recent years in high income countries as well as personal socioeconomic status and education<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> which agrees with our observed associations.

Interestingly, our results indicated a positive association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and male offspring sex. It is, however, not clear why male UK Biobank participants are more likely than female participants to indicate that their mothers smoked during pregnancy. Since there were no further questions regarding pregnancy maternal smoking status in the UK Biobank questionnaire, we cannot speculate on the precise mechanism behind this observation at present but in our foetal studies we do not observe a sex difference associated with validated pregnancy maternal smoking with equal numbers of male and female foetuses in smoking pregnancies across 20 years of observation. The negative association of age at recruitment and pregnancy maternal smoking is, however, quite striking. The association would indicate that younger UK Biobank participants (independent of sex, smoking status or education level) are more likely to report pregnancy maternal smoking than older participants. This could be due to a heightened awareness of younger participants about the adverse effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy as a consequence of smoking prevention strategies.</p><p id="p0175">To gain further insight into the biological basis of maternal smoking during pregnancy associated effects in adulthood, we investigated normalised counts of blood cells and biochemistry markers from whole blood. We observed a strong positive correlation to white blood cells and a strong negative correlation to red blood cells. Higher levels of white blood cells are a hallmark for inflammation,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> which is supported by the observed increased levels of C-reactive proteins in individuals exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Pertinently, inflammation is among the leading consequences of obesity which in turn leads to a variety of metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegeneration, osteoarthrosis, liver damage, and others.<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> Furthermore, inflammation pathways were also identified in our DGE pathway enrichment analysis. Interestingly, we found lower IGF levels in middle-aged individuals exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Generally, babies born to women who smoked during pregnancy have a lower birth weight and reduced foetal and adolescent growth.<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> Indeed, lower levels of IGF-1 were observed in umbilical cord blood if the mothers smoked during pregnancy<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> and this effect seems to be persistent even four decades later in life. Remarkably, we found a strong positive correlation between pregnancy maternal smoking status and GGT levels, across all considered groups. High concentrations of GGT correlate with an increased risk for liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> Considering our observations and since there is a strong interplay between these variables in modulating disease prevalence, they were used as adjustment in our PheWAS analysis.</p><p id="p0180">Smoking has a strong association with inflammation and thus a range of different diseases.<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> As such, combined with our observations of a strong association between pregnancy maternal smoking status and sex bias in relation to reported pregnancy maternal smoking, we decided to perform our PheWAS on non-smokers only for both sexes separately. The aim was to eliminate potential confounding on the observed disease associations, allowing us to examine the burden of maternal smoking during pregnancy more clearly on the health of future generations.

These findings are consistent with the findings in older men who had smoked themselves, indicating dysregulation in immune, developmental and metabolic function in association with maternal smoking during pregnancy. Although metabolic changes associated with maternal smoking in the foetuses were limited, as recently confirmed by us,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we have previously reported sex and pregnancy maternal smoking associated differences in the foetal liver and the thyroid, however, the mechanisms have not been elucidated.<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> Since it was only the 17&#8211;19 weeks of gestation males in the present study who displayed marked hepatic gene pathway consequences associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, this suggests the male late study window foetuses were experiencing adverse effects on liver development and possibly maladaptive hepatic responses to the toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke. The activation of a range of pathways, such as Acute Phase Response, in association to maternal smoking during pregnancy demonstrated a potential defencive response to inflammation, as is seen in second hand smokers.<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> Overall, when exploring disease pathways, we observed a stronger inhibition than stimulation of inflammation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure&#160;S6</xref>). Inhibition of the sirtuin pathway, combined with activation of the Hepatic Fibrosis signalling pathway is indication of potential first steps towards liver disease in the mid second trimester smoke exposed male foetuses since serotonin deficiency is considered to aggravate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> Recently foetal growth, in particular femur length, in a longitudinal study was reported to be detectably slowed, if the mother smoked during pregnancy, as early at 16&#8211;20 weeks,<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> while no body weight/length or organ weight associations with maternal smoking during pregnancy were observed. The authors concluded that organs like the brain and liver were protected at the expense of skeletal growth. Taken together, what we are observing in the foetal livers of foetuses whose mother smoke may be a combination of both protective and maladaptive responses, some leading to metabolic and liver disease. This is further reinforced by findings in two recent studies, associating maternal smoking during pregnancy with NAFLD and metabolic dysfunction hepatic disease.<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref></p><p id="p0190">Our GWAS was conducted in offspring exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. The rationale to use this population was the shared genetics with their mothers, which should carry half of the genetic effects observed here. Therefore, our heritability estimate of around 3&#8211;4% is likely too small and would be higher in women who reported maternal smoking during pregnancy themselves. Nevertheless, the low heritability suggests that the effects observed are mostly epigenetic which is supported by previous research in the field.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref> The results from our GWAS and TWAS indicate the involvement of genes related to tobacco addiction, fatty acid metabolism, and neurodegeneration, which together with our DGE pathway enrichment analysis presents a possible genetic basis for our observed associations and informs which mechanisms of action need to be further investigated. Although some sex bias was also observed in these analyses, very few genetic associations with maternal smoking during pregnancy were identified which could in part be due to the low sample sizes of each subgroup (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#160;2</xref>) combined with the stringent Bonferroni correction threshold. Additionally, we investigated the pattern of overlap between the foetal DGE and adult TWAS. Similarly to stronger effects observed for males in foetal livers only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;1</xref>), we note that males also had a substantially higher degree of overlap with the overall TWAS at every stage of pregnancy in the second trimester as compared to females and the pattern remained largely similar when restricting the TWAS analysis to liver tissue only further strengthening our notion of males being affected to a greater degree by the phenotype. In addition, with the applied <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value cut-offs, we would expect around five genes to overlap between the liver TWAS and DGE by chance. Here, we observed an excess of overlapping genes in the later stages of pregnancy in males and females, indicating that some of the observed associations in the DGE may be influenced by inherited genetic variants. Building on those results, the genes that do overlap should be examined in more detail to find out their precise function in the context of maternal smoking in utero and their genetic control.</p><p id="p0195">Finally, we examined the survival likelihood over five years of follow-up for the UK Biobank individuals. We note mortality was similar between males and females when exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Importantly, the mortality risk was further increased if individuals smoked themselves, suggesting an interaction between uterine and active tobacco smoke exposure.<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> Interestingly, when looking at subgroups according to smoking status we observed a markedly decreased mortality rate due to maternal smoking during pregnancy for never smokers compared to ever smokers. This observation has important implications for efforts to reduce the impact of pregnancy maternal smoking in our society. Briefly, men born to women who smoked during pregnancy should be strongly advised to never start smoking. This could greatly reduce their increased mortality due to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Such interventions could realistically be included in current anti-smoking counselling curricula as well as other preventive efforts.</p><p id="p0200">One strength of this study is that we combine genetic and transcriptomic data from prenatal and middle-aged groups. This increases our ability to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the life-long biological consequences of pregnancy maternal smoking for the individual. Although the UK Biobank cohort provides considerable statistical power due to its large sample size, caution is warranted in the interpretation of the results. Indeed, we present biological associations related to maternal smoking during pregnancy. However, one weakness of the UK Biobank study cohort is that maternal smoking during pregnancy status is based on self-reporting by the offspring (i.e., the participants) rather than the mothers themselves. Additionally, variables such as paternal smoking for both UK Biobank and human foetal collection cohorts, as well as social deprivation index (human foetal collection only), were not available and consequently not accounted for. While we were not able to control directly for paternal smoking, all the foetuses included in the human foetal collection study had levels of cotinine that exceeded the smoking cut-off, in addition to mothers reporting smoking status during pregnancy. Consequently, the principal exposure to smoking was via the mother. Furthermore, despite not being able to control for deprivation index in the human foetal collection cohort, our current foetal collection of nearly 400 foetuses, found no significant association between maternal smoking and the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref> This could have potentially skewed and introduced bias in the observed associations regardless of the steps taken to remedy that. Moreover, the UK Biobank and the human foetal liver analyses use two different tissues (blood and liver, respectively) which probably explains why we did not observe all the results from foetal tissue mirrored in adult individuals. Finally, we note that many of the observed associations from our cox proportional hazards models have confidence intervals overlapping between the various strata. Thus, we do not have enough power to detect whether there is a statically significant difference in the mortality estimates between smoking and non-smoking males and only note that the effect is largely attuned in nonsmokers.</p><p id="p0205">We observed that, compared to females, male foetuses are more affected by maternal smoking during pregnancy suggesting an early disruption and/or adaptation in developmental pathways. However, those effects were largely attenuated in middle-aged individuals, and we only observed a moderate sex difference in risk factors, future disease risk and mortality rates between men and women. Importantly, our results highlight that the increased mortality due to maternal smoking during pregnancy was severely attenuated in men who did not smoke themselves, as opposed to females for which hazard ratios were similar regardless of smoking status. Consequently, this imposes important implications for efforts to reduce the societal impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy. In our genetic dissection of pregnancy maternal smoking, we found that it is only weakly heritable in both offspring sexes. Nevertheless, we were able to highlight several genes and pathways likely to be involved in maternal smoking during pregnancy. By detailing those effects on the developing and post-natal liver, we have paved the way for future studies on the inherited molecular basis of maternal smoking during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0210">Conception and study design: Felix Grassmann, Paul A.
