is especially true among incarcerated populations, who are known to be at
particularly high risk of poor health outcomes. In this integrated literature
review, we (1) report what is known about the prevalence of substance use among
incarcerated pregnant and postpartum populations; (2) describe substance use
treatment programs and current care practices of pregnant and postpartum
populations in carceral settings; and (3) explore recommendations and strategies
for increasing access to substance use treatment for incarcerated pregnant and
postpartum populations. A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases
yielded in the retrieval of 139 articles that were assessed for inclusion. Of
the retrieved articles, 33 articles met criteria for inclusion in this review. A
review of the literature revealed that the understanding of substance use
prevalence among pregnant incarcerated women is limited. We also found that
treatment of substance use disorders among pregnant and postpartum populations
is not routinely available, enhanced perinatal services are sorely needed, and
substance use treatment programs are feasible with the help of community
partnerships. More research is required to understand current substance use
treatment initiatives and outcomes for pregnant women in prison. In addition,
strategies for integrating evidence-based, substance use treatment in carceral
settings is also needed. Future directions are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>incarceration</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>substance use</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-17455057221147802"><funding-source id="funding1-17455057221147802"><institution-wrap><institution>eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health

their arrest rates have risen by 25% over the past 35 years and the rate of women&#8217;s
incarceration has increased by over 750%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Currently, women comprise the
fastest growing correctional population, with Black, Latinx, and Native American
women being arrested and incarcerated at disproportionate rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Recent
incarceration data indicate that Black women are incarcerated at nearly double the
rate of White women, while Latinx and Native American women are incarcerated at
nearly 1.5 times the rate of White women.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The War on Drugs resulted in
increasingly punitive drug enforcement trends that caused a surge in women&#8217;s
incarceration, specifically among marginalized and minority women.</p><p>In general, women are more likely to be imprisoned for drug offenses compared to
their male counterparts, as the number of women convicted for drug-related offenses
increased nearly 15% since 1986.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> When considering racial
demographics, American Indian, Latinx, and Black women are more likely than White
women to be arrested, convicted, and serve time for drug-related offenses.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In relation to
substance use, estimates suggest that nearly 70% of incarcerated women would meet
criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>), with up to 90% self-reporting
a problem with substance use.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Expansive drug enforcement
policies contributed to a significant rise in the number of incarcerated women,
while incarceration simultaneously limited access to adequate substance use
treatment despite the need.</p><p>Of the women who enter prison, approximately 4% are pregnant upon intake.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although the
true prevalence of substance use among incarcerated perinatal populations is
unknown, we can assume that a substantial portion of women who enter prison pregnant
will meet criteria for an SUD given such high prevalence among incarcerated women in
general. Incarcerated pregnant women (It is assumed that all incarcerated pregnant
people are women in the studies included within this review. Many studies do not
adequately assess gender identity; thus, we do not know whether findings extend to
trans and non-binary perinatal populations.) have significant health care needs and
are disproportionately vulnerable to a multitude of complex health issues. Many of
these women have high-risk pregnancies due to economic and social factors, such as
unstable housing and homelessness; financial instability; lack of education; limited
and/or inadequate health care; and substance use and addiction.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Incarcerated
pregnant women and their fetuses are at risk of poor perinatal outcomes including
pre-term birth<sup><xref rid="bibr8-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and low birth-weight,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which are conditions that are
often exacerbated by substance use during pregnancy. Furthermore, neonatal
abstinence syndrome (NAS<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) is of great concern as it is a condition caused by fetal
exposure to substances in utero and causes withdrawal symptoms in the infant
post-birth.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Maternal incarceration adds to the complexity of treatment and
cost, as it is associated with increases in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
length of stay for infants born with NAS.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>As such, correctional facilities must be prepared to face the challenges of meeting
the immense health needs of perinatal populations in relation to substance use and
addiction. Incarcerated pregnant women who use substances prior to and/or during
pregnancy are at an increased risk of poor perinatal outcomes; however, the extent
to which carceral settings provide treatment for substance use is not well
understood. In the remainder of this article, we summarize themes among the current
state of literature related to the prevalence of substance use among incarcerated
pregnant and postpartum populations and the provision of substance use treatment
offered in correctional facilities. We also describe considerations,
recommendations, and strategies from previous studies to augment the care of
incarcerated pregnant and postpartum women, specifically those with concurrent
substance use using an integrative literature review approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-17455057221147802"><title>Method</title><p>The aim of this integrative literature review is to review, critique, and synthesize

barriers<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> in integrating treatment into their current system
or providing referrals upon release. For example, not all prisons can meet
the Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s (DEA) licensing requirements for
dispensing MOUD. According to regulations outlined by the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National
Commission for Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), methadone can only be
administered by DEA-licensed opioid treatment programs (OTPs), while
buprenorphine may only be administered by trained and waived medical
practitioners.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> However, if prisons
and jails are not DEA-licensed or have staff eligible for waiver, they can
partner with community-based OTPs or medical providers.</p><p>Recommendations by both NCCHC and ACOG, two large proponents of the expansion
of healthcare services in prisons, specifically stress the importance of
community partnerships in facilitating integration of evidence-based
practices into correctional settings. The NCCHC (2005) encouraged ongoing
collaborations between public health, community, public assistance, and
correctional agencies to meet the gender-specific healthcare needs of
incarcerated women, specifically in relation to pregnancy and substance use.
Thus, stakeholder partnerships can and should be leveraged to increase
capacity within these settings to create long-term, sustainable systems to
optimize maternal and child health.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Three articles discussed barriers correctional facilities, especially jails,

treatment specific to perinatal populations into carceral settings is
sparse; however, four studies provided overviews of existing models and
suggest that substance use treatment for pregnant and postpartum populations
is feasible and sustainable with the assistance from community health
organizations. One example described in the literature was the Women and
Infants at Risk (WIAR) residential treatment program for incarcerated,
pregnant, substance-using women in the Michigan state adult correction
system. WIAR reportedly works to increase the availability of substance use
treatment, reduce the effect and severity of drug exposure to fetuses,
reduce recidivism, promote community awareness of incarcerated pregnant and
postpartum women to improve services, and facilitate coordination among
relevant agencies to meet the complex needs of these women.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Women are eligible if they have a history of drug and/or alcohol dependence,
a non-violent offense, and a sentence of less than 2 years. Women agree to
actively parent their infant and remain in the program for at least 4 months
after the infant&#8217;s birth. Women remain incarcerated until they reach their
third trimester. Once women have reached their third trimester of pregnancy,
they are transported to WIAR&#8217;s community-based residential facility, roomed,
assessed for other needs (e.g. nutrition and clothing), and provided with
education materials regarding pregnancy, prenatal care, and breastfeeding.
Program staff assist with scheduling prenatal care and applying for
Medicaid. Women are then matched with a multidisciplinary team including a
nurse, social worker, and nutritionist. In addition to intensive prenatal
care, women are provided with individual counseling sessions, group therapy,
and didactic sessions for substance use. Unfortunately, &#8220;truth in sentencing
laws&#8221; enacted to reform judicial sentencing ultimately led to the demise of
the program despite 10 years of operation and successful, measurable
outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>In another example, Public Health-Seattle and King County Correctional

women who use substances.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> MOMS Plus connects
incarcerated, pregnant substance-using women to prenatal care and supportive
services inclusive of housing, counseling, and substance use treatment in an
effort to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. This
collaborative model of care involves public health agencies, county
corrections, community medical providers, substance use treatment centers,
and drug and mental health courts. Referrals are provided by the inmates
themselves, correctional officers, medical providers, courts, and state and
community corrections staff. Because incarcerated women&#8217;s needs are complex
and multifaceted, MOMS Plus case management works to connect incarcerated
pregnant women to services that are most likely to impact prenatal outcomes,

healthcare, and food programs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section11-17455057221147802"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together, results of this integrative review show significant gaps in research

pregnant and postpartum women is not routinely accessible. For MOUD, carceral
settings report providing MOUD treatment to pregnant populations; however, only a
small portion of these settings initiate such treatment or continue MOUD treatment
post-delivery despite being constitutionally mandated to provide healthcare and
treat incarcerated persons with &#8220;serious medical need&#8221; (<italic toggle="yes">Estelle v.

&#8220;serious medical need,&#8221; forced withdrawal is the most widely used method of
treatment, which can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. For pregnant

incarcerated pregnant and postpartum women is ripe with implications. In the future,
greater emphasis should be placed on policy development surrounding the creation and
use of existing diversion programs for women with substance use and addiction who

prison can serve as a viable site of retention. In addition, given the high
prevalence of trauma exposure among incarcerated populations, trauma-informed care
for incarcerated perinatal populations is paramount to successfully address and
treat SUDs.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>
Trauma-informed care practices recognize the role of violence and exposure to trauma
in the development of SUDs among women.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup></p><p>However, it is understood that some correctional facilities do not have the capacity
to treat SUDs, including OUD. To effectively integrate substance use treatment
services into carceral settings that are tailored to the needs of pregnant women,
criminal justice and public health agencies cannot continue working in isolation and
should focus on the development of partnerships. Carceral settings can benefit from
relationships with community-based providers to administer SUD treatment,
specifically MOUD. The incorporation of correctional facilities into a system of
care allows for incarcerated individuals to initiate, continue treatment during
incarceration, and connect to resources through referral to a provider upon release.
In addition, colleges, universities, and medical school personnel can serve as a
tremendous resource for the location SUD specialists and champion the integration of
evidence-based practices.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Researchers should consider guidance from international
models as well.</p><p>It should be noted that this population is marginalized and extremely
vulnerable&#8212;incarcerated and pregnant; thus, some women have felt coerced into
substance use treatment, specifically for OUD.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bibr63-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> Providers should be careful
in their recommendations regarding treatment to avoid coercion.<sup><xref rid="bibr64-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> Furthermore,
while this review includes programming in both prisons and jails, it should be noted
that these facilities are characteristically and fundamentally different, which
affects the healthcare they are able to provide.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p>Jails are operated by city or county jurisdiction, house individuals for sentences
less than 1 year, and release dates can be unpredictable. Because each jurisdiction
has the freedom to create their own healthcare policies with little regulation, the
care available varies. This stresses the importance of community partnership and
involvement, especially when determining the medical or mental healthcare needed
among pregnant and postpartum populations. Furthermore, because jail facilities
typically house those with short-term sentences, community-based and/or residential
diversion programs should be considered for pregnant women as alternatives to
incarceration. Some jails offer diversion programs designed to connect individuals
with pre-existing mental health and substance use problems to treatment services and
often reduce jail time in return.<sup><xref rid="bibr65-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> Although pilot programs
created specifically for pregnant, incarcerated women have been difficult to sustain
due to political climate and available resources,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> diversion programs should be
used more frequently for incarcerated pregnant women as they could potentially
benefit both maternal and infant health<sup><xref rid="bibr66-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> by facilitating the
connection to resources such as mental, physical, and perinatal care.</p><p>Alternatively, prisons are operated at the state or federal level and required to
adhere to a minimal standard of care. Despite prisons housing individuals for
sentences longer than 1 year and more predictable release dates, there is no
mandatory standard of healthcare defining what is considered to be minimal care and
the services that must be provided.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Nonetheless, healthcare
spending in jails and prisons, quality of care, medical expertise, and organization
structure vary widely across facilities and services provided to women.</p><sec id="section12-17455057221147802"><title>Limitations</title><p>A few limitations should be acknowledged. First, it is possible our review is
limited by key phrases and search terms used for our database search, databases
we could access, and the method of the literature search. It is possible that
additional studies exist and were not included within our original search. Also,
our review was limited to only studies conducted within the United States and
published in English. Second, our conclusions were limited by the existing data.
We were unable to assess for income and racial disparities that exist between
incarcerated perinatal populations; however, we recommend that future studies
examine such differences. Finally, the articles included within our review
spanned nearly two decades. As a result, the socioeconomic and political climate
are likely to have varied among the studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section13-17455057221147802"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Incarceration could present an opportunity to provide pregnant women with access to
critical healthcare services that might otherwise be inaccessible,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> in turn
increasing the possibility of continued healthcare utilization
post-release.<sup><xref rid="bibr67-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> An overwhelming majority of incarcerated pregnant and
postpartum women report illicit substance use both prior to and during pregnancy,
yet carceral systems are deficient in providing treatment for addiction among this
population. Despite the abundance of evidence of long-term effectiveness of SUD
treatment programs for pregnant women in the community,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr67-17455057221147802" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> the scarcity of empirical
data and research of incarcerated pregnant women suggests there might be an unmet
need of pregnancy-focused SUD treatment for these women. Incarcerated pregnant women
and their infants possess significant health care need. Initiation of SUD treatment
and aftercare planning through community-based organizations in all carceral
settings upon intake and release can help facilitate a smooth transition back into
the community and engender lasting benefits for both maternal and infant health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Stefani Gafford, our Health Science Informationist
