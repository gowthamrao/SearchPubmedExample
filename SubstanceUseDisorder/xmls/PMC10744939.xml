While socioeconomic factors and familial relationships have been widely reported to contribute to SV, the role of alcohol consumption should not be ignored. Indeed, alcohol can impair cognition, distort reality, increase aggression, and ease drug-facilitated sexual assault. This retrospective study aims to explore the relationship between alcohol consumption and SV by examining the prevalence, characteristics, and consequences of violence episodes. <italic toggle="yes">Materials and Methods</italic>: A total of 1481 women accessed the Rape Centre &#8220;Centro Soccorso Violenza Sessuale&#8221; in Turin, Italy between 2008 and 2019, with 223 reporting alcohol consumption before the assault. <italic toggle="yes">Results</italic>: The alcohol group had a younger age profile, predominantly within the 18&#8211;25-year-old category. SV incidents involving alcohol consumers were more likely to occur in public places or in someone else&#8217;s home, while the non-alcohol-consuming group experienced more violence in their own homes. Acquaintances and unknown individuals were primarily responsible, whereas partners were the most common perpetrators of violence against non-alcohol-consuming women. Alcohol consumers sought medical attention sooner after the assault and exhibited more symptoms and injuries, particularly of neurological origin. Concurrent use of recreational drugs was higher among alcohol consumers. The logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds of injury for Italian women and those in the 18&#8211;35 age groups after consuming alcohol. <italic toggle="yes">Conclusions</italic>: This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between alcohol consumption and SV. The prevalence of alcohol-related sexual aggression is lower compared to that shown in previous studies. Nationality, age, and assailant identity influence SV dynamics. These findings can guide well-targeted interventions and prevention strategies to address SV and inform communities facing similar challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sexual violence</kwd><kwd>rape</kwd><kwd>alcohol intake</kwd><kwd>risk factors</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-medicina-59-02098"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Sexual acts that are not consensual and are frequently acquired through force, coercion, or the use of psychological and/or physical intimidation can happen to individuals of all ages and genders and are classified as sexual violence (SV). SV is a severe global public health problem with significant physical, psychological, and social consequences for survivors. While it can happen to anyone, women are disproportionately affected with up to one-third of them experiencing sexual violence at some time in their lives [<xref rid="B1-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2019, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified different risk factors for SV; among them, socioeconomic status, familial relationships, and racial and ethnic background are of paramount importance [<xref rid="B2-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, as emphasised in previous studies [<xref rid="B3-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the role of alcohol consumption should not be neglected, since many sexual assaults involve alcohol intake by the victim, the perpetrator, or, more commonly, both [<xref rid="B9-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between alcohol consumption and SV is complex and multifaceted, with various factors related both to the effects of alcohol and to its social and cultural significance that may contribute to the likelihood and nature of SV [<xref rid="B10-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Alcohol effects include a reduction in cognitive and physical functioning that, in turn, impairs self-control, with the consequent effect of reducing the ability to solve conflicts non-violently [<xref rid="B12-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, it induces a misperception of reality, reduces the perceptive capacity regarding dangerous situations and leads to difficulty in opposing resistance [<xref rid="B13-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, in some people, excessive alcohol consumption increases sexual desire and emotional instability [<xref rid="B14-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In particular, it has been observed that individuals of the male gender, as a result of ethanol intake, tend to have aggressive attitudes, resulting in the perpetration of sexual impositions [<xref rid="B11-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The mediation of alcohol and psychoactive substances in sexual interactions is a widespread phenomenon. Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is a form of sexual violence in which drugs or alcohol are used to incapacitate the victims, making them more vulnerable to assault. DFSA is a particularly insidious form of sexual violence, as it can be difficult for victims to remember or accurately report what has happened to them [<xref rid="B17-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the use of drugs such as Rohypnol or Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB) in DFSA, as well as the potential for other drugs, such as benzodiazepines or opioids, to be used in this context [<xref rid="B18-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alcohol is often consumed in combination with cannabinoids or benzodiazepines for recreational purposes [<xref rid="B19-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The effects of these substances can impair judgement, decrease inhibition, and cause memory lapses, leaving individuals vulnerable to sexual coercion or assault. Some psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, can affect reactivity and alter cognitive and emotional functioning, potentially increasing the risk of sexual assault [<xref rid="B23-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, women with mental health disorders may face additional barriers to protecting themselves from SV, including social isolation, stigma, and the lack of a support system. It should be also taken into consideration that, as demonstrated in our previous work that, sometimes, women regularly consume drugs that act on the central nervous system (CNS) for therapeutic purposes, and the synergistic effects of these drugs can amplify the inhibitory effects of alcohol [<xref rid="B25-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite the well-established link between alcohol consumption and SV, few studies have specifically compared the prevalence and nature of SV in women who consume alcohol compared with those who do not. This is a relevant gap in the literature, as understanding the unique risks and protective factors associated with alcohol consumption may help to inform more targeted interventions and prevention strategies, ultimately reducing the burden of this devastating public health problem.</p><p>Therefore, this observational study aims to address this gap by providing evidence on the status, characteristics, consequences, and risk indicators of SV in relation to alcohol consumption. In our previous study [<xref rid="B25-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we explored the characteristics of episodes of sexual violence in a population attending the Rape Centre &#8220;Centro Soccorso Violenza Sessuale&#8221; (SVS) at Sant&#8217;Anna Hospital in Turin, where healthcare personnel suspected the use of alcohol or drug abuse. To deepen the understanding of victimisation in sexually assaulted women who&#8212;voluntarily or involuntarily&#8212;had consumed alcohol, we expanded our previous database and introduced more stringent inclusion criteria. For this reason, we selected a population of women who had self-reported alcohol consumption, and we compared them with a non-alcohol-consuming control population.</p><p>This analysis could help to better understand a problem resulting from the intersection of global influencing factors, obtaining conclusions that are transferable to other communities sharing the same behavioural model.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-medicina-59-02098"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-medicina-59-02098"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study, based on data collected from the medical records of sexually abused female patients who were examined at the Rape Centre &#8220;Centro Soccorso Violenza Sessuale&#8221; (SVS) at Sant&#8217;Anna Hospital in Turin, Italy between 1 January 2008, and 31 December 2019. The SVS is one of the two Italian centres dedicated to violence against women (sexual violence, violence in pregnancy, violence against migrant women). In particular, it is the reference health service for the Piedmont region and is equipped with a dedicated and all-female multidisciplinary team (gynaecologists, midwives, social workers and psychologists). All women accessing the SVS at the time of the clinical/forensic evaluation for SV are routinely requested to sign written informed consent for clinical/gynaecological procedures and the collection of forensic specimens.</p><p>The research protocol complied with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans (2013) and with the General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and Provision no. 146/2019 of the Italian Privacy Guarantor. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the &#8220;A.O.U. Citt&#224; della Salute e della Scienza di Torino&#8212;A.O. Ordine Mauriziano di Torino&#8221; (CE 112/2020) on 6 July 2020.</p><p>We consecutively enrolled all women aged 14 years or older into the study. They were allocated to the &#8220;alcohol&#8221; group if they reported consuming alcohol prior to the sexual assault, and therefore the information was available in their medical records. To select the control group, we included 320 women who reported sexual abuse and declared no alcohol intake. The control population was randomly chosen from women who did not report alcohol consumption while adhering to the distribution of the reference group over the years. Random selection was conducted to avoid introducing bias in the composition of the population concerning factors such as the average age and origin. The population represents 25% of all women who accessed the SVS for sexual violence without alcohol intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-medicina-59-02098"><title>2.2. Data Collection</title><p>For issues related to confidentiality, the medical records are on paper and are kept in locked files in dedicated places accessible only by the staff of the centre. The data were extracted from one author and checked by a second author who was on the staff of the SVS Centre. Women were assigned to the &#8220;alcohol&#8221; group if they reported alcohol consumption before their sexual assault. For the control group (320 women reporting abuse but no alcohol intake), we meticulously aligned the selection with the reference group&#8217;s yearly distribution. Controls were randomly chosen, ensuring consistency with the reference group across years to prevent bias in factors like the average age and origin. Sociodemographic data and relevant information about violence episodes were gathered from the women&#8217;s health records and then registered into a database administered by the SVS staff. Considering age and nationality, women were classified into six age groups (14&#8211;17; 18&#8211;25; 26&#8211;35; 36&#8211;45; 46&#8211;55; and over 56 years of age) and categorised as &#8220;Italian&#8221; or &#8220;foreign&#8221;. The following characteristics of the episode of violence were noted: the location, the time elapsed from the violent episode to the medical examination, the relationship with the aggressor, and the number of attackers; if the woman was not able to provide information about the assailant, it was defined as &#8220;not known&#8221; (or, if more than one, &#8220;unknown group&#8221;). Data on recreational substances or drugs active on the central nervous system (CNS) that the women declared use of, occasionally or as prescriptions, were also collected.</p><p>Signs and symptoms, the types of injuries, and the body areas involved were used to classify the episode. Moreover, among the psychological conditions and psychic symptoms itemised in a checklist contained in the violence kit and registered on the medical record by specialised medical staff (psychologist or psychiatrist, as needed), we considered only those most frequently associated with the intake of alcohol (i.e., anterograde amnesia, hallucinations, numbness, confusion). The information about the type and quantity of alcohol assumed and the time between alcohol consumption and sexual violence was too limited and unreliable to be included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-medicina-59-02098"><title>2.3. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Values of quantitative variables were expressed as the mean &#177; standard deviation, while values of categorical variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies. A comparison between aggressed women who consumed alcohol or did not was conducted with the &#967;<sup>2</sup> test for the categorical variables and by the independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test for the quantitative variables.</p><p>A multiple logistic regression analysis was designed to identify risk indicators of sexual aggression related to alcohol consumption (yes vs. no), and the location of sexual violence (own private home vs. other), which were considered outcome variables. Model building was carried out using a purposeful selection of variables strategy. Initially, a preliminary analysis was carried out using univariable models, and all variables presenting <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values &lt; 0.25 were entered in the multivariable models. A backward select procedure with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value cut-off at 0.05 was used to identify the set of independent variables in the final models. Using this approach, risk indicators for sexual aggression mediated by alcohol consumption included nationality (dichotomised as Italian and foreign) and the age of the victim (categorised into four groups: 14&#8211;17 years, 18&#8211;25 years, 26&#8211;35 years, and &gt;35 years), location of aggression (public place, own home, someone&#8217;s home, other), and relationship with the assailant (partner, acquaintance, unknown to the victim). Risk indicators for the location of sexual violence were nationality and age of the victim, relationship with the assailant, and alcohol intake (as dichotomous). Data were presented as the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Wald tests were used to estimate the statistical significance.</p><p>The data analysis was performed using SPSS version 28 (Chicago, IL, USA). <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-medicina-59-02098"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>We conducted a retrospective evaluation of rape events involving women who accessed the SVS centre after consuming alcohol before the assault. Far from blaming the victims who have consumed alcohol, the present study aims to provide a more in-depth analysis of the profile and context of these episodes of violence and to identify if such an assault has similar or different features compared to an analogous episode perpetrated in the absence of alcohol. This is a relevant issue since women have increased their alcohol consumption, which was, until the recent past, an exclusive feature of males. In the United States, between 2001 and 2013, there was a 16% increase in the proportion of women drinking alcohol, a 58% increase in women with heavy alcohol consumption (versus 16% for men), and an 84% increase in the annual prevalence of alcohol use disorders in women (compared to 35% in men) [<xref rid="B27-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. According to the periodical survey performed by the Italian official statistical institute [<xref rid="B28-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in 2020, in Italy, 56.2% of women over the age of 11 had consumed at least one alcoholic beverage during the year. Ethanol consumption is often adopted as a form of emancipation and a manifestation of adequacy of their role in society [<xref rid="B29-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, women are characterised by a greater vulnerability to the effects of ethanol due to the lesser extent of the gastric isoform of alcohol dehydrogenase [<xref rid="B30-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The short-term effects of this substance mainly involve the CNS. Firstly, it causes an excitatory action on the brain functions, which, as the concentration of ethanol in the blood increases, becomes depressant through the interaction with the neurotransmitter systems that regulate the mechanism of cortical inhibitory control. GABAergic (inhibitory) transmission is potentiated by ethanol through the facilitation of binding between GABA and its receptor, also at small concentrations (5&#8211;50 mM) [<xref rid="B31-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>We analysed the number of events referred to the SVS at Sant&#8217;Anna Hospital in Turin. The total number of women accessing the SVS was nearly constant in the years before 2016, when a peak occurred. While the number of the total cases decreased from 2016 to 2019, in this time frame, the number of events related to alcohol consumption increased. This trend partially overlaps with what is reported in Li&#8217;s [<xref rid="B32-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] meta-analysis, where the rate of sexual violence against women was found to be significantly increased from 2010 to 2019 (0.33, 95% CI = 0.27&#8211;0.37) compared to in the period from 2001 to 2009 (0.20, 95% CI = 0.16&#8211;0.25). The frequencies reported in our study are comparable, during the overlapping period, to those reported by Ricard-Gauthier [<xref rid="B33-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] at the Emergency Obstetrics and Gynaecological Unit of the Geneva University Hospitals. However, the population size of Geneva in that period was less than 200,000 (UN data), while the city of Turin, where the SVS is located, had a population that was four times larger (ISTAT data). From 2010 to 2017, a total of 2065 cases of sexual assault were documented [<xref rid="B34-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] at the Centre for Victims of Sexual Assault at the Edith Wolfson Medical Centre, which caters to a significant population from the Tel-Aviv area and its neighbouring suburbs in Israel. It is noteworthy that the population of Tel-Aviv during the study period was approximately 430,000 individuals (UN data). In the study conducted by Morgan and Long [<xref rid="B35-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], it is documented that between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2016, a total of 7082 individuals presented to three sexual assault referral centres in Greater London following alleged sexual assaults. However, it is challenging to directly compare these data with ours, as the study does not provide stratification of the victims based on sex. A substantial increase in hospital visits related to sexual violence was also reported in a cross-sectional study [<xref rid="B36-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] utilising sexual assault data from the US Nationwide Emergency Department spanning from 2006 to 2019. The study revealed a remarkable rise of over 1533.0% in sexual-assault-related emergency department visits, with numbers escalating from 3607 cases in 2006 to 55,296 cases in 2019. Therefore, considering the aforementioned studies, despite the evident differences among the contexts examined, we observed a lower proportion of women seeking assistance at the rape centre in Turin.</p><p>Throughout the 12 years of the present survey, about 15% of the women entering the SVS declared alcohol consumption before being assaulted, and most of them declared voluntary intake. This percentage is lower compared with previous data in the literature. Ricard-Gauthier [<xref rid="B33-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found that 48% of sexually assaulted patients reported alcohol consumption. Abbey&#8217;s study reported that approximately half of all sexual assault victims declared that they were drinking alcohol at the time of the assault, with estimates ranging from 30 to 79 percent [<xref rid="B37-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is largely known that alcohol promotes the likelihood of impulsive/inappropriate action by suppressing the ability to anticipate and to consider the negative immediate and delayed consequences of such actions [<xref rid="B38-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, alcohol-induced cognitive impairments might reduce one&#8217;s ability to evaluate risk and its motor weakening effects might limit the ability to resist effectively. However, in our study, a causal link between alcohol and vulnerability to violence was not established.</p><p>Numerous studies [<xref rid="B39-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have established a strong association between sexual violence perpetrators and their victims who are under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, regardless of the perpetrators&#8217; own substance use. Consequently, individuals who have experienced sexual assault may be coerced into consuming alcohol or unknowingly subjected to its administration. In such instances, the term drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is employed to describe these occurrences. In our study, the percentage of individuals who reported forced or unaware consumption of alcohol is 6.3%. Nevertheless, with the present data, we cannot state if, in our population, alcohol is a favouring factor.</p><p>In the current study, the mean age of the population who declared alcohol consumption is lower than that of the control population. These findings align with the concerns raised by the global health organisation highlighting the increasing trend of alcohol consumption among youth and the progressively younger age of alcohol consumers [<xref rid="B42-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It deserves to be underlined that the legal drinking age in Italy is 18, which means these young women were illegally consuming alcohol.</p><p>The alcohol group comprised nearly half of the women aged 18 to 25, while this age range represents one-third of the control group. It could be argued that the most represented age cohort in the alcohol group corresponds to the age range when nightclubbing is more frequent, often involving alcohol consumption. Moreover, the control group consisted equally of Italian and foreign women, whereas in the alcohol group, Italian women constituted two-thirds of the population. It could be hypothesised that foreign women, due to cultural or religious reasons (11% of our sample consists of women from predominantly Muslim countries), consume less alcohol or declare drinking less when seeking assistance. Additionally, it is possible, although extremely difficult to prove, that they may not seek assistance if they have been assaulted after consuming alcohol.</p><p>Considering foreign women, in our research, the nationalities predominantly represented were Romania, Morocco, Peru, and Nigeria. When comparing the number of cases with the official population of each nationality residing in Turin, it is evident that the ratio of victims to the total number of women from those nationalities is significantly higher for these four nationalities (especially Peru and Nigeria) compared to Italian women. Within these populations, the proportion of Peruvian women who reported alcohol consumption (0.329) is notably higher compared to Nigerian women (0.116). Conversely, the latter have a much higher proportion (0.580) of cases where alcohol consumption was not reported, indicating a contrasting pattern between the two groups. This difference between the two nationalities can find an explanation in the stories of women reported in their medical records. Often, Peruvian women stated that they consumed alcohol during parties/gatherings with compatriots, where they were later abused. The majority of Nigerian women who sought help at the SVS Centre, on the other hand, told stories of abuse suffered while engaging in prostitution. These observations emphasise the importance of considering both the nationality and type of alcohol consumption when analysing the prevalence of assault among foreign women. It is crucial to identify the underlying factors contributing to these differences and to develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of each population.</p><p>Our analysis also sheds light on the relationship between alcohol consumption and the location where violence was perpetrated. It is interesting to note that, in public places and in someone else&#8217;s home, the prevalence of violence was higher among women who had consumed alcohol compared to the control group. This suggests a potential association between alcohol consumption and an increased vulnerability to violence in these specific settings. On the other hand, the control group showed a significantly higher occurrence of violence in one&#8217;s own home. Alcohol consumption influences the location of violence and the identity of assailants. Indeed, women raped in their own homes and someone else&#8217;s home showed different profiles based on alcohol consumption. Italian women who consumed alcohol were more frequently victimised in cases of domestic violence, while foreign women were more prevalent in the control group. Age also played a role, with women aged 18&#8211;25 facing higher risks in public places after alcohol consumption. Non-drinking women were more often victimised in their own homes. These findings emphasize the need for targeted prevention strategies considering specific factors in sexual assault cases.</p><p>When considering the total population of our study, the assailant was unknown in 36.3% of cases, while 57.8% of victims knew their aggressor; these findings are comparable with those reported by Loder and Robinson [<xref rid="B44-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in their retrospective US survey, while there was a reversal from the study of Ricard-Gauthier [<xref rid="B33-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The aggressor is the partner significantly more frequently in the control group, and particularly in foreign women, suggesting that he is responsible for violence, especially in the absence of alcohol consumption. Moreover, the aggressor is an acquaintance in most of the minor cases, particularly if they consumed alcohol.</p><p>The majority of women who consumed alcohol accessed the SVS within the first 24 h after the event. We can speculate that this difference is due to the presence of other symptoms pushing the search for medical assistance. In fact, at clinical presentation, women who consumed alcohol had a higher rate of lesions, namely, multiple injuries excluding the genital area and neurological symptoms (mostly amnesia and confusion).</p><p>Women who experienced violence after consuming alcohol declared significantly higher consumption rates for benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, and antidepressants. In the context of chronic treatment, it is noteworthy that women who experienced SV after consuming alcohol had higher utilisation of benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Consistently, this increased usage and the association between benzodiazepine consumption and unhealthy alcohol use was suggested in Hirschtritt&#8217;s [<xref rid="B45-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] study. When benzodiazepines and alcohol are used concurrently, several toxicological interactions with significant clinical implications can occur [<xref rid="B46-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>While there was no difference between the alcohol and control groups in the rate of women consuming SNC-active medications, the difference was significant when considering recreational drugs, whose use was higher within the alcohol group. Moreover, the victims in the control group who declared their consumption mostly affirmed that they were forced to use these drugs.</p><p>We also performed adjusted assessments of factors related to sexual aggression, considering alcohol intake and the location of the violence as outcome variables. The multiple regression analysis revealed that Italian women and those aged 18&#8211;25 and 26&#8211;35 years had higher odds of being injured after consuming alcohol. Violence by unknown individuals or acquaintances and in someone else&#8217;s private home was more likely when alcohol was involved.</p><p>Overall, this research sheds light on the interplay between alcohol, specific demographics, and the context of sexual violence, providing, consistent with the reliability of a retrospective study, valuable insights into the factors associated with the risk of injury in a population living in the northwestern Italian area.</p><p>Despite the large population examined, our results should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The analysis stopped in 2019, because with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, people&#8217;s habits and societal conditions changed, including the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and violence rates [<xref rid="B47-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-medicina-59-02098" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, the information on alcohol/drug consumption was based on declarations from the women. One limit common to retrospective studies is that their reliability is contingent on the accuracy and completeness of existing records, with incomplete or inaccurate data posing a threat to the overall study quality. Additionally, we enrolled only one-third of the total control population, although this was randomly chosen in order to avoid any selection bias. Finally, it is difficult to compare our results with analogous studies since, to the best of our knowledge, few published surveys had a case-control design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-medicina-59-02098"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The study conducted an explorative retrospective evaluation of sexual violence episodes involving women who had consumed alcohol before being assaulted. Our findings show that alcohol consumption is associated with specific risk factors and injury patterns. The study highlights the need for targeted prevention strategies when addressing the complex interplay of alcohol demographics and sexual violence. Our findings can guide targeted interventions and prevention strategies to address sexual violence and inform communities facing similar challenges.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
