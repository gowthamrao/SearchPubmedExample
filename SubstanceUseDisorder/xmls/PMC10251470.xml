The Young Minds Matter survey of Australian young people estimated that 10.9% of 12&#8211;17 year olds, or 186,000 young people, reported they had self-harmed at some point in their life and 8.0% reported they had self-harmed in the 12&#160;months prior to the survey.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr2-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> The Plan is underpinned by eight priority areas to achieve improved mental and physical health and effective suicide prevention and mental health (MH) service delivery is a strong underlying component. The Plan proposes that Australians with severe mental illness (estimated at approximately 3% of the population) should be provided multidisciplinary clinical care as well as appropriate pharmacotherapy, inpatient services and psychosocial support services.</p><p>Many individual and systemic barriers to help-seeking exist, especially in young people. Individual barriers include lack of faith that available supports can help, lack of knowledge of available supports and associated costs.<sup>

</sup> Major systemic barriers include lack of available services, limited government funding, lack of knowledge/training in mental health/suicide prevention in the workforce and fragmented health policies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

</sup> Briefly, a national household survey was conducted in 2013&#8211;2014, with 6,310 randomly selected Australian families. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in parents of 4&#8211;17 year olds and a self-report questionnaire completed by children and adolescents aged 11&#8211;17&#160;years. The current study uses data for children and adolescents aged 12&#8211;17&#160;years.</p><p>Survey data was linked to individual records from the MBS and PBS from the child&#8217;s birth until 31 December 2015. Under the MBS all Australian citizens and residents receive subsidised healthcare for out-of-hospital medical services. The PBS reimburses community pharmacies and private hospitals for PBS-listed medicines for all Australian citizens and residents and the subsidy is passed on to the consumer.<sup>

There is limited data to compare these estimates, as it is the first time to our knowledge that a large MH survey in young people has been linked to administrative data. However, studies with linked healthcare data for suicide decedents have reported similar MH service access in the year before death; around 25&#8211;33%.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr10-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For those attending, the average number of sessions with a psychologist (around 6) or a psychiatrist (3&#8211;5) are consistent with guidelines on what might constitute a minimally effective treatment for children or adolescents with mental disorders.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup></p><p>Though marginal, the lower service use observed by those who self-harm or have suicidal ideation compared to those having attempted suicide may reflect that many adolescents and their families wait until a suicide attempt occurs to seek professional help. Likewise, more severe self-reported MDD was seen alongside higher proportion of MH service attendance. Indeed, the First Australian Government&#8217;s National Suicide Prevention Taskforce has identified that a system that relies on health services response at the point of crisis is one that misses many opportunities for suicide prevention and that a refocus toward early identification of distress in addition to clinical interventions is necessary.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-10398562231163415" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup></p><p>Over 75% of the respondents who had displayed self-harm or suicidal behaviour in the 12&#160;months prior to the survey had also seen a GP within the same timeframe, and GP MH specific appointments were the most common MH treatment. This highlights the important role of GPs as gatekeepers for self-harm and suicidal behaviours that are driven by MH and non-MH related factors. Self-reported MDD was not identified during the diagnostic interview in around half the young people and any psychiatric disorder was not identified during the diagnostic interview in 69% of their parents. These findings may highlight social determinants of self-harm and suicidal behaviours may be prominent in this age group and alternative approaches for prevention, outside of the MH treatment framework, are necessary. This shift in focus is supported by the recent advice delivered to the Australian Government by the National Suicide Prevention Taskforce.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Like many studies that have looked at sex differences in service use, we find a greater proportion of females accessed services compared to males. Older adolescents had higher rates of service use in all time periods when compared to younger adolescents, which likely represents increasing severity of underlying MH problems over time and, conversely, delay in recognising and responding to MH problems in younger people.</p><sec id="sec15-10398562231163415"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>There are limitations to this study that should be borne in mind. Firstly, the survey did not identify dates the suicidal behaviours took place and hence it is not possible to identify if the service use occurred before or after the suicidal behaviour. Secondly, due to ethical restraints there was no post-survey data linkage for children aged 12 and 13&#160;years and therefore sample numbers are small and not representative. Thirdly, MBS data does not capture all MH services, and therefore this study represents an under-estimate. Finally, administrational data linked on the individual level is sensitive and obtaining such data is prone to long delays and as a result the data presented here may not reflect current estimates of suicidal behaviour and MH service access in Australia. A recent systematic review would suggest that rates of psychiatric service use have declined in young people since the COVID pandemic.<sup>

</sup> recognise attempted suicide as a marker of severe distress and recommend all individuals attempting suicide should receive MH care. As noted by the Productivity Commission, lack of service use by suicidal individuals is a consistent issue across the lifespan. Conversely, those who self-reported MDD in the study had high MBS-subsidised mental health service use, indicating the need for and importance of accessibility of these services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec25-07334648221143603" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-07334648221143603" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Material - Use of Medicare Benefit Scheme mental health services in young people who experienced self-harm and/or suicidal behaviours: Data from the Young Minds Matter survey</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sj-pdf-1-apy-10.1177_10398562231163415.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>Supplemental Material for Use of Medicare Benefit Scheme mental health services in young people who experienced self-harm and/or suicidal behaviours: Data from the Young Minds Matter survey by Kate M Chitty, Michael Sawyer, Gregory Carter, and David Lawrence in Australasian Psychiatry</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Young Minds Matter was funded by the Australian Government Department of Health.
