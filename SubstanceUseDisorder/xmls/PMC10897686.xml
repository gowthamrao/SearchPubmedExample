It is estimated to affect 185 million people worldwide, including nearly 2.3 million in the UK.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a growing area of interest among researchers and mental health professionals. Typically, it is operationally defined as MDD that has not responded to two lines of oral antidepressants used for a sufficient length of time at adequate doses within a single episode.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It is suggested that 10&#8210;30% of patients with MDD have TRD,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> although rates vary widely.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Irrespective, the burden on individuals and healthcare services is considerable, and capacity within specialist mental health services in the UK is often insufficient to meet demand.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment guidelines for depression all support early initiation of appropriate pharmaceutical and/or psychological (including cognitive&#8211;behavioural) therapies with careful monitoring of outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> After initial treatment, stepwise treatment augmentation and/or specialist interventions (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation) are recommended dependent on clinical response, treatment history and tolerability of potential side-effects,<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> although, again, limited capacity may hinder the full use of options. However, a range of factors, including individual patient characteristics, symptoms, course and combined comorbidities, are thought to contribute to the development of TRD and can pose difficulties in individualising therapy or achieving effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Rush and colleagues, for example, showed that patients who did not respond to two lines of treatment had a greater illness burden (depression chronicity and psychiatric or general medical comorbidities), a decreased likelihood of achieving remission and an increased risk of relapse.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Nevertheless, prescribing of antidepressants has been progressively rising in the UK,<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and they are sometimes favoured over non-pharmacological therapies;<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> moreover, many lines of antidepressants with similar mechanisms of action and efficacy are being used in primary care before referral to secondary services.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Some patients with TRD are reported to have tried up to 12 antidepressants and waited 10 years before they are seen at specialist centres.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>A better understanding of current practices and treatment pathways for TRD is needed in order to improve patient outcomes and lessen overall disease burden. The aim of this study was to use linked real-world primary and secondary healthcare data to evaluate and compare characteristics, care pathways, prescribing patterns and treatment outcomes for patients with MDD and TRD.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This was a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes for patients in north-west London (NWL) with MDD and TRD.

The NWL Data Access Committee considers requests for access and controls how data are accessed and used.

The prescription date was used to ensure capture of any instances in which a code for depression was recorded after antidepressant prescription.</p><p>Data were collected on age, gender, body mass index, ethnicity, geographical location and antidepressant prescriptions. The antidepressants of interest are shown in Supplementary Table 1 available at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.627">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.627</uri>.

In the absence of established outcomes using prescription data, outcomes were defined incorporating extensive clinical input and considering the typical prescription length of 30 days.</p><p>Treatment response was defined as prescription of a single treatment sequence for &#8805;90 days with no change other than dose. Remission was indicated by response of at least 180 days or no antidepressant prescription in the 60 days following the end of a sequence of &#8805;90 days. Relapse was signified by prescription of an antidepressant treatment sequence within 60&#8210;180 days after the end of a previous sequence that had resulted in a response.</p><p>To account for delays in clinical practice (e.g. late start of a prescription, drug out of stock or delay in obtaining a repeat prescription), treatment was classified as follows. Switching was indicated by at least one antidepressant being stopped and at least one replacement drug being introduced within 60&#8210;180 days. Combination prescriptions were those to which an antidepressant was added for at least 45 days when compared with the previous sequence. Pharmaceutical treatment augmentation was signalled by the addition of lithium, an antipsychotic, thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine or an anticonvulsant to a treatment sequence for at least 45 days. Patients classified as having treatment failure were those with lack of treatment response or who switched, started combination therapy or started augmented treatment. Time from diagnosis to referral was defined as the duration (in days) from a depression code being recorded to a code for first referral or contact with secondary mental health services being recorded.</p><p>Contact with secondary mental health services was identified by a Read code for referral in primary care or by a recorded contact with the service to include patients referred via a source other than a primary care practitioner. These included attendance at an accident and emergency department, in-patient or out-patient care by specialist mental health services, and use of home treatment, a crisis intervention team, liaison services or community services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-5"><title>Subgroups</title><p>As well as comparing patients with MDD and those with TRD, we further divided the TRD subgroup into patients who had received two, three or more, or four or more antidepressant prescriptions.

In addition, use of the PHQ-9 was recorded only once or twice per patient; thus, it was not possible to perform a meaningful analysis for this tool. Use of GAD-7 classified most patients as having severe anxiety, with the proportions assigned this classification ranging from 36% of patients in the MDD group to 54% of patients with TRD who had received more than four lines of therapy. Of note, 6614 patients who had contact with secondary mental health services were assessed by GAD-7, but no score was recorded for 2786 (42%). Among the remaining 3828 patients with results, moderate anxiety was most frequent, followed by mild anxiety, no anxiety and severe anxiety (Supplementary Table 6). AUDITC results indicated that around 75% of patients were at low risk of alcohol misuse and only 3&#8210;4% were at high risk in all groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study included a large cohort comprising more than 100&#160;000 patients with MDD and more than 9000 classified as having TRD. Furthermore, access to a comprehensive real-world data-set allowed a median follow-up of 5 years and enabled tracking of long-term treatment patterns and entire care pathways from primary to specialist secondary care. Our findings showed that patients with TRD had substantially higher risks of psychiatric and physical comorbidities, intentional self-harm and suicidal behaviour and poorer response, relapse and remission rates than patients with MDD. These gaps widened with increasing lines of treatment. Furthermore, there were considerable delays to referral and first contact with secondary care services despite the absence of much improved patient outcomes. In fact, only half of patients with TRD had contact with secondary mental health services, with an average time to first contact of around 3.5 years.</p><p>Around 8% of patients in our study were classified as having TRD. This percentage is far lower than the 30% prevalence reported in the STAR*D study<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but much closer to that estimated in the Global Burden of Disease Study and other real-world studies.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The difference is most likely due to the implicit limitations of registry-based studies in accurately capturing all the changes in treatment dynamics but also the actual disparity in the frequency of medication changes (such as switching and augmentation) between routine clinical practice and clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A number of studies have shown that a high proportion of patients are maintained on the same medication for long periods of time following first- and second-line treatment despite lack of adequate response. For example, Wiles et al<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> found that 72% of a cohort of still-depressed patients in primary care remained on the same medication at the same dose for a period of 12 months. In a study by Day et al<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> of 178 patients with TRD, 47% and 51% continued an unsuccessful first or second antidepressant for more than 16 weeks, Furthermore, switching from the first or second trial drug did not occur for at least 1 year for 24% and 27%, respectively.</p><p>Within the National Health Service (NHS), most MDD diagnoses are initially recorded in primary care and treated by GPs, with regional guidelines usually advising a referral to secondary care mental health services and a psychiatrist only for those with complicating factors such as high risk or treatment resistance. Secondary care services provide both urgent and routine community and in-patient care, as well as specialist interventions such as electroconvulsive therapy. Currently, the model recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for treating patients with depression in the UK is a stepped-care approach based on intensity, response and chronicity. For mild depression, psychoeducation, exercise, and talking therapies such as cognitive&#8211;behavioural therapy or counselling are usually offered. For more severe or persistent depression, antidepressants and evidence-based psychological treatments (i.e. cognitive&#8211;behavioural therapy, behavioural activation, interpersonal therapy or psychotherapy) should be considered before being offered high-intensity interventions and combination treatment. In-patient care and electroconvulsive therapy are reserved for emergency situations or complex cases.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, remission was achieved in only 42% of patients in the MDD group and 13% in the TRD group; this was similar to the results reported by Heerlein et al in a 1 year study of 411 patients,<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> where the remission rates were 16.7% at 6 months and 19.2% at 12 months. The relapse rate in our study was 31% in the MDD group and 53% in the TRD group. Likewise, over a 2 year follow-up period, Gillain and colleagues found that of 95 patients who achieved response or remission, 61% relapsed.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The average number of prescriptions per patient was 22 overall, but the number in patients with TRD was twice that in those with MDD. Most antidepressants have an established efficacy in the treatment of depression,<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> with little difference between them in terms of overall outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The effects, however, are achieved by a variety of mechanisms, and patients might benefit from drug combinations.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In our study, of 30 different antidepressants assessed, only four (citalopram, mirtazapine, fluoxetine and sertraline) accounted for 83% of prescriptions for patients with MDD and 71% of prescriptions for those with TRD. This finding is similar to that of Bogowicz et al, who reported that the ten most commonly prescribed antidepressants in 2018 accounted for 96.7% of all antidepressant usage.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In addition, in accordance with previous studies, we found that approximately half of prescriptions were resumptions, whereas rates of switching and combination were low in both groups, and only augmentation occurred more frequently in the TRD group. Heerlein and colleagues, for example, showed that in 60% of patients they assessed, prescriptions had not changed over time despite the low remission rates. These practices, albeit common, are not in line with the UK national guidelines,<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which recommend considering changes in treatment (e.g. dose adjustment, switching, combination, augmentation) if no effect has been observed within 4&#8210;6 weeks.</p><p>Reluctance to adopt more assertive practices may be partly due to a lack of available evidence and clear algorithms for pharmaceutical optimisation.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, several new promising treatments that have been approved specifically for the management of TRD over recent years, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and NMDA-receptor antagonist compounds,<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> or were in the pharmaceutical pipeline,<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> were not available within specialist services at the time of the study. Therefore, treatment still relied mostly on antidepressants and psychological approaches even for patients with TRD. Despite more than a quarter of our TRD subgroup receiving more than four lines of therapy, the average wait for the first contact with secondary mental health services was around 3.5 years. These findings are in line with a recent pan-European study showing that many people with symptoms of depression are not able to access or benefit from usual treatments, are not followed up adequately, and cannot be referred to secondary care or specialist services when required, with only around 19% of people with an MDD diagnosis able to access secondary/psychiatric care.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, it appears pertinent to refocus clinical pathways and improve practice within primary care. Guidelines regarding earlier and easier access to secondary mental health services, more switching, combining and augmentation of treatments, and more specialist treatment need to be highlighted in primary care. Gaynes and colleagues found that if identical care was made available in primary and specialty settings, the same outcomes in terms of responses and remissions could be achieved.<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, staff received support from a clinical research coordinator, the study was small, and patients in the two settings were similar, which is not reflective of all real-world populations. Bogowicz et al suggested that GPs&#8217; knowledge of antidepressant guidelines and attitudes towards legacy prescribing should be explored.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> To this end, further research may be required to understand the barriers to the implementation of clinical depression guidelines within various NHS settings.</p><p>As expected, comorbidity rates were significantly higher in the TRD group compared with the MDD group and grew with increasing number of lines of therapy. Anxiety was the most common psychiatric comorbidity, affecting nearly one-third of all patients. Rates were much higher in the TRD group than in the MDD group, being almost doubled with four or more lines of treatment. Anxiety is a frequent comorbidity in depression and has been associated with both severity of disease and treatment resistance.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Other important comorbidities included asthma, diabetes, and alcohol and substance misuse. Major depression is has been shown to be a notable risk factor for new-onset asthma in adults,<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and there is thought to be shared genetic liability between MDD and atopic diseases.<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The prevalence of diabetes in the study cohort was similar across subgroups and in line with previously reported rates.<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Finally, the co-occurrence of depression with smoking and alcohol/substance misuse, albeit not fully understood, is well established.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> A Swedish study involving nearly 3 million people in the general population indicated that the risk of alcohol and substance misuse was raised 4.5 times in people with generalised anxiety and depression disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although this comorbidity is likely to have been under-recorded overall in the data-set we used, it was significantly more likely to occur in individuals with TRD in our sample.</p><p>Despite the overall considerable burden of MDD &#8211; and, particularly, TRD &#8211; our study emphasises the fact that treatment gaps between current and best practice and divergence from evidence-based international recommendations remain substantial. Notwithstanding some level of regional variations in care provision and treatment guidelines, this appears to be a consistent challenge across most parts of the UK and Europe. For example, contemporary international standards and clinical depression guidelines highlight the value of altering the course of therapy, combining therapies and/or considering timely specialist interventions, but clinical practice remains suboptimal. The recently published Value of Treatment mission study from the European Brain Council put forward a set of recommendations to address and minimise gaps relating to increased capacity, creation of more specialist mood disorders services, bespoke training programmes for GPs to achieve mental health expertise, and reforms to ensure early referrals and easy access to secondary services and specialist treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study had considerable strengths, including the use of longitudinal data obtained from a large deidentified data-set via the Discover platform.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> WSIC is one of the largest data warehouses in Europe, and data linkage allows tracking of treatment dynamics, use of different parts of the healthcare system, comorbidities and medications. An additional advantage was that it was possible to assess TRD patients by number of lines of therapy. The point prevalence of MDD at the time of data extraction was 4375 per 100&#160;000 patients, and that of TRD was 392 per 100&#160;000 patients in NWL. Therefore, our sample size was highly representative.</p><p>The study, however, had several limitations. Real-world data are subject to coding and reporting errors and gaps, and capture was limited to NHS data. Therefore, records might have been missing for a variety of reasons. First, patients who received non-NHS private or residential care or were in groups vulnerable to mental health issues, such as prisoners, illegal immigrants and the homeless, could not be captured or were likely to be poorly captured. Second, some important aspects of the overall management of depression, such as suicidal behaviours and repeat testing of severity with PHQ-9 or other validated scales, patients who remain on an ineffective treatment without reporting lack of response (i.e. not reaching our threshold for TRD) and use of psychological therapies were not captured separately or well represented in the data. Third, prescriptions in secondary care are likely to be underrepresented, as they are recorded only if they incur high costs. However, this is unlikely to have greatly biased the results, as most prescribing for MDD occurs in the primary care setting. Fourth, the subgroup of patients in contact with secondary mental health services could not generally be assessed by diagnosis. The findings for this subgroup, however, tended to fall between those for MDD and TRD, potentially indicating that they were quite strongly driven by patients with TRD. Fifth, we were unable to capture data on specialist treatments available exclusively in secondary care, such as electroconvulsive therapy. Sixth, without strong data on the use of instruments, such as the PHQ-9, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery&#8211;&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale, we had to derive response, remission and relapse statuses through prescription data. As study-specific algorithms were developed to identify outcomes of interest, definitions used may have varied between studies using the same data. For example, definitions using different cut-off time points would have resulted in different outcomes. Furthermore, prescription data did not capture whether the prescription had been dispensed or consumed, a limitation of most electronic medical record databases. For the purposes of this study, it was assumed that all prescriptions written were dispensed on the same day and consumed according to the prescribing information. Improved recording of scores might be helpful in the evaluation of clinical outcomes in the future. Finally, the particular study design did not allow assessment of causality, and it was only possible to explore correlations. Therefore, cautious interpretation of findings is advisable. Adding to this, the two groups were quite dissimilar (including the large difference in sample size between the MDD and TRD cohorts), posing some degree of challenge when trying to make comparisons, although statistical tests may partly account for this. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test in our inferential statistical analysis. A propensity score-matching method might have allowed for better comparison; however, it would not cover the entire population and thus would not capture all resource usage. Given the nature of this study, we decided that reflecting overall patterns would be more useful. Matching of groups might be possible as the Discover data-set grows in size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>This real-world population-based study allowed exploration of care received in primary and secondary NHS services in a large patient cohort and over a substantial period of time. Patients with MDD are receiving high numbers of prescriptions in primary care with few changes over several years despite low response and remission rates and without contact with secondary mental health services. Outcomes are even worse for patients with TRD, for whom the number of prescriptions per patient are at least doubled while the remission rate is decreased by around a third. The burden is also substantially higher for the TRD group regarding comorbidities such as anxiety, asthma and alcohol/substance misuse, as well as self-harm and suicidal behaviours. Furthermore, our findings suggest that long delays are not conducive to secondary care improving outcomes. Hence, along with optimising use of existing evidence on the use of available treatments and lessening variation from guidelines, the development of stratified care pathways ensuring timely access to new therapies and specialist services where needed might improve patient outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In addition, reaching consensus on definitions and improved recording of routine data would be a benefit in future real-world studies to provide insight not available from clinical trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec4"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="sm01" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Pappa et al. supplementary material</title><p>Pappa et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="S2056472423006270sup001.pdf" id="d66e1336" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rachel Ashton for medical writing assistance, which was supported by Jansen Cilag Ltd.</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="nts1"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplementary material is available online at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.627">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.627</uri>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec-das1"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from Imperial College Health Partners, but restrictions apply to availability as they were used under approval for the current study and are not publicly available.
