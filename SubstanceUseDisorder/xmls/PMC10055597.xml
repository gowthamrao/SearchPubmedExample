id="ABS1"><p id="P1">Buprenorphine is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder and a critical tool for addressing the worsening U.S. overdose crisis. However, multiple barriers to treatment - including stringent federal regulations - have historically made this medication hard to reach for many who need it. In 2020, under the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, federal regulators substantially changed access to buprenorphine by allowing prescribers to initiate patients on buprenorphine via telehealth without first evaluating them in person. As the Public Health Emergency is set to expire in May of 2023, Congress and federal agencies can leverage extensive evidence from studies conducted during the wake of the pandemic to make evidence-based decisions on the regulation of buprenorphine going forward. To aid policy makers, this review synthesizes and interprets peer-reviewed research on the effect of buprenorphine flexibilities on uptake and implementation of telehealth, and its impact on OUD patient and prescriber experiences, access to treatment and health outcomes. Overall, our review finds that many prescribers and patients took advantage of telehealth, including the audio-only option, with a wide range of benefits and few downsides. As a result, federal regulators&#8212;including agencies and Congress&#8212;should continue non-restricted use of telehealth for buprenorphine initiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>buprenorphine</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>opioid use disorder</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>policy translation</kwd><kwd>overdose</kwd><kwd>federal regulations</kwd><kwd>telehealth</kwd><kwd>telemedicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">COVID-19 struck the United States (U.S.) during an overdose crisis that has claimed over one million lives.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Limited access to highly effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) has long hampered their success as a countermeasure to overdose deaths.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist that can be prescribed by non-specialty providers, is a particularly advantageous MOUD, given its safety profile and its strong protection against overdose risk.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite increased availability of buprenorphine over the past two decades,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> a vast amount of unmet treatment need persists.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">One reason for this gap is that buprenorphine is highly regulated.

Following the recent removal of the federal X-waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing, questions about the mode of delivery become even more central to expansion efforts for buprenorphine treatment going forward.<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> Until the pandemic, DEA regulations<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> made it unlawful for prescribers to use telehealth to initiate patients on buprenorphine. A major finding of our review is that once regulators cleared the way for telehealth initiation, many prescribers and patients took advantage of this new mode of care delivery, including some who might find in-office care to be out of reach for any number of factors. Telehealth visits rapidly increased across various care settings for initiating and continuing buprenorphine treatment. As a result, allowing telehealth likely strongly contributed to relatively stable levels of buprenorphine usage after the pandemic began.</p><p id="P29">In addition to being feasible, initiation of buprenorphine via telehealth was found to be successful for a variety of patients and generally associated with better retention in care. While the evidence on adverse outcomes was limited, it suggests that telehealth was associated with few-to-no-overdoses, which is consistent with protective effects and known safety profile of buprenorphine.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Since the completion of our review, a recently published study found that despite increasing overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no increase in the proportion of overdose deaths involving buprenorphine.<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Patient experiences were overwhelmingly positive for many reasons including decreased burden, less stigmatized interactions, increased access and freedom, and reduced risks of exposure to COVID-19. However, such experiences varied across patients, as some did not prefer telehealth to in-person care. This dynamic was generally similar among prescribers, with some enthusiastic about telehealth and hopeful that the flexibilities would continue. Others acknowledged challenges that made telehealth less preferred for them. The preponderance of studies in this review supports the idea that patients and prescribers generally agree that telehealth flexibilities should remain, even while acknowledging that telehealth should not go so far as to replace in-person care for everyone.</p><p id="P30">The future of telehealth use for buprenorphine is currently in question as the Biden administration announced that the COVID-19 PHE will expire on May 11, 2023. Policymakers should consider the evidence of support for and success of the buprenorphine telehealth experience and act to officially retain telehealth as a mode of initiation for buprenorphine. So far, SAMHSA has proposed a rule to continue to make telehealth available in the OTP setting,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but for all other prescribers, DEA has proposed to extend only a portion of its pandemic flexibility for buprenorphine initiation.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The new DEA rule proposes that while prescribers may initiate buprenorphine treatment for 30 days, the patient must make an in-person visit to continue treatment. This is despite prior legal research showing that the DEA possesses ample regulatory authority to keep all of the current regulations, without limits on duration of telehealth.<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup></p><p id="P31">Findings in our review highlight that a lack of clarity around telehealth regulations may create apprehension to provide these services.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> DEA&#8217;s proposed requirement for an in-person visit<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> may lead to uncertainties around prescribing, limiting uptake. In addition, many studies pointed to the benefits of reaching otherwise hard-to-engage populations via telehealth,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> making it likely that a 30-day mandate for an in-person visit will prevent some at-risk patients from engaging or continuing in care. Given these findings, the DEA should consider removing in-person requirements altogether. Congress could also legislate to make the full pandemic telehealth flexibilities permanent by making audio-only prescribing for buprenorphine clearly acceptable under the Ryan Haight Act. Recent legislation that extended Medicare coverage for telehealth and eliminated the X-waiver demonstrates that there may be a political appetite for such changes that improve access to MOUD.<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">Even after making these telehealth flexibilities permanent, at least two other policy questions remain. For both, we emphasize that additional access could save lives and suggest a policy approach prioritizing access over other precautionary concerns. Our findings also imply that a treatment landscape without a realistic telehealth option likely means some patients, and perhaps those at greatest risk, will not receive treatment.</p><p id="P33">First, policymakers should be neutral between video and audio-only telehealth for buprenorphine initiation. DEA&#8217;s proposed rule permits audio-only telehealth if the patient does not agree to video, but requires the prescriber to document the patient&#8217;s reason for declining video. This implies that the prescriber&#8217;s preference is video, when in fact that prescriber&#8217;s judgment might be that an audio-only connection is medically acceptable. In reviewed studies, some prescribers preferred video to audio-only modes of communication, but also recognized the access trade-offs of requiring video, a sign of the complexity of this policy choice. Importantly, our review did not identify substantive evidence that audio-only is less safe or effective than video telehealth. Therefore, as attitudes towards telehealth evolve, it may be wise for policymakers to allow for true flexibility rather than putting a thumb on the scale for video.</p><p id="P34">Second, the federal government should consider how it might support implementation and adoption of telehealth for buprenorphine initiation. Technical assistance or grant support could help prescribers adapt to new technologies offering secure, HIPAA-compliant, and high-quality telehealth services. With this support, prescribers may consider other practices that may be needed to make telehealth a practical option, such as the frequency of urine screening or shifting other support services online.<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Our review found that some prescribers, such as older prescribers, those in solo practices, and prescribers treating smaller numbers of OUD patients, lagged behind their counterparts regarding telehealth uptake. Further research is needed to determine if policy interventions, such as training, financial incentives, and more favorable reimbursement rates for telehealth visits,<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> are cost-effective in encouraging telehealth uptake among prescribers. This will be particularly important in expanding these practices to prescribers who were previously not X-waivered but may now consider prescribing buprenorphine. Of course, 100% telehealth uptake is not necessary for a telehealth policy option to improve and save lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P35">First, our search was confined to peer-reviewed studies published before November 15, 2022, and may have missed more recent studies. Second, the synthesis and interpretation of the evidence were limited by small sample sizes, variation in settings, time periods assessed, outcomes, and methods used to answer each research question, including solely descriptive approaches. As a result, many of the associations described are not causal. Third, social desirability bias may be present in responses to self-report surveys and interviews. Fourth, the multiple social and structural changes in the pandemic make it challenging to attribute outcomes directly to telehealth regulatory changes. Outcomes should therefore be interpreted in context.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P36">Under pressure from the pandemic, federal regulators allowed prescribers to initiate patients on buprenorphine via telehealth without first evaluating them in person. Our review finds that many prescribers and patients took advantage of the telehealth option, with a wide range of benefits and few downsides. As a result, federal regulators&#8212;including agencies and Congress&#8212;should continue the use of telehealth for buprenorphine initiation. Unfortunately, the PHE is set to expire soon and DEA&#8217;s proposed rule fails to carry its full pandemic flexibility forward. Given the significant enthusiasm for telehealth and limited-to-no evidence of bad outcomes, DEA should broaden its proposal. If it does not, Congress should act to ensure continuous and low-barrier access to this lifesaving treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="media-1.pdf" id="d64e938" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments and Funding</title><p id="P37">This work was supported by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts.
