The COVID-19 pandemic and the federal and provincial public health emergency orders implemented in response to the pandemic affected the cannabis consumption patterns in a multitude of ways. During the pandemic, provinces and territories have ordered full lockdowns and other restrictive measures on businesses to help curtail the spread of the virus (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). Businesses have also had to adapt to the changing environment. Physical retail outlets took steps to reduce in-person interactions and close contact primarily by implementing physical distancing measures within stores, increasing sanitation measures, reducing operating hours, and where possible providing curbside pickup or online sales (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures implemented to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV&#8208;2 virus has had direct and indirect consequences on cannabis consumption, many of which are preliminary and continue to be researched (Statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2021</xref>; Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). In Canada, the sale of cannabis falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction and during the initial pandemic lockdowns, most jurisdictions either declared or treated the non-medical retail sale of cannabis as an essential service (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). Retail sales of cannabis, for example, increased across Canada except for Prince Edward Island after the initial waves of the pandemic (Myran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). One poll conducted earlier in the pandemic showed that cannabis consumption in Canada remained stable (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>), while a second poll indicated that the frequency and quantity of cannabis use increased by over 30% among those who consumed cannabis (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). A Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) study in 2022 reported that purchases from licensed retailers had been increasing as the two most common avenues of purchase in 2020 were from legal physical and online stores (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). Moreover, the consumption method has been shifting slightly from smoking to edible products as they become more available through legal channels (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">The impact of the pandemic on cannabis consumption in Canada and, specifically, whether health- and socioeconomic-related changes and stresses have impacted patterns of use, is of particular interest as we enter the fifth year of cannabis legalization in Canada&#8213;a time and opportunity for policy adjustment. The objective of this scoping review was to describe the patterns of consumption and cannabis-related health and safety considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. A scoping review was conducted to systematically map the research in this area, identify gaps in existing knowledge, and make recommendations for future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par17">Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic with rapidly emerging evidence, a scoping review was deemed to be the most appropriate method (Levac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>). We adopted the five-stage scoping review methodology developed by Arksey and O&#8217;Malley: (1) identify the research question; (2) identify the relevant studies; (3) indicate the inclusion and exclusion criteria; (4) chart the data; and (5) collate, summarize, and report the results. Arksey and O&#8217;Malley define a scoping review as &#8220;a technique to &#8216;map&#8217; relevant literature in the field of interest &#8230; [which] tends to address broader topics where many different study designs might be applicable &#8230;&#8221; (Arksey and O&#8217;Malley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines on scoping reviews were also adopted to guide our methodology and align with current reporting standards in evidence synthesis (Peters et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>). Reporting was also informed by the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">This review was initiated with the question &#8220;What impact has the COVID-19 pandemic had on cannabis consumption and health and safety issues related to cannabis in Canada?&#8221; The search strategies were developed in consultation with a librarian and through team discussion.

However, Leatherdale et al.

Two of the included studies reported findings on the health and safety impacts are detailed here and in Table<xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>. The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) reported that more Canadians received substance-related hospital care during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the previous year.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">In this scoping review, we identified 21 records that addressed the impact of the pandemic on patterns of use and cannabis-related health and safety in Canada. Our findings suggest that the impact of the pandemic on cannabis consumption in Canada is more complex than simplistic assumptions of increase or decrease. The association appears to be based on the characteristics of the consumers such as age, gender, type of user (occasional/frequent), reasons for use, and accentuated health impacts.</p><p id="Par53">Our findings match those of other countries and portray a mixed picture with respect to cannabis use during the pandemic (Farhoudian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Turna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>; Manthey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>; Vanderbruggen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>; van Laar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>; European <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). An online survey of 21 European countries found that the pattern of change in cannabis consumption across Europe during the pandemic was not clear; however, on average, consumers reported an increase in use (Manthey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>). Similarly, a global survey found that approximately 42% of participating countries reported that cannabis consumption increased, whereas 26% and 22% reported a decrease and no change in cannabis use pattern, respectively (Farhoudian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Interestingly, a survey in Belgium found there were no significant changes in cannabis consumption noted in the period before and during the COVID-19 lockdown suggesting social isolation did not influence cannabis consumption (Vanderbruggen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">Similar to findings in Canada, cannabis consumption patterns in the Netherlands may have changed more among regular consumers during the pandemic (van Laar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). In addition, data available from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) suggests that some occasional users may have stopped using or reduced their cannabis use during the lockdown period, while those who had more frequent or intensive patterns of use may have increased their consumption (European <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). These findings are similar to patterns seen in Canada (Imtiaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">Motives that drove the increased consumption of cannabis during the pandemic appear to be similar around the globe. Top reasons reported for consuming cannabis more during the pandemic included boredom and loneliness (Vanderbruggen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>; van Laar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). However, an interesting difference was noted when comparing healthcare practitioners in Italy, Brazil, and the USA to those in Canada where Canadian practitioners reported increasing their cannabis consumption during the pandemic to cope with stress and anxiety (Turna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Gender-specific considerations influencing cannabis consumption are important to consider for prevention and public education as the pandemic evolves. While the CCSA&#8217;s 2021 report &#8220;Differences in Cannabis Perceptions among Canadian Adolescent Boys and Girls&#8217;&#8217; reported that boys and young men reportedly use cannabis more frequently and heavily than girls and young women (Goodman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>), our scoping review found that in the context of COVID-19, cannabis use among female youth increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to male youth. Furthermore, there was a greater reduction in the expected escalation of cannabis use among males compared to females, suggesting cannabis consumption among males may be more socially driven than among females (Dumas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Leatherdale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>). As the effects of the pandemic extend beyond the disease itself, it has become imperative to understand the short and long-term consequences of the pandemic and understand the impacts for specific segments of the population, including variation between genders. Informing mitigation strategies with &#8203;&#8203;a gender-specific understanding of patterns of use is important.</p><p id="Par57">Smoking cannabis continued to be the most common method of consumption at the end of 2020. Evidence supports the concern that cannabis smoke can negatively affect heart and lung health (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). The extent to which cannabis smoke impacts respiratory and immune health in humans is not well-known and further studies are needed to confirm these relationships (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). This is concerning in the context of the pandemic as smoking cannabis has been linked to increased risk for COVID-19 complications and related death (Canadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). In light of the ongoing pandemic, behaviors that might put an individual&#8217;s health at risk should be carefully considered. Furthermore, given smoking continues to be the most common method of consumption, it highlights a need for evidence-informed cannabis education, and in particular, with regards to Canada&#8217;s lower-risk cannabis use guidelines (Fischer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Despite the effect of above factors on cannabis consumption during the pandemic, there are methodological issues that needs to be considered for interpretation and that are not explored in this study. The heterogeneity of findings could be due to difference in study designs and qualities. Due to the short timeframe between the pandemic and this study, follow-up length and baseline cannabis use could impact the consumption patterns that are captures in studies reviewed in this manuscript.</p><p id="Par59">This scoping review identified several implications for future research and practice. Frequent cannabis consumers who are adolescents, young adults, mothers, and frontline workers require more attention for further research. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to control it have caused a range of mental health issues leading to increased consumption to address those issues; however, this review did not find evidence of the benefits from consuming cannabis. Understanding the cycle of mental health and substance use is important to inform decisions and policies to facilitate greater availability of, and accessibility to, mental health and substance use services as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and for future public health crises. In particular, further research is needed to understand the changes in cannabis consumption during the pandemic and how these changes have impacted health and safety that will be relevant post-pandemic. It would also be interesting to investigate the role of therapeutic cannabis use among regular cannabis users, during an unprecedented pandemic.</p><p id="Par60">This scoping review includes a number of limitations. Many of the included studies were conducted relatively close to the beginning of the pandemic, therefore, routines may have not been established and the possible full impact of the pandemic not captured. Many of the studies reviewed used self-reported cannabis use and self-perceived changes during the pandemic. Subjectivity can be both a strength and a limitation, depending on different epistemological perspectives. In addition, the review is dependent on information on the review question being available and since the pandemic is ongoing there may be gaps in evidence. It is also possible that relevant sources of information may have been omitted. Finally, as is the case for all scoping reviews, no rating of quality or level of evidence is provided; therefore, practice recommendations cannot be graded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par61">As we learn to live with COVID-19, its impact on and its relations with cannabis in Canada is an issue of importance. This scoping review synthesized rapidly growing knowledge on the relationship between the pandemic and cannabis consumption in Canada. This review suggested that the impact of the pandemic on cannabis consumption in Canada is more complex than simplistic assumptions of increase or decrease and it continues to be difficult to measure. The association depends on the characteristics of the consumers such as age, gender, reasons for increased and decreased use, and method of consumption. As the COVID-19 continues to evolve, high-quality evidence is needed to inform how public health-related policies and practices on cannabis can protect vulnerable groups such as young adults and frequent consumers, and future research should focus on better understanding considerations for mental health among cannabis consumers.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CCSA</term><def><p id="Par6">Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCHS</term><def><p id="Par7">Canadian Community Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIHI</term><def><p id="Par8">Canadian Institute for Health Information</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPSS</term><def><p id="Par9">Canadian Perspectives Survey Series</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHCC</term><def><p id="Par10">Mental Health Commission of Canada</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHRC</term><def><p id="Par11">Mental Health Research Canada</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCS</term><def><p id="Par12">National Cannabis Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMCDDA</term><def><p id="Par13">European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#8217; contributions</title><p>MN, KN, JD, LB, and SP designed the research.
