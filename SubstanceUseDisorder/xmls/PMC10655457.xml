We characterised the extent to which vaping is recorded in primary care EHRs in the UK, on a population level.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We performed descriptive analysis of Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), primary care electronic health records of 25% of the UK population (~&#8201;16&#160;million patients). Patients aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;18 years whose vaping status was recorded using medical codes between 2006 and 2022 were identified. We reported the frequency of vaping codes; their distribution by patient age, gender, and ethnicity; trends in vaping recording over time (including interrupted time series analyses); and transitions in patient smoking status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Seven medical codes indicated current or former vaping, from 150,114 patients. When their vaping status was first recorded, mean patient age was 50.2 years (standard deviation: 15.0), 52.4% were female, and 82.1% were White. Of those recorded as currently vaping, almost all (98.9%) had records of their prior smoking status: 55.0% had been smoking, 38.3% had stopped smoking, 5.6% had never smoked. Of those who were smoking prior to being recorded as vaping, more than a year after the vaping record, over a third (34.2%) were still smoking, under a quarter (23.7%) quit smoking, 1.7% received a &#8216;never smoked&#8217; status, and there was no smoking status for 40.4%. The &#8216;e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury&#8217; (EVALI) outbreak was significantly associated with a declining trend in new records of current vaping between September 2019 and March 2020; and an immediate significant increase in new records of former vaping, followed by a declining trend.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Few patients are being asked about vaping. Most who vape had smoked, and many quit smoking after starting vaping. To enable electronic health records to provide stronger evidence on health effects, we recommend improved completeness, accuracy and consistency.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-023-17200-7.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking</kwd><kwd>Tobacco</kwd><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Substance use</kwd><kwd>Vaping product</kwd><kwd>Nicotine</kwd><kwd>e-cigarette</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Family practice</kwd><kwd>Family medicine</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Electronic health records</kwd><kwd>CPRD</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>Economic and Social Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LISS DTP es/p000703/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>United Kingdom Prevention Research Partnership</institution></funding-source><award-id>MR/S037519/1</award-id><award-id>MR/S037519/1</award-id><award-id>MR/S037519/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100023232</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research Applied Research Collaboration South London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Smoking is a leading preventable cause of illness and premature death in the United Kingdom (UK) and worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Evidence suggests that using nicotine vaping products (NVPs, or e-cigarettes) is less harmful than smoking tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and NVPs improve smoking cessation likelihood compared to nicotine replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, due to uncertainty about the long-term health effects of NVPs and concerns around youth uptake, policy and guidelines around NVPs vary internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some clinical guidelines recommend that health professionals encourage the use of NVPs as another option for smoking cessation on a par with medicinally licensed pharmacotherapies and behavioural support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For example,&#160;the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidelines recommend that adults who smoke have access to NVPs alongside other smoking cessation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the UK, NVPs are regulated as consumer products and NVPs are available on the open market to those aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NVPs are the most popular smoking cessation aid in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 9.1% of adults in Great Britain regularly used NVPs in 2023 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Monitoring NVP use prevalence and uptake can establish the long-term benefits and harms of NVP use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although population surveys can generate NVP use prevalence estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], these are often cross-sectional, under-sample vulnerable populations, have short-term follow-up, or do not enquire extensively about health outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) could help identify long-term health effects of NVP use, pending NVP use data completeness.</p><p id="Par8">Currently, studies about how health professionals are documenting NVP use in EHRs are limited (Supplementary Box <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Studies from the United States (US), found low vaping screening rates in EHRs, ranging from: 14.3% in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to 34.8% in 2021&#8211;2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; 0% in 11&#8211;17-year-olds in 2016&#8211;2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and 16% in 18&#8211;35-year-olds who had never smoked in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. US studies found that patients with documented (current) vaping were more likely to be male, aged 18&#8211;44 years, and White [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the prevalence of US patients who have vaping documentation is still low (&lt;&#8201;1%), it is increasing. First-time incidence of vaping documentation increased from 0.1 to 95 per 100,000 patients from 2006 to 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the prevalence of vaping documentation (including &#8216;never vaping&#8217;) increased from 0.0032 to 0.46% in progress notes between 2009 and 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similar to population surveys, the rate of current/former vaping in non-smoking populations is relatively low in EHRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; patients are more likely to be screened for vaping if they have indicated that they smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], hence there are high proportions of current and former smoking among those who have vaping documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two US studies used EHRs (2012&#8211;2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 2018&#8211;2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) to examine transitions between current vaping and smoking status, finding that smoking cessation was more likely among those who received current vaping documentation compared to those not vaping.</p><p id="Par9">To our knowledge, there have been no studies specifically investigating health professionals&#8217; documentation of vaping in the UK. In the UK, general practitioners (GPs) are required to record standardised information on clinical conditions, such as smoking status. Although a 2018 Royal College of Physicians (UK) consultation recommended NVP use recording in EHRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], GPs are not currently incentivised to record this via the pay-for-performance scheme (Quality and Outcomes Framework, QOF). UK QOF guidelines (2018/19&#8211;2022/23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) recommend that NVP users &#8220;who have never smoked or given up smoking should be classified as non-smokers or ex-smokers respectively&#8221;, which may lead to under-recording of NVP use in EHRs. Other UK guidance (2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) recommended that health professionals ask about NVP use routinely. This guidance was in response to an outbreak of severe lung injuries largely confined to the US: &#8216;e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury&#8217; (EVALI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. EVALI was purported to be associated with conventional nicotine vaping, but the US CDC concluded that vaping products which contained tetrahydrocannabinol and Vitamin E acetate were linked to most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. EVALI was identified in July 2019, followed by a peak in cases and US news coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] in September 2019, then a steady decline through early 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">It is not known to what extent vaping is recorded in UK EHRs.

Vaping code incidence increased from September 2013. The EVALI outbreak in the US (and peak media coverage in September 2019) was significantly associated with a reduction in new records of current vaping, manifested as a declining trend over a period of seven months (September 2019 to March 2020); additionally, there was an immediate increase in new records of former vaping, followed by a declining trend over the subsequent seven-month period. When patients received their first vaping code, mean age was 50.2 years, 52.4% were female, and&#160;82.1% were White. When receiving the first vaping code, the majority of patients were either smoking or had quit smoking in the past, and &lt;&#8201;2% were recorded as having never smoked. Of those recorded as currently vaping, 98.9% had records of their previous smoking status, and 55.0% had records of their &gt;&#8201;12 months smoking status. Over a year after being recorded as vaping, 34.2% of people who were smoking prior to being recorded as vaping were still smoking, 23.7% quit smoking, 1.7% received a &#8216;never smoked&#8217; status, and there was no smoking status for 40.4%.</p><p id="Par57">Similar to US studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we found that vaping documentation incidence in UK EHRs is low, but has increased over time. We found no medical codes indicating never vaping. There was a rising trend in new current and former vaping records over time, this may be attributed to an increase in: awareness of vaping or the relevant vaping codes among GPs; GPs screening the vaping status of their patients; or patients volunteering their vaping status or having questions about their vaping status to GPs.</p><p id="Par58">The changes associated with the EVALI outbreak could be attributable to increasing numbers of patients quitting vaping due to negative media coverage of potential health harms or GPs paying greater attention to asking and recording about (former) vaping. To our knowledge, no other study has examined the effect of EVALI on vaping documentation in EHRs.</p><p id="Par59">The reduction in monthly number of new current and vaping records following implementation of the first national COVID-19 lockdown could be attributable to reduced access to GP appointments.</p><p id="Par60">Unlike US studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], where patients with vaping documentation were more likely to be younger, the mean age of patients in our sample when they first received a vaping code was 50 years. A 2022 Great Britain vaping survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that 11% of 18&#8211;44-year-olds, and 10% of 45&#8211;55-year-olds used NVPs, indicating that a relatively high proportion of middle-aged people use NVPs. Our finding may reflect the NVP prevalence in Great Britain, that we excluded patients&#8201;&lt;&#8201;18 years, and that older people may be more likely to visit a health professional, and hence have more opportunities to receive a vaping code.</p><p id="Par61">The gender distribution in our sample of patients who have ever received a vaping medical code was similar to the 2021 England and Wales Census [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (51.0% female). However, Great Britain vaping surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that a higher proportion of males use NVPs compared to females, similar to two US studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Similar to US studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we found that most patients who have ever received a vaping code were White (82.1%), reflecting UK population ethnicity proportions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, our other ethnicity categories were confounded by 12.6% being &#8216;unknown&#8217; (similar to a previous CPRD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]).</p><p id="Par63">Our findings are similar to previous studies where a high proportion of those with vaping documentation were currently smoking (57% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], 52.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) or formerly smoked (35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]).</p><p id="Par64">Two US studies found that among those who smoked and vaped, 20.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and 23.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported quitting smoking during the following year. Our finding was similar: &gt;&#160;12 months after receiving a current vaping code, 23.7% of people who were smoking before they received the vaping code were indicated to have quit smoking. Additionally, Young-Wolff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found that among those who quit smoking before vaping, 14.0% of those currently vaping reported returning to smoking in the following year; we found that 11.9% of people who had quit smoking before they received the vaping code had returned to smoking after 12 months. Lastly, we found that among those who have never smoked before they received the vaping code, 7.7% had initiated smoking after &gt;&#8201;12 months after receiving the current vaping code, compared with 8.0% in the prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, we cannot make inferences about the effectiveness of NVP use on smoking cessation from our analyses because ~&#8201;45% of patients did not have a&#8201;&gt;&#8201;12-month follow-up smoking status record, vaping documentation is likely to be missing not at random, and we did not control for any confounding factors.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Strengths &amp; limitations</title><p id="Par65">Our study has several strengths.&#160;This is the first study to comprehensively describe and characterise NVP use recording in UK EHRs. We used data from CPRD which covers 25% of the UK population. Our study covers 16 years from when NVPs appeared in England in 2006 to March 2022. We found that CPRD vaping record data were sufficiently sensitive to be able to detect statistically significant effects of events (EVALI, COVID-19 lockdown) on vaping record incidence.</p><p id="Par66">Our study also has limitations. We could not analyse free-text comments that GPs can log, as these are not available for research purposes. While CPRD data have been shown to be largely representative of the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], CPRD may be less representative for specific subgroups, such as people who vape. Vaping status and smoking status may not be accurately captured in EHRs, e.g., some patients were recorded to be smoking or have quit smoking before receiving a vaping code, but they received a &#8216;never smoked&#8217; record&#8201;&gt;&#8201;12 months after. In our smoking status transition analyses, the time between the vaping code consultation date and the subsequent smoking status consultation date varied between patients because we wanted to capture the longest possible smoking cessation outcome for each patient. Given that smoking is a relapsing and remitting condition, the variable duration of the follow-up record may limit the interpretation of our results, however, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to mitigate this. The interpretation of the smoking status transitions is limited regarding the smoking cessation rate following receiving a vaping code because a high proportion of patients (44.8%, 68,219/152,277) did not have a subsequent smoking status recording.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Implications</title><p id="Par67">Vaping documentation rates in primary care UK EHRs are very low. Increased completeness, accuracy and consistency of vaping status recording would further increase the value of these data. Refining existing medical codes would enable health professionals to unambiguously record current vaping, former vaping or never vaping. Financially incentivising health professionals has increased smoking status recording [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; in the UK, a QOF indicator could be introduced for recording vaping status. In clinical practice, vaping screening could be assigned to specific clinical team members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or integrated into existing processes, such as alongside routine smoking screening during annual health checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Improving the completeness of EHR vaping status data would result in longitudinal population-level data for vaping surveillance which is linkable to other electronic health information. This could be employed to investigate long-term health outcomes of vaping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], evidence on which is currently lacking. We found that nearly all first-time incidence of vaping records had a previous smoking status recording, and more than half had a subsequent smoking status recording. Future studies could employ matched control samples to investigate if there are any differences between longer-term smoking cessation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or health outcomes between patients who vape and do not vape. Also, studies using EHRs could investigate how long patients use NVPs, and transitions between current and former vaping and vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par69">Using 2006&#8211;2022 CPRD UK primary care data, we found that vaping code incidence increased from September 2013 but vaping documentation rates were overall very low. When receiving the first vaping code, the majority of patients were either smoking or had quit smoking in the past. Of those who were smoking prior to being recorded as currently vaping, more than a year after the vaping record, over a third were still smoking, under a quarter quit smoking, and there was no follow-up smoking status record for 40%. Increased completeness, accuracy and consistency of vaping status recording would further increase the value of longitudinal population-level EHR data, enabling the investigation of the long-term health effects of vaping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
