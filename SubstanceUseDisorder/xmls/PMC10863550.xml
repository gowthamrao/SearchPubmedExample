TAF was promoted as having a better safety profile for renal toxicity compared to the older PrEP regimen approved in 2012 containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) [<xref rid="ofad695-B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref>]. The Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Alafenamide Fixed-Dose Combination Once Daily for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in Men and Transgender Women Who Have Sex With Men and Are At Risk of HIV-1 Infection (DISCOVER) trial showed that those assigned to TAF exhibited more favorable long-term renal function trajectories (ie, lower reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] over time) compared to those on TDF [<xref rid="ofad695-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pooled analysis of data from 12 PrEP trials also found increased adverse renal events (eg, mild asymptomatic elevation in eGFR) in people on TDF versus placebo [<xref rid="ofad695-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. TAF is hypothesized to be safer for renal function as it leads to lower plasma levels of tenofovir, translating to lower nephrotoxicity [<xref rid="ofad695-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Currently, FDA labels show that TAF, but not TDF, can be used by people who have renal clearance &lt;60&#8197;mL/minute, which is indicative of kidney dysfunction [<xref rid="ofad695-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Some people who initiated PrEP with TDF have started switching to TAF, citing convenience and safety reasons such as small tablet size, side effects, and vulnerability to renal function decline due to preexisting conditions [<xref rid="ofad695-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Data from people with HIV (PWH) support switching for renal safety reasons. Pooled analysis of trials in people with HIV showed that switching from TDF to TAF-based regimens led to positive changes in renal biomarkers (eg, creatinine clearance, urinary biomarkers) compared to staying on TDF [<xref rid="ofad695-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, a cohort study found that PWH who switched from TDF to TAF experienced improvement in eGFR [<xref rid="ofad695-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Results from DISCOVER, which compared TDF to TAF for PrEP, also supports switching. They found that TDF-experienced individuals assigned to the TAF arm (essentially, leading to switching) had higher eGFR on 48-week follow-up than TDF-experienced individuals assigned to the TDF arm, as eGFR increased in the TAF arm while remaining stable in the TDF arm [<xref rid="ofad695-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Results from the open-label phase of DISCOVER also showed that PrEP users switching from TDF to TAF exhibited increase in eGFR (relative to baseline), while those who stayed on TAF had a relative decline [<xref rid="ofad695-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the DISCOVER study population does not necessarily reflect the demographic characteristics of people on PrEP in the US [<xref rid="ofad695-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and it would be important to confirm findings in nontrial settings. In this retrospective cohort study using electronic health records (EHRs), we assessed changes in eGFR after switch from TDF to TAF in a matched cohort study where we compare TDF-to-TAF switchers to those who stayed on TDF.</p><sec id="ofad695-s0"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="ofad695-s0.1"><title>Study Design</title><p>This is a retrospective cohort study using EHR from Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). KPSC is an integrated healthcare delivery system providing comprehensive health services to approximately 4.8 million members. KPSC membership is diverse and widely representative of the communities in the Southern California service area, comprising &gt;20% of Southern California's population [<xref rid="ofad695-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Members&#8217; receipt of outpatient, inpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy services are tracked in KPSC's EHR system. Care received out of KPSC facilities is captured through billing claims.</p></sec><sec id="ofad695-s0.2"><title>Study Population</title><p>Adults &#8805;18 years of age who initiated PrEP at KPSC with TDF during 2014 to 2021 were identified for the underlying study cohort. Individuals were considered eligible for regimen switching and entered the cohort on their switch-eligible date. This is the date when they have used TDF for PrEP for at least 6 months (based on pills received) or 1 October 2019, whichever came later. Individuals were excluded if they disenrolled or initiated TAF with &lt;6 months of TDF use. We also excluded individuals who had chronic kidney disease or abnormal laboratory findings (eg, grade 3 or 4 proteinuria) at time of TDF initiation (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> for full details).</p><p>This underlying cohort was then used to identify matched TDF-TAF switchers and TDF-only nonswitchers via time-varying propensity score (TV-PS) matching. Details on matching and calculation of the assigned switch date are described in the statistical analysis section.</p></sec><sec id="ofad695-s0.3"><title>Exposure, Outcome, and Follow-up</title><p>The exposure of interest is switching from TDF to TAF after cohort entry and was based on pharmacy filled (sold) data. Switchers were compared to those who stayed on TDF (ie, nonswitchers).</p><p>The outcome is creatinine-based eGFR (henceforth, &#8220;eGFR&#8221;) after switching to TAF up to 18 months of follow-up or study end date (30 June 2022). All eGFRs were recalculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2021 creatinine equation [<xref rid="ofad695-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The index date for follow-up started on the recorded switch date for switchers and the assigned switch date for nonswitchers.</p></sec><sec id="ofad695-s0.4"><title>Covariates</title><p>Covariates included age at TDF initiation, sex, race and ethnicity (Asian [non-Hispanic], Black [non-Hispanic], Hispanic, White [non-Hispanic], other), insurance type (commercial, Medicaid/care, others), ever smoking, cardiometabolic comorbidities (diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension; time-varying), and body weight (time-varying). Comorbidities were identified using combinations of diagnosis codes, medication, and laboratory data (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> for definitions). Missing covariates were handled using single imputation with random forests for computation efficiency [<xref rid="ofad695-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ofad695-s0.5"><title>Statistical Analysis: Matching</title><p>TV-PS matching was performed to identify matched switchers and nonswitchers following the approach described by Zhang et al [<xref rid="ofad695-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This achieves some covariate balance but more importantly, allowed the identification of an index date to start follow-up in nonswitchers. The index date for switchers would be their actual switch date.</p><p>The TV-PS model was an extended Cox model that included time-invariant (age, race and ethnicity, male, ever smoking, insurance, year of switch eligibility met, weight, and eGFR at switch-eligible date) and time-varying (diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension status) covariates. An iterative process (<xref rid="ofad695-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) was then used to perform 1:4 matching without replacement. Since matching is done in the order of switch dates, individuals were eligible to be selected as a matched nonswitcher prior to their TDF-TAF switch date.</p><fig position="float" id="ofad695-F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Creation of matched sample.

Therefore, the index date of switchers and nonswitchers would not necessarily be the same calendar date, but both groups will have similar distribution of intervals between the switch eligibility date and the follow-up index date.</p></sec><sec id="ofad695-s0.6"><title>Statistical Analysis: Outcome Analysis</title><p>Using the matched cohort, we first calculated descriptive statistics for clinical-demographic variables to compare switchers to matched nonswitchers and, separately, compared the matched cohort to the original group of eligible individuals. We also plotted eGFR over time from the follow-up index date to month 18 post&#8211;index date.</p><p>We used Bayesian linear mixed effects models to examine eGFR under the counterfactual scenario that TDF-to-TAF switchers did not switch their regimen. In other words, we estimated &#8220;What would have happened to the eGFR if the switchers in the data did not switch?&#8221; given the switchers&#8217; covariate distribution. This is equivalent to estimating average treatment effect among the treated [<xref rid="ofad695-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We calculated differences in eGFR between switching and nonswitching scenarios at a priori selected time points after switching (months 0.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18). In this main analysis, individuals with no follow-up eGFR data after the (assigned) switch date were further excluded.</p><p>The Bayesian model included spline terms for time and were adjusted for age, sex, insurance, race and ethnicity, ever smoking, eGFR at index date, and weight at index date. Random effects for person and pair and interaction terms (eg, time &#215; switch status) were also included. Bayesian models produce 95% credible intervals (CrIs) instead of confidence intervals. The 95% CrI is interpreted as &#8220;there is a 95% probability that the true effect estimate would lie within the interval, given the evidence provided by the observed data&#8221; [<xref rid="ofad695-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We calculated 2 additional measures to aid interpretation: probability of direction (PDI) and region of practical equivalence (ROPE). PDI tells us the proportion of the (posterior) estimate lies in the direction of positive difference (ie, switching is favorable) in eGFR [<xref rid="ofad695-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ROPE tells us the percentage of the posterior draws that lie in the region of &#8220;practically no effect or difference,&#8221; which we set at &#177;2 eGFR units [<xref rid="ofad695-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We performed 3 sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated modeling but limited it to eGFR during the time that individuals were adherent with their exposure at index date (eg, nonswitchers remained on TDF). This partially handles the issue of nonswitchers including people who were observed to switch later during follow-up. The second and third sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the issue of missing eGFR. In the second sensitivity analysis, we used a weighted Bayesian model incorporating inverse probability missingness weights [<xref rid="ofad695-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Stabilized weights were calculated from logistic regression models on the probability of being included in the complete case analysis. In the third sensitivity analysis, missing outcomes and covariates were imputed using multiple imputation with chained equations and the models were run using separate linear regression models (1 for each time point) instead of using a mixed effects model.</p><p>All analyses were conducted in R/RStudio version 4.3.0.

Latest included switch date was in May 2022. Seven of the initial 125 switchers were selected as a matched nonswitcher prior to their switch and were treated as nonswitchers for the rest of the analysis.

The difference in the short-term eGFR trajectory was not statistically or clinically significant based on credible intervals and ROPE results. Our results do not support that switching from TDF to TAF would improve eGFR in our sample of insured patients using PrEP. This contrasts with the findings of DISCOVER where TDF-experienced individuals assigned to the TAF arm (ie, switched to TAF) had significantly higher eGFR by week 48 compared to those assigned to TDF [<xref rid="ofad695-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The main proposed renal protective mechanism of TAF relates to the lower tenofovir plasma levels, which lead to lower injury of the proximal tubule cells [<xref rid="ofad695-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Lower tenofovir plasma levels due to switching may have allowed recovery of epithelial cells and improvements in eGFR as observed in DISCOVER [<xref rid="ofad695-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The null results in our analysis could be due to differences in our population, such as age and eGFR at index dates, suggesting the possibility of heterogenous impact of switching by these variables. This highlights the value of examining outcomes when the target patient population differs from the trial population, especially if the differences influence the outcome [<xref rid="ofad695-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There could be individuals who have already had irreversible damage from TDF use such that switching would have little impact, echoing observations in TDF discontinuation studies in PWH [<xref rid="ofad695-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The null findings could also be due to unmeasured confounding. For example, we were not able to fully account for cumulative TDF exposure prior to switch or for PrEP adherence or off-label intermittent use of PrEP [<xref rid="ofad695-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, tenofovir from TAF remains excreted in the urine so the proximal tubule remains exposed, albeit at lower levels [<xref rid="ofad695-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Our article also serves as a practical demonstration on how to study the impact of switching treatments using real-world data through matching [<xref rid="ofad695-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A common approach would be to compare outcomes of switchers before and after switching [<xref rid="ofad695-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this approach lacks a control group. Another approach would be to compare ever switchers to never switchers [<xref rid="ofad695-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The first issue with this is that it can create groups that cannot be made comparable at baseline even with covariate adjustment. Never switchers likely have some indication that prevent them from using the alternative strategy (also known as positivity violation in epidemiology) [<xref rid="ofad695-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the setting of survival analysis, comparing ever and never switchers can introduce immortal time bias, as outcomes prior to switching are always counted in the never switcher group (ie, ever switchers are made immune to the outcome prior to switching) [<xref rid="ofad695-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For our analysis, we focused on continuous outcomes so the main challenge is identifying the appropriate index date to start follow-up. Importantly, even if we just compare never to ever switchers, we will still not have an appropriate index date for follow-up. While one could theoretically assign a random date to start follow-up among never switchers, this does not fully address immortal time bias. We overcome these challenges by using time-varying propensity scores combined with outcome modeling [<xref rid="ofad695-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The approach allowed us to select a contemporary control without conditioning on future events. Alternative approaches include sequential nested trials and marginal structural models, but these methods work better in settings with larger samples and more regular timing of assessments [<xref rid="ofad695-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, missing data, especially clinical or laboratory data, was an issue. We used single imputation for some missing covariate data for computation efficiency. However, studies have shown that multiple imputation is the gold standard [<xref rid="ofad695-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Relatedly, we limited our analysis to eGFR, as the more specific measures of renal tubular proteinuria (eg, urine &#946;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin to creatinine ratio, retinol-binding protein to creatinine ratio) cannot be obtained from our EHR data [<xref rid="ofad695-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While measures for microalbuminuria (eg, albumin-to-creatinine ratio) are also available, these are not routinely measured on follow-up for PrEP in our system. Second, our TV-PS model does not fully account for important TV variables that affect decision to switch like eGFR or lipids due to missingness. Instead, we incorporated these variables in the outcome model. However, this leads to our results being interpretable only as average treatment effect among the treated [<xref rid="ofad695-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We cannot make inference on the counterfactual for controls (ie, what would happen to eGFR of nonswitchers had they switched to TAF?). The approach we adapted also does not consider replacement of potential matches, which requires modified analytic procedures [<xref rid="ofad695-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ofad695-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Alternative techniques can be used to overcome these issues, such as a sequence of target trials, but that requires a large sample of switchers and, ideally, more regularly measured time-varying covariates [<xref rid="ofad695-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Third, our study was also limited to short follow-up since TAF was approved for PrEP use in 2019. Relatedly, the reversed direction at month 18 could be due to data sparsity since we observed that only around 28% have observed eGFR data by month 18. Fourth, we should ideally incorporate time-varying censoring weights to account for adherence [<xref rid="ofad695-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but it was not feasible to implement these more complicated models given available structured data in the EHR. Instead, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where we censored eGFR after nonadherence. We also assumed that individuals were following a once-daily PrEP regimen and not taking it intermittently or &#8220;on demand.&#8221; Fifth, we focused on renal function measured by eGFR rather than clinical events. Finally, since our data came from an integrated health system in Southern California, generalizability to other healthcare settings or uninsured or underinsured patient populations may be limited.</p><p>In summary, we found that switching from TDF to TAF was associated with a nonsignificant increase in eGFR among people on PrEP. Confirmatory studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up or randomized switch or crossover trials are needed to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>ofad695_Supplementary_Data</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ofad695_supplementary_data.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="ofad695-s3"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
