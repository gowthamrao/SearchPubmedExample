Differences in the diagnosis and management of chronic HBV in Hispanics might exist due to the lower awareness of risk. We aim to examine racial/ethnic disparities in the diagnosis, presentation, and immediate management of chronic HBV in a diverse safety net system enriched for Hispanics.</p><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a large urban safety-net hospital system, we retrospectively identified patients with chronic HBV by serological data and categorized them into mutually exclusive self-identified racial/ethnic groups: Hispanics, Asians, Blacks, and Whites. We then examined differences in screening, disease phenotype and severity, follow-up testing, and referral by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 1063 patients, 302 (28%) were Hispanics, 569 (54%) Asians, 161 (15%) Blacks, and 31 (3%) Whites. More Hispanics (30%) were screened in the acute setting (defined as inpatient or emergency department encounters) than Asians (13%), Blacks (17%), or Whites (23%) (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01). Hispanics also had lower rates of follow-up testing after HBV diagnosis than Asians including HBeAg status (43% vs. 60%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01) and HBV DNA levels (42% vs. 58%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01) and lower rates of linkage to specialty care (32% vs. 55%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01). Among those with available testing, however, the presence of immune-active chronic HBV was infrequent and similar across racial/ethnic groups. 25% of Hispanics had cirrhosis at initial presentation, proportionally higher than other groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our results underscore the importance of raising chronic HBV awareness and increasing both screening and linkage to care among Hispanic immigrants in addition to the existing risk groups, with the goal of mitigating downstream liver-related complications.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

Other barriers that lead to a delay in or even lack of diagnoses include poor public understanding of HBV and its long-term sequelae, patients opting out of screening, difficulty reaching populations at higher risk for HBV infection (ie, immigrants, persons who inject drugs, and the undomiciled), the asymptomatic nature of chronic HBV until late stage, and poor provider understanding of HBV treatment indications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition to underdiagnosis, downstream completion of HBV metrics are also lacking; up to half of patients who are eligible for HBV treatment do not receive treatment in the first year following diagnosis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Delays in diagnosis and treatment places an estimated 15%&#8211;25% of undiagnosed chronic HBV patients at risk of premature death from cirrhosis, HCC, or liver failure necessitating liver transplant.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>While there are some data on the management and outcomes of HBV infection among immigrants in the US, primarily Asian-born,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there is very little on the epidemiology and outcomes of HBV infection in Hispanics. This is an important knowledge gap as Hispanic immigrants are currently the largest racial/ethnic group of foreign-born in the US,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and are projected to comprise ~22.8% of the total US population by 2035. Importantly, Hispanics, compared with Whites, have a 50% greater death rate due to chronic liver disease,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and are projected to have the highest rate of liver cancer by 2030.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The sharp increase in HCC in Hispanics has been largely attributed to higher rates of NAFLD and high-risk alcohol use<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; however, the presence of other etiologies of liver disease, such as chronic HBV, may be relevant, particularly among the foreign-born.</p><p>We hypothesized that delays in screening and subsequent HBV management may be more frequent among Hispanics than other racial groups, especially Asians, due to the lower recognition of Hispanics as a risk group. Herein, we compared chronic HBV presentation and initial management of Hispanics with other racial/ethnic groups in a large, urban safety net population predominantly of Hispanic immigrants, with a focus on clinical setting of screening and subsequent downstream testing and linkage to care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case selection</title><p>We performed a retrospective analysis of persons with chronic HBV infection within the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC DHS) safety net health care system between December 29, 2016 and December 31, 2019. The LAC DHS system is an integrated health care system of 26 health centers and 4 acute-care hospitals, caring for more 750,000 unique patients yearly. Nationally, it is the second largest municipal health system, serving the most populous county in the US. More than 80% of patients served have public insurance or are uninsured.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology subspecialty clinics serve as the referral clinic for primary care providers within the DHS system and received referrals from other federally qualified health centers and community health centers who provide care for publicly insured or uninsured patients.</p><p>HBV diagnosis was defined as a positive HBsAg or detectable hepatitis B DNA (HBV DNA) (due to possibility of HBsAg testing outside of our system). Index date or time of diagnosis was considered the date of first positive test. Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a diagrammatic explanation of cohort selection. All cases 18 years of age and older were included. Patients with an ALT &gt;250&#160;U/L or reactive HBV Core IgM at the time of diagnosis were excluded from the study to avoid inclusion of patients with acute HBV. Those with missing or insufficient data to assign ethnicity were excluded. Patients with positive HBV testing before December 29, 2016 or were on HBV treatment before positive testing within the study time period were excluded.

All data were aligned to entry into the cohort (date of initial HBsAg/HBV DNA testing). Patient demographics were obtained, including age, gender, insurance, country of birth, and preferred language. Insurance was categorized as Medicare, Medicaid, Subsidized (federally or state subsidized), Commercial, Self-Pay (no insurance or out of network for insurance), and Other (none of the above).</p><p>We obtained the following baseline clinical data: medical comorbidities by ICD-10 coding (Supplemental Table 1, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A190" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A190</ext-link>) and closest laboratory data to date of diagnosis including platelet count, AST, ALT, HBeAg/Ab testing, alpha-fetoprotein, HBV DNA, HIV, and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) testing.

Cirrhosis and HCC definitions and all ICD-10 diagnosis codes were limited to 365 days before and after initial diagnosis date to reflect patient&#8217;s disease severity at initial presentation. To determine the baseline HBV phenotype, we first identified patients who had the minimum laboratory tests (ie, HBeAg, HBV DNA, and ALT) needed to determine the baseline phenotype, then categorized as immune-tolerant, immune-active, inactive carrier, or indeterminate as defined by AASLD guidelines (Supplemental Table 1, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A190" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A190</ext-link>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> We also collected data on abdominal imaging performed within 365 days of initial HBV diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening and management covariates</title><p>To examine differences in the identification and management of patients with chronic HBV, we obtained additional details related to patient encounter and clinic visits. First, we identified the ordering provider and their location (categorized as inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department) of initial diagnostic testing, and if applicable, the outpatient department where testing was ordered (categorized as primary care, GI or hepatology, obstetrics, or other specialty clinics).</p><p>Among those diagnosed in the outpatient setting (n=858) or those diagnosed in the acute care setting with outpatient follow-up in our system (n=205), we examined rates of referral and linkage to subspecialty care for chronic HBV. Linkage to care could have occurred as (1) direct scheduling into the subspecialty clinic (more common after an acute care visit) or (2) as an outpatient GI/hepatology referral through the DHS E-consult referral system. The E-consult system allows primary care physicians to directly message specialist reviewers about potential patient referrals through an online portal; specialists then triage the request to the hepatology clinic or back to the primary care. Patients who are triaged back to primary care are provided with standardized guidance on further workup and monitoring. Based on internal E-consult guidance documents, patients who meet treatment criteria have cirrhosis or have a first-degree family member with HCC are recommended for a subspecialty appointment. Patients, whose referrals were accepted are then contacted by schedulers to schedule a subspecialty appointment within the time frame recommended by the specialist reviewer. In this study, we collected the frequency of direct scheduling, E-consult referral (requested and accepted), and dates of initial E-consult request and first liver clinic appointment to determine the time elapsed between initial referral and initial appointment as a proxy for timely care.</p><p>To examine treatment patterns within our population, we first identified the proportion eligible for HBV treatment based on AASLD guidelines (presence of cirrhosis, HIV coinfection, or immune-active disease).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Finally, we identified the number of patients who had at least 2 GI appointments and were prescribed HBV treatment, and proportion who were not prescribed treatment despite potential eligibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics by race/ethnicity were reported as median with interquartile ranges or mean with SD and compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Among those diagnosed in the outpatient setting and those diagnosed in the acute-care setting with outpatient follow-up (n=906), linkage to specialty care also differed by race/ethnicity. Overall, all other racial/ethnic groups had lower rates of linkage to care with GI/hepatology clinic as compared with Asians (32% of Hispanics, 20% of Blacks, 32% of Whites vs. 55% of Asians). In total, 28% were directly scheduled with a subspecialty clinic (ranging 9%&#8211;39% by race/ethnicity), while 34% of all patients had a provider request for GI/hepatology subspecialty care sent through the E-consult system. E-consult referral rates were lower for Hispanics compared with Asians (33% vs. 46%), but similar rates of E-consult acceptance (47% vs. 51%) and slightly lower rates of completion of initial clinic appointment (78% vs. 89%). Among those with at least 2 subspecialty follow-up appointments, 10% of Hispanics versus 33% of Asians were prescribed HBV treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="F4" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>HBV care cascade by ethnicity group. *Patients with at least 2 outpatient gastroenterology (GI)/hepatology appointments.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="hc9-7-e0081-g005.jpg"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Appropriate screening and management for chronic HBV is crucial to modifying the risk of liver-related complications. In this study, we examined the role of race/ethnicity in disease presentation and initial management of chronic HBV in a safety net setting, with a specific focus on Hispanics as there is little research on HBV among the large and growing Hispanic demographic in the US. In fact, due to the high proportion of Hispanic immigrants in our safety net catchment area, Hispanics were the second largest race/ethnicity group in our study with HBV. Within this study, we identified notable disparities in initial presentation and management for Hispanics, including more screening performed in the inpatient or emergency room setting, lower proportion with minimum testing to determine the HBV phenotype, lower rates of subspecialty referral, and higher rates of advanced liver disease.</p><p>There were clear differences in the physical location of initial HBV screening/diagnosis across racial/ethnic groups. Hispanics had higher rates of diagnosis in inpatient or emergency room settings when compared with Asians, suggesting that Hispanics are less likely to receive risk-based screening for HBV in the outpatient setting as per AASLD and US Preventative Services Taskforce guidelines,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and are instead screened in an acute-care setting presumably guided by symptoms, examination findings, or abnormal laboratory or imaging results. This finding could be partially explained by differential utilization of health care, including how likely a patient is to establish care with a primary care provider and regularly attend outpatient visits and phlebotomy lab draws. Studies have shown that Hispanics are less likely to get preventative care due to lack of health insurance (related to immigration status, employers), financial burdens, previous poor medical provider interactions, and the desire to not be given an official diagnosis for an illness.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our study found that although Hispanics had the highest rates of cirrhosis among all ethnicity groups, they had the lowest rates of outpatient follow-up (at primary care or gastroenterology clinics) after initial positive HBsAg or HBV DNA test in our system (77%) and E-consult referrals (33%). As expected, patients diagnosed with HBV in acute-care settings (inpatient or emergency settings) have lower rates of outpatient follow-up appointment attendance than for patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. While perhaps some patients hospitalized in our healthcare system may establish care outside our system, we suspect that these rates are low and that education around HBV in the acute-care setting is inadequate, such that most of these patients remain unaware of their infection upon discharge. Low overall outpatient follow-up rates underscore the point that while increasing HBV screening overall is extremely important, we also must ensure that patients diagnosed with HBV are appropriately linked to further care.</p><p>It is also plausible that poor provider familiarity with risk-based HBV screening guidelines and HBV prevalence in Latin American countries plays a role in the lower frequency of outpatient screening in Hispanics compared with Asians. HBV prevalence fluctuates greatly between the countries of Central America, from 0.20% in Mexico and Guatemala, 0.55% in Nicaragua, 0.62% in Costa Rica, 4.71% in Belize, and 1.68% in Panama.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Even within Mexico specifically, one study found that Mexico City had higher rates of HBV infection than other regions,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> while another study found that residents in Southern Mexico had higher rates of HBV exposure than those in Central Mexico.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The high frequency of representation of Mexico as a country of origin of the Hispanics in this study (~50%) suggests that current screening guidelines that do not include Mexico as a country with&#8805;2% HBV prevalence may be leading to underdiagnosis. One way to overcome this barrier would be a recommendation for one-time universal HBV screening for all US adults (or at least all foreign-born), identical to the universal screening guidelines for HIV and HCV, to ultimately simplify screening guidelines and ensure broader diagnosis coverage for HBV. A recent Markov modeling study has shown that the implementation of universal HBV screening in the US would not only prevent 23,000 liver-related deaths, but also be a cost-savings of 596 million dollars,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> further demonstrating that timely diagnosis of HBV by increasing HBV screening is not only potentially lifesaving, but also a judicious use of health care resources. Recent release of universal HBV vaccination recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> has paved the way for the evaluation of a universal screening recommendation&#8212;which if implemented could have substantial public health impact.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>When examining the severity of liver disease at the time of HBV diagnosis, we found that Hispanics had higher rates of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis by ICD-10 coding and fibrosis scores within the first year of diagnosis compared with all other races. These findings suggest that Hispanics may present with more advanced liver disease upon initial HBV diagnosis than other racial/ethnic groups. There are several possible explanations. The first is that the phenotype of HBV is more aggressive in Hispanics, but this is less likely as viral parameters such as HBV DNA and proportion with immune-active HBV were similar by race/ethnicity in our cohort; prior studies have also suggested a more benign disease course.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> More likely, we believe the more advanced fibrosis in Hispanics with HBV may be a result of higher rates of coexisting liver disease such as fatty liver disease and alcohol-associated liver disease in this population, as both metabolic comorbidities and alcohol use disorder/alcohol-associated liver disease, in particular, were more common among Hispanics in this cohort, especially when compared with Asians. Hispanics have high rates of mortality due to liver disease and are expected to have the highest rates of HCC in the US by 2030,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> largely due to the preponderance of NAFLD found in Hispanics, typically linked to diabetes and obesity.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, given the potential heightened risk of cofactors for fibrosis progression in Hispanics specifically, it is even more important to identify potential modifiable risk factors, such as HBV, as early as possible to avert liver-related complications.</p><p>In a US-based cross-sectional study on the rates of treatment initiation in patients aware of their chronic hepatitis B diagnosis, 28% of patients were initiated on treatment.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Similarly, in our study, only 26% study participants were ever started on treatment for chronic HBV during the study period, with Asians initiating treatment nearly twice as frequently as Hispanics among eligible. The determination of HBV phenotype and treatment eligibility was based on a single set of labs, a notable limitation of this study as patients with chronic HBV need continued monitoring and reassessment for treatment eligibility. In this study, follow-up testing for HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HIV were suboptimal, which points toward lapses in HBV care, but also a potential barrier to receiving treatment. The minimum sufficient set of testing to determine HBV phenotype within 1 year of diagnosis, including HBeAg status, was only available in 17% of Hispanics (vs. 34% of Asians), which may be directly correlated with lower subspecialty referral and visits. Thus, the inequities in receiving referrals and secondary screening tests may lead to a smaller proportion of patients appearing eligible for treatment.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
</p><p>In addition, overall screening for coinfections were inadequate; of the Hispanic population, only 62% received HIV testing, 78% received HCV testing, and 4% received HDV testing. Unlike HCV and HIV coinfection testing which is recommended for all patients with HBV infection, the 2018 AASLD HBV guidance currently recommend risk-based HDV testing, which undoubtedly contributes to the low rates of HDV testing observed in this study.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Low testing for HDV overall is consistent with other studies from other health systems.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> However, guidance from other organizations such as the 2017 European Association for the Study of Liver diseases Hepatitis B guidelines recommend testing for HDV in all patients with positive HBsAg.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> True HDV prevalence, especially in the US is currently unclear given the low screening rates, which makes it difficult to determine the true impact of HDV infection has on chronic HBV patients&#8217; treatment eligibility and outcomes. Lack of complete testing for HBV phenotype and coinfections ultimately hinders an accurate determination of treatment eligibility and is an area of postdiagnosis management that needs to be optimized in clinical practice.</p><p>Our study highlights the need for provider-level education and interventions around HBV diagnosis and management targeted to foreign-born Hispanics. For example, one US health system first prioritized accurate recording of patients&#8217; birthplaces, then developed an electronic health record alert to prompt medical providers to screen patients born in countries with &gt;2% HBV endemicity who had not yet received HBV screening.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> A Mayo Clinic quality improvement study increased HBV testing in at-risk immigrants by reminder emails to primary care providers 1 week before patient appointments to discuss HBV screening at patient&#8217;s upcoming appointment.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Interventions increasing linkage to care amongst patient diagnosed with HBV in emergency department settings might be implemented in safety net systems serving populations with high HBV prevalence and a patient population that may not regularly engage in outpatient primary care.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
</p><p>This is an administrative dataset, thus biases related to misclassification due to coding or lack of validated codes may be present. In particular, we could not independently stage liver disease with standard tools (i.e. elastrography) due to unavailability in our healthcare system, so surrogate measures such as ICD-10 coding or fibrosis estimate scores were utilized. Our data on abdominal imaging was limited to the imaging type and date of imaging; therefore, we cannot comment on the reasons why patients received abdominal imaging. ICD-10 codes as surrogate for a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis have been used in other administrative studies to describe the burden of liver disease and comorbid conditions.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The small sample size of Whites and Blacks in this study makes it more likely that estimates in these smaller groups, especially Whites, were biased or inaccurate. As our system is a referral base for community clinics and federally qualified health centers, we may be underestimating the proportion receiving appropriate testing and follow-up if performed in primary care outside of our system, but we are likely accurately capturing linkage to specialty care. Further, due to resource constraints, only patients that will likely require treatment are recommended for specialty follow-up, so rates of linkage to specialty care within this system should not be directly compared with other systems with less restrictive referral policies. While our study population is not generalizable to the entire US population and potentially other geographic regions, it is the ideal population in which to study HBV in Hispanic immigrants, who often access care in safety net facilities and are a vulnerable population that has been poorly characterized in the literature to date.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate notable differences in initial diagnosis, linkage to care, and management for Hispanics with chronic HBV in a safety net healthcare system, including lower frequency of appropriate viral testing and subspecialty referrals. These deficiencies are important as we simultaneously found a higher rate of liver-related complications among Hispanics at the time of their HBV diagnosis. Our findings underscore the importance of scaling up HBV screening in less well-recognized risk groups to mitigate the potential negative outcomes related to delays in the identification of chronic HBV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><fig id="s001" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="hc9-7-e0081-s001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></fig><fig id="s002" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="hc9-7-e0081-s002.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></fig></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge Ms. Laura Thompson (University of Southern California) for assistance with supplemental figures and Mr. Christopher Wong (University of Southern California) for assistance with data collection.
