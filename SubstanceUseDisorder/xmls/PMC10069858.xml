amongst all age groups with a multifaceted impact on individuals and society.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In the United States, the treatment cost for a DRF repair in the pediatric population was estimated to be $2 billion per year, and in patients over 65 years of age, Medicare paid over $340 million for DRF associated payments with numbers expected to increase if commercial and government health insurances were taken into account.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Certainly a frequently painful injury, a substantial portion of these expenditures and detrimental impact are the perioperative care and rehabilitation, including pain management.</p><p>With the growing opioid epidemic, hand surgeons are recommended to screen patients for risk factors that may contribute to morbidity or mortality related to opioid consumption in the setting of narcotic prescribing and administration.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These risk factors consist of psychiatric illnesses, current nicotine usage, history of substance abuse disorders, and socioeconomic risk factors such as employment status, self-pay, and Medicaid-insurance status.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, there is no mention of cannabis use and its effects on postoperative opioid consumption despite the growing reported usage of cannabis.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The prevalence of patients using cannabis has increased, with approximately 18% of adults in the United States reporting use in the past 30 days.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Despite the growing reported usage of cannabis, there is minimal data known in regard to its effects in perioperative opioid management, especially hand surgery.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Prior studies have examined the effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocarbon (THC) on study populations including neoplasms of the breast, lung, colon, and cervix, and found that those who had inadequate pain management on opioids alone demonstrated an analgesic effect with the addition of cannabis.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Cannabinoid derivatives, both synthetic and plant derived, have been studied by several groups to determine their effect in pain management and opioid consumption in syndromes of acute and chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare patients with an active diagnosis of cannabis use and those without on subacute postoperative pain management, specifically regarding prescription opioid volume filled after operative repair of distal radius fractures within a national insurance claims database. Operative treatment of DRF was selected to standardize the cohorts from an acute pain event. We also investigated the role of mental health diagnoses on prescription opioid filling patterns in these two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Database</title><p>Data were obtained from PearlDiver (PearlDiver, Inc, Colorado Springs, Colo.), a commercially available database, which was queried to access deidentified patient data from 2010 to 2020. PearlDiver is a research tool that represents 122 million patients nationwide and across all payer types, including Medicaid, Medicare, and private commercial insurers. The database stores patient data using unique patient identifier codes allowing for longitudinal tracking, while maintaining Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliancy. Institutional review board approval for this study was not required, as the data studied is publicly available and is completely deidentified; thus, it is exempt from IRB approval. Anonymous patient information, including demographics, prescriptions, procedures, and comorbidities, was accessed using codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth (ICD-9) and tenth (ICD-10) revision; Current Procedural Terminology; and National Drug Codes.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Cohorts</title><p>A retrospective review of patients undergoing surgical treatment for a DRF, specifically an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), was conducted using the following CPT codes: 25607 (ORIF extraarticular), 25608 (ORIF intraarticular, two fragments), or 25609 (ORIF intraarticular, three or more fragments). To maximize homogeneity of the study population in terms of procedural site specific and incisional pain, only patients with an open repair were included, and closed reduction and percutaneous methods alone were excluded. Patients were included in the study if they had longitudinal health care 3 months before and 3 months after the surgical date. Only patients with active cannabis use diagnosis within 6 months before surgery were included in the study.</p><p>The study population was then categorized into two groups based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes: those with a history of cannabis use (case population: ICD-9 of 304.3, 305.2 and ICD-10 of F12.1, F12.2, or F12.9) and those without (control population). To reduce any potential confounding variables, the case population was matched to a control group in a 1:3 ratio by age; sex; region in the United States; Elixhauser Comorbidity Index; and the following comorbidities: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, tobacco use disorder, alcohol abuse, and obesity status. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index is a risk-adjusent model used to predict postoperative morbidity based on several comorbidities relevant to this study, including obesity, alcohol/tobacco abuse, and depression.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The comorbidities were chosen as they were associated with increased opioid demand from patients after surgery. Propensity score matching was done to achieve a standardized mean difference below 0.2 after matching, which has been found to result in optimal estimation of treatment effects and eliminate at least 98% of bias in a study.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A ratio of 1:3 case to control was chosen to increase the overall sample size of the control group and subsequently, the power of the study, while minimizing bias.</p><p>Rates of filled opioid prescriptions by patients after DRF surgery were reviewed and presented as morphine milligram equivalents (MME) based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Patients with two or more opioid prescription refills within 30 days before surgery were defined as chronic opioid users by the CDC<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Those with one opioid prescription refill within 30 days preoperation were not included in the chronic opioid use group, as they could have received these medications during their initial consult visit for DRF evaluation. Several mental health comorbidities that may affect filled opioid prescription patterns were included in the analysis: alcohol use disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and tobacco use disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Patient demographics and outcomes were analyzed using chi-squared test for categorical data and two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test for continuous data to compare the case and control populations. Welch two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test was performed to determine a significant difference in filled opioid prescriptions and average days per prescription between patients with a history of cannabis use and those without. Logistic regression was utilized to determine risk factors contributing to chronic opioid use as defined by the CDC. All statistical analyses were performed using the Bellwether software within the PearlDiver research tool with the significance level set at a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 150,233 patients underwent surgical treatment for DRF during the study period, from 2010 to 2020. Of the initial group, 557 patients had an ICD diagnosis of cannabis use within 6 months before surgery and will be referred to as the &#8220;case population.&#8221; Patients who did not have this diagnosis will be referred to as the &#8220;control population.&#8221; The case population had a relatively equal distribution of cannabis users between the ages of 20 and 64, whereas the control population had skewed distribution with the majority of patients aged 50 years and older. To account for this difference and eliminate any potential bias, age was matched using propensity scores with a standard mean difference of less than 0.2. The mean age of patients was 43.29 years old in the case population and 44.98 years old in the control population after propensity matching. Rates of diagnoses for mental health disorders and substance use were higher in the case population. The comprehensive demographic data are shown in Supplemental Digital Content 1. (<bold>See Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1,</bold> which displays the patient demographics of patients with a diagnosis of cannabis use and those without undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472</ext-link>.)</p><p>The case population had a greater proportion of patients who did not fill any prescription opioids before surgery compared with the control group (38% versus 33%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.204). However, the rates of prescription refills before and after surgery were congruent in both the case and control populations and did not show significant differences (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). For patients who filled an opioid prescription after surgery, average MME per prescription were significantly reduced in the case population compared with the control (352.26 versus 480.61 MME/prescription, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.005). In those who filled a second postoperative opioid prescription, the case population filled a reduced amount of MME per prescription compared with their control counterparts; however, this difference was not significant (488.77 versus 624.2 MME/prescription, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.189). Supplemental Digital Contents 2 and 3 provide details on patient&#8217;s pre- and postoperative opioid prescription patterns. (<bold>See Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2,</bold> which displays a comparison of opioid prescription filled, stratified by number of prescription filled. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472</ext-link>.)

Factors associated with increased opioid prescription refills included preoperative chronic opioid use [OR, 4.80 (95% CI, 3.94&#8211;5.87)]. In the subgroup of patients with an active ICD code for cannabis use, the only factor associated with increased opioid prescription refills was preoperative chronic opioid use [OR, 5.02 (95% CI, 3.48&#8211;7.3)]. Mental health diagnoses and substance use disorders were not associated with increased refills of prescription opioids for the case population. In the subgroup analysis for the control population, a history of preoperative chronic opioid use [OR, 4.76 (95% CI, 3.78&#8211;6.01)] and depression [OR, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.01&#8211;1.85)] were associated with an increased risk of filling more opioid prescriptions postoperatively. The odds ratio and confidence intervals of these findings are shown in Supplemental Digital Content 4. (<bold>See Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content 4,</bold> which displays a logistic regression evaluating independent risk factors for prolonged opioid refills following open reduction and internal fixation of DRF. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/PRSGO/C472</ext-link>.)</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Understanding the patterns and risk factors associated with increased opioid abuse is a necessary step to safe perioperative management. This study evaluated patterns of opioid prescription refills after an ORIF of DRF in patients with an active diagnosis of cannabis use at the time of surgery and in those without. The investigation revealed that there was a significant reduction in average MME for the case population&#8217;s initial opioid prescription compared with the control population. There was also a reduction of average MME in the case population&#8217;s second opioid prescription, however, this difference was not significant.</p><p>Prior studies evaluating the interaction between cannabis and postoperative opioid use have shown varying results. Gofeld et al<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported on a patient who required less patient-controlled analgesia (morphine) with the addition of cannabinoids as an adjunctive therapy during recovery from abdominal wound dehiscence repair procedures. Opioid-sparing effects of cannabinoids have also been demonstrated as a secondary finding in a study done by Schneider-Smith et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> evaluating the use of dronabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid, for postsurgical pain management. The study identified total MME was significantly reduced in cannabis-using patients who received dronabinol as an adjunctive therapy compared with the control group (deficit of 97 MME<italic toggle="yes">, P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Contrary to the opioid-sparing effects of cannabis in the previous studies, there are cohort studies which showed that cannabis users required more opioids for pain management during the acute postoperative recovery period. Jamal et al<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> found that cannabis users required a 23% increase in postoperative opioid use, whereas Jefferson et al<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> found a significant increase in supplemental pethidine usage in cannabis users compared with nonusers (82.7&#8201;mg versus 51.6&#8201;mg, respectively). All of the previously mentioned studies limited their research to inpatient opioid consumption in the immediate postoperative period and do not provide information on opioid consumption after discharge. This study tracks patient&#8217;s opioid filling patterns up to 30 days postoperation, which is more applicable to patients undergoing ORIF of DRF, who are often discharged on the same day of surgery with prescription analgesics. While it is not possible to directly compare this study&#8217;s results with other studies because other authors quantify opioid usage with consumption, and our study with filled opioid volume, results from our study indicate a significant reduction in opioid demand from patients in the case population based on the average amount of MME filled postoperatively.</p><p>When comparing opioid volume of patients&#8217; primary opioid prescription, those with a history and diagnosis of cannabis use showed a significant deficit of 128.35 MME filled per opioid prescription compared with their control counterparts after traumatic hand surgery. The exact mechanism of this opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids in chronic opioid users is not entirely known. Varying theories support that patients could be substituting opioids for cannabis to manage their postsurgery pain<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> or that there could be a synergistic interaction between cannabis and opioids. Smith et al<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and Cichewicz et al.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> demonstrated that administration of THC enhanced the antinociceptive property of morphine in mouse studies. The synergistic effect held true in the opposite direction with morphine enhancing the antinociception induced by THC.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This highlights the potential use of low-dose THC in conjunction with morphine as an alternative regimen that increases the opioid potency while minimizing the adverse effects of either drug when administered at high doses. Though the scarcity of evidence makes it difficult to suggest a synergistic relationship between opioids and cannabinoids in pain management, this study found that the case population filled significantly less opioid volume compared with the control population. As surgeons operate on more patients with a history of cannabis use, further research is required to understand the influential relationship between cannabis and opioids and the possible role of cannabis as an analgesic adjunct in hand surgery.</p><p>The relationship between mental health disorders and persistent opioid use, however, is well established and reflected in this study&#8217;s control group. Patients who filled more than one opioid prescription within 1 month before surgery were 4.80 times more likely to have persistent opioid use. In a retrospective study, Qin et al reported that even a small opioid exposure, including opioids prescribed at initial consultation for surgery, was associated with 2.6 times greater likelihood of persistent use after ORIF of DRF.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> These findings suggest that any opioid exposure, whether consumed or left over, posed a risk of increased opioid demand for postoperative pain management.</p><p>Patients in the control group with an active diagnosis of major depressive disorder had a significantly increased risk of filling two or more opioid prescriptions after hand surgery. This study&#8217;s findings were consistent with previous studies further augmenting the relationship between mental health diagnoses and the increased opioid demand and risk of misuse. Johnson et al reported that mental health disorders, including depression, were associated with prolonged postoperative opioid use after common hand procedures.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Those with current mood disorders initiated opioid therapy more often, continue opioid usage for lower levels of pain, and are twice as likely to transition into chronic opioid use.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Qin et al focused on the influence of mental health disorders on patients undergoing open surgical treaent of DRF, which also showed similar results.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>The same influence of mental health diagnoses and substance use disorder on opioid filling patterns was not evident in a subgroup analysis of patients with an active diagnosis of cannabis use. Instead, the greatest and only risk factor associated with increased opioid prescription refills was preoperative opioid use. This study suggests that in patients with a diagnosis of cannabis use, those who have concurrent depression, anxiety, or substance abuse diagnoses, may not require additional opiates for pain management following ORIF of DRF. Therefore, physicians can tailor their postoperative opioid prescriptions to meet this decreased demand, whether it be by reducing the amount of MME given at first or second prescription. Collectively, it is important for surgeons to educate their patients on the risks of opioid use and explore different pain management strategies, such as peripheral nerve blocks, antiinflammatories, acetaminophen, anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin), and other measures to reduce narcotic burden in the pre- and postoperative period.</p><p>This study has several limitations due to its retrospective nature and function as an insurance-claims-based database. A patient&#8217;s relationship with cannabis use is frequently reported in the social history portion of a history and physical and may not be coded as such. This opens the possibility that patients in the control group could be using cannabis peri-operatively without a diagnosis of cannabis use, demonstrating an under-representation of cannabis use. Results from this study showed that 0.37% of patients undergoing ORIF of DRF had an active diagnosis of cannabis use within 6 months prior to surgery. This is consistent with two previous PearlDiver based studies by Sambandam et al<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and Law et al,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> which showed prevalence rates of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with a diagnosis of cannabis use. This study limited our case population to patients with an active diagnosis of cannabis use within 6 months of surgery to increase the validity of our findings. This inclusion criterion accounts for the smaller prevalence of cannabis users found in our study compared with Law et al, which did not include such a criterion. Also, the incidence of cannabis dependence seen in the Pearldiver database was comparable to the national population prevalence of ~0.8% reported between 2010 and 2020.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> These findings warrant prospective studies to determine discrepancies in the usage and diagnosis of cannabis use in patients undergoing traumatic hand surgery and, if present, how these discrepancies influence the results in this study.</p><p>This study could not determine the quantity or frequency of cannabis use by patients due to the limitations of using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. While these variables could influence the effects of this study, Jefferson et al found that in the subset of cannabis users, there was no significant difference in analgesia requirements with duration of cannabis exposure, estimated quantity of cannabis used, and last preoperative exposure.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Additionally, the amount of actual opioid consumption could not be reported. Our study provides the average MME per prescription, duration of prescription, and number of opioid prescriptions filled by patients as a proxy for postoperative opioid demand. Although the results cannot be generalized to opioid consumption by patients, the results from this study are still significant, as studies have shown that both consumed and unconsumed opioids increase the risk of future misuse.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> To further support our study&#8217;s significance, Brat et al<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> found that additional opioid refills and increased duration of prescription were significantly associated with an increased risk of future opioid misuse, 44% and 19.9% increase, respectively. Despite the limitations mentioned above, this is the largest retrospective analysis to date examining the effects of preoperative cannabis use on acute pain management in hand surgery. This study also controls for comorbidities, such as mental health diagnoses and substance use diagnoses, which previous studies have shown to influence opioid use, misuse, and abuse in the postoperative period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study found that patients with a diagnosis of cannabis use filled a significantly reduced volume of opioids, measured as MME per prescription, in their first opioid prescription after ORIF of DRF compared with their control counterparts. Depression was associated with an increased risk of prolonged prescription refills in patients without a diagnosis of cannabis use. Preoperative chronic opioid use, defined as filling of more than one opioid prescription, increased the likelihood of additional prescription opioids across all studied groups. Due to the risks of opioids, it is important to take a patient&#8217;s relationship with cannabis, as well as their mental health into consideration before prescribing opioids, as well as a continued effort to decrease opioid exposure and utilize various reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="s1" content-type="document" xlink:href="gox-11-e4901-s001.pdf" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 3 April 2023.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Disclosure:</bold>
