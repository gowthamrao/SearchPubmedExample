Increasing recognition of the importance of identifying vulnerable populations has raised a demand for better tools. One of these tools is the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The SVI was created in 2011 to identify and plan assistance for socially vulnerable populations during hazardous events, by providing disaster management personnel information to target specific areas. We aimed to evaluate and determine the social vulnerability in different provinces and districts of Peru in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic using an adapted version of the SVI index. Ecological, observational, and cross-sectional study was conducted. We adapted the SVI and collected indicators related to COVID-19. We organized and analyzed the population data of the 196 provinces of Peru, using data from government institutions. We found a distribution of high and very high SVI in the mountainous areas of Peru. High and very high social vulnerability indexes, due to the presence of some or all the variables were predominantly distributed in the provinces located in the southern and highlands of the country. The association between mortality rate and social SVI-COVID19 was inverse, the higher the vulnerability, the lower the mortality. Our results identify that the provinces with high and very high vulnerability indexes are mostly located in rural areas nearby the Andes Mountains, not having a direct correlation with COVID-19 mortality.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Center for Global Health and Social Responsibility, University of Minnesota</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>Shailendra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fogarty International Center/National Institutes of Health</institution></funding-source><award-id>D43TW009345 / D43TW009763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7949-0393</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Contreras</surname><given-names>Pavel J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by a Global Engagement Grant from the Center for Global Health and Social Responsibility, University of Minnesota (GEG to SP).

Introduction</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded governments and diverse organizations to work on strategies to prepare and help communities to face the pandemic. Peru has been one of the most affected countries in the world.</p><p>Certain populations could be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and more likely to manifest with more severe disease. This vulnerability reflects limited capacity of certain populations to mitigate, treat, and delay the transmission of pandemic disease, and reduce its clinical, economic, and social impacts [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of the factors contributing to this vulnerability, particularly those from the social determinants of health, are preventable and mitigable.</p><p>Social vulnerability (SV) is described as &#8220;the properties of a person or group in terms of their ability to anticipate, deal, resist and recover from the impact&#8221; of a discrete and identifiable event in nature or society [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, social vulnerability mainly refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks -such as COVID19 [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SV is closely related to the presence of social determinants of health. The World Health Organization defines these as "the circumstances in which people are born, grow, work, live and age, including the broader set of forces and systems that influence the conditions of life every day" [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development programs, social norms and policies, and political systems [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Evidence indicates that people with more economical disadvantages are most vulnerable at all stages, before, during, and after a catastrophic event [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Socially vulnerable communities are more likely to experience high rates of mortality, morbidity, and property destruction, and are less able to achieve a post disaster recovery than less socially vulnerable communities [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These vulnerable communities include racial and ethnic minorities; children, the elderly or disabled people; and residents of certain types of housing, particularly high-rise or mobile houses [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that the most vulnerable people or communities have not been sufficiently considered in the planning and response to adverse events by local and national authorities. For example, in the case of Peru, the COVID-19 related information may not adequately reach indigenous communities that speak native languages &#8203;&#8203;(Quechua, Aymara, or Amazonian languages) [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and health services access for affected populations is difficult due to the absence of adequate roads or nearby health facilities [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>These populations need to be identified in the preparation of local response planning by government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Effectively decreasing social vulnerability minimizes both human suffering and financial loss related to the provision of social services and public assistance after a disaster [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Within the territorial framework of Peru, local authorities could identify vulnerable communities in their geographical area, but Peruvian heath institutions are commonly underfunded, understaffed, and stretched thin by ongoing health and social service responsibilities would have a tough time to accomplish [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Increasing recognition of the importance of identifying vulnerable populations has raised a demand for better tools. One of these tools is the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).</p><p>The SVI was created in 2011 by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry&#8217;s (ATSDR) Geospatial Research, Analysis &amp; Services Program (GRASP) [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], to enable the public health community to quickly and precisely identify and plan assistance for socially vulnerable populations over the entire course of hazardous events [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The index was created to be applied during all phases of the emergency, including planning, response, mitigation, and recovery. It was first used retrospectively in the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans in 2005 where the potential predictive power of the SVI was studied [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The SVI can provide state, local, and tribal disaster management personnel information to target specific areas that may be socially vulnerable before, during, and after a hazard event.</p><p>The SVI has been validated and adapted in different parts of the world, such as Botswana [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and China [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the case of COVID19, it was used in Nigeria [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the United States, showing its adaptability to different contexts, and its ability to help authorities allocate adequate resources [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Potential uses of SVI are: help emergency response planners and public health officials identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event and to estimate the number of needed supplies, or where to allocate and prioritize material and human resources, also it could help decide how many emergency personnel are required to assist people and to identify communities that will need continued support to recover following an emergency or natural disaster [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused a negative impact on the population&#8217;s health and on their ability to deal with and recover. However, this vulnerability has not yet been characterized enough. Specifically, any measurement of social vulnerability needs to be considered in the specific context of vulnerability to COVID-19 [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This would lead to identifying the geographical regions that, due to their socioeconomic characteristics, infrastructure, population, and access to health, may be more vulnerable and require the greatest support and attention from the national or regional government.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>II.

Provinces can assume the role of basic unit of territorial development planning due to its intermediate nature. There are 196 provinces of Peru that can be classified by strata according to their number of inhabitants, which correlates directly with their human development index (HDI) [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The first stratum corresponds to Metropolitan Lima and Callao with more than 10 million inhabitants.

Four themes correspond to the CDC SVI and refer to 1) socioeconomic status, 2) household composition and disability, 3) belonging to a minority group and language, and 4) type of housing and transportation. The COVID-19 specific factors were: 5) <italic toggle="yes">epidemiological factors</italic>, based on guidelines from the WHO and the Peruvian Ministry of Health, which identify populations at risk of acquiring severe forms of the disease and, therefore, have higher mortality from COVID-19; and 6) <italic toggle="yes">health system factors</italic>, including data related to the capacity, strength, and readiness of the health system in relation to the needs posed by COVID-19. We also included the number of hospital beds, total health spending and the percentage of regional health budget spending, number of doctors per 100,000, as well as the number of ICU beds and the number of mechanical ventilators available by region.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Estimation of SVI-COVID19</title><p>For the construction of the SVI-COVID-19 indicators, the 33 variables were expressed in population percentages or incidents, which were arranged in ascending order per the 196 provinces of Peru. We ranked negative variables (i.e., poverty) from 1 to 196, and positive variables (i.e., income) whose higher percentage value in the population meant less vulnerability from 196 to 1. Subsequently, we calculated the percentile-ranks with the formula: Percentile-rank = (Rank&#8212;1) / 195. We then summed up the indicators by topics of the SVI-COVID19 and performed the calculation of ranks and percentile ranks by topic. Finally, the index was classified into quintiles, obtaining the following groups: very low vulnerability (&lt;20%), low (20&#8211;40%), moderate (40&#8211;60%), high (60&#8211;80%), and very high (&gt; 80%). We then calculated the death rate from COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants for each of the provinces of Peru between April 2020 to September 2021. This period includes both two more lethal COVID-19 waves during the pandemic in Peru.</p><p>Death from COVID-19 was determined under the standard established by SINADEF, which includes cases confirmed by a positive molecular, antigenic, or serological laboratory test, as well as the diagnoses indicated in the medical certificate.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We performed descriptive statistics by calculating the means and medians as appropriate for each SVI-COVID19 indicator. We then created a bivariate map to show the vulnerability index for each province and the COVID-19 mortality rate as a dependent variable. Additionally, we performed a multivariable analysis using a negative binomial regression. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) were calculated and adjusted by population density with their respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The bivariate map was generated in ArcGIS 10.7 and the statistical analysis was made in the STATA v.17.0 statistical software package.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The research ethics committee of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia approved the study protocol with certificate No. 501-28-20. Since this was an ecological study with a secondary database, no individuals were evaluated and no personal data were accessed, so there were no risks associated with data confidentiality. In this sense, informed consent was not required for our study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>III. Results</title><p>We evaluated all 196 provinces of Per&#250;.

sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>IV. Discussion</title><p>In this study we adapted the SVI tool and included COVID-19 specific epidemiological (Obesity, Smoking, Cardiovascular diseases, Immunosuppression, etc.) and health system factors (ICU beds, number of physicians, per capita expenditure in health, number of COVID19 laboratories, etc.) to categorize the social vulnerability in various provinces of Peru. We then compared these to the mortality data from 2017 to 2020. As expected, we identified the distribution of the high and very high vulnerability index in rural provinces located or bordering the Andes Mountains. These are due to the lower access to health services and other public services, as well as unfavorable socioeconomic conditions in the populations in the mountainous regions of Peru [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru also identifies these high Andean and Amazonian areas as the most vulnerable to any health condition or disaster [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our vulnerability finding coincides and represents the unfavorable conditions of many provinces against COVID-19 and, probably, many other acute and chronic health problems.</p><p>The six themes in our instrument varied in distribution across Peru with socioeconomic vulnerability, housing, and transportation are distributed in the Peruvian highlands, the conditions of epidemiological vulnerability in the coastal areas, and the conditions of health system vulnerability in the southern part of the country.</p><p>We found that the mortality from COVID-19 increases with factors reflecting the composition of the household or the presence of a disability. Considering that the composition of the household evaluates vulnerable groups such as the elderly, minors, and the presence of disability, this result reflects the known biological vulnerability to COVID-19 [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or other factors that generate vulnerability in these groups. Similarly, and to a greater extent, we saw increased mortality from COVID-19 and the presence of epidemiological factors such as obesity, cardio-metabolic, and chronic respiratory diseases, corroborating that the presence of this group of comorbidities increases the fatal outcome from COVID-19, therefore, placing populations with these comorbidities in a situation of higher mortality [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The death rate from COVID-19 was higher in coastal areas of Peru- areas in which the pandemic is known to have started and spread rapidly. However, in most of these provinces, the SVI-COVID19 assessment was low or very low, indicating that with the COVID-19 pandemic there are other variables or factors that should be considered beyond those included in our instrument. We can infer, for example, that coastal areas with low vulnerability have greater urbanization, higher population density that led to closer contact between individuals, greater saturation of hospitalization and emergency services in hospitals, higher mobilization of people within the city and between provinces, and a greater probability of areas of agglomeration thereby increasing the transmission of SARS- CoV-2 [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The set of the six themes evaluated with SVI-COVID19 present a negative association with the mortality rate from COVID-19, that is, the higher the social vulnerability, the lower the mortality. This result is partially consistent with studies carried out in the United States, where the evaluation of the first months of the pandemic mentions a positive association between mortality from COVID-19 and SVI, which differs from our study. However, as the pandemic progresses, we observed a reverse association, showing that the relationship between both variables is not unidirectional, and is dependent on the time course of the pandemic [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This may be partly due to public health interventions. For example, since the start of the pandemic in Peru, there have been numerous interventions from the Ministry of Health at the national level to prevent and control the pandemic. Due to the emergency, these measures were multiple, and some were constantly variable, including implementation and relaxation periods, depending on the pandemic epidemiologic situation [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Two other elements can explain this factor. COVID-19 disproportionately impacted less vulnerable counties early and later in the pandemic. In the first place, the population with the highest socioeconomic level was affected, later expanding to the rest of the population. This suggests that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable ones and back again over time [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the communities with the lowest vulnerability index had access to private health services, which to a certain extent were able to absorb the number of patients. However, with the general increase in cases, the health system (public and private) was saturated and unable to respond to the amount of population in need of medical care, affecting the entire population in general, and thus the "advantage" observed at the beginning, could have been diluted, generating in practice a barrier to access that could be comparable to that in which hospital services are non-existent or very scarce. It should be noted that at the beginning of the pandemic (hospital capacity indicators compared to LATAM) and the closing of this gap was partial, late and transitory [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, social vulnerability is directly related to the existence of gaps in the six topics of our instrument, which can also be analyzed from the point of view of inequities and inequality in health, the latter understood as the different distribution of wealth and access to care according to geographic location. Thus, we consider that the SVI represents a measurement of health inequities, therefore, of the existing gaps in Peru [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>It is necessary to consider the possible influence of social vulnerability with the underreporting of deaths, considering that SINADEF is a computer tool whose registration is more complex in areas without internet access, which has been exacerbated during the first and second waves of the pandemic [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The results of the negative association between SVI-COVID19 and the COVID-19 mortality rate could be explained in part by the low registration of mortality, specifically in populations with the greatest social vulnerability. The mortality registration in regions of Amazonas, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Jun&#237;n, Loreto, and Pasco, of Peru is less than or equal to 60%. Since these are regions with higher social vulnerability, our results may be skewed due to unregistered deaths.</p><p>During 2020 and 2021, registers showed a significant exceed in the number of deaths, according to the reference pattern previously estimated by the INEI for those years. The estimates of deaths expected by the INEI only reach the regional level, but not provinces or districts.</p><p>A limitation in our study is the use of mortality data. While the current mode of collecting mortality data by the internet has increased the overall collection of data, it has likely led to underreporting from areas with poor technology and internet connectivity [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The registration of deaths with medical certification in Peru&#8211;with documentation of the cause of death&#8212;in 2019 was 71.6%, so 54,372 deaths in 2019 did not have a medical death certificate or whose medical certificate of death was not entered into SINADEF or the EsSalud mortality database. SINADEF is not the only death registration system with medical certification of causes of death. EsSalud registered 17,483 deaths that are not registered in SINADEF. The registered deaths drop to 62.15% of all deaths if we consider deaths registered by SINADEF [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, other studies report that good socioeconomic conditions and health expenditures, parameters considered in the SVI, can reduce the rate of COVID-19 infection when the incidence is low, but not when the spread has an exponential advance [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Among the limitations of our study is the ecological design, since the results can only be interpreted at a population level and cannot address the characteristics that can help to identify the individual factors that can define the personal resilience ability to respond to the COVID19 pandemic. The data obtained from institutional databases could present underreporting bias or misclassification, especially for populations with less accessibility. The cross-sectional characteristic of our study limits the understanding of the evolutionary process of the risks or vulnerable conditions in relation to the health measures or policies assumed by the Government. Considering the existing inequalities within the 25 regions that make up Peru, further studies that look at vulnerability analysis with a greater spatial disaggregation, particularly for non COVID19 specific issues, including that of other diseases and conditions that have been unfortunately neglected due to the pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>V. Conclusions</title><p>Our results identify the provinces of the country with high and very high vulnerability, most of which are in the rural areas bordering the Andes Mountains. Through this mapping, the index can help government authorities to improve prevention, control, and resource management policies in more detail [<xref rid="pgph.0001330.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that this negative association found between SVI and the mortality rate could be related to the low reporting coverage of deaths in general and deaths from COVID-19 in the provinces with a higher index of social vulnerability.</p><p>Likewise, this study highlights the need for better registration and epidemiological reporting systems. As we have seen, there is a limitation, which mainly affects rural and poor populations, in terms of adequate health data, which can lead to misreporting and potentially increase health inequalities to the detriment of vulnerable people, especially in Andean and Amazonian areas. Likewise, it can orient authorities incorrectly by giving a false perception about the actual health needs of the populations under study and directing the limited resources oriented towards health.</p><p>Additional studies are required to determine the causes of the paradoxical results found in this study to assess the importance of other individual and community factors that may have affected the burden of disease due to COVID19.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. Javier Vargas Herrera for his contribution to the understanding of SINADEF.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0001330.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Su&#225;rez Lastra</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Vald&#233;s Gonz&#225;lez</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Galindo P&#233;rez</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Salvador Guzm&#225;n</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Ruiz-Rivera</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Alc&#225;ntara-Ayala</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>&#205;ndice de vulnerabilidad ante el COVID-19 en M&#233;xico</article-title>. <source>Investigaciones geogr&#225;ficas</source>. <year>2021</year>(<issue>104</issue>).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pgph.0001330.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Araujo Gonz&#225;lez</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><article-title>Vulnerabilidad y riesgo en salud: &#191;dos conceptos concomitantes?</article-title><source>Revista Novedades en poblaci&#243;n</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>11</volume>(<issue>21</issue>):<fpage>89</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>96</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pgph.0001330.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Wisner</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Blaikie</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Cannon</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>. <source>At risk: natural hazards, people&#8217;s vulnerability and disasters: Routledge</source>; <year>2014</year>.

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p><p>1. Does this manuscript meet PLOS Global Public Health&#8217;s <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/criteria-for-publication" ext-link-type="uri">publication criteria</ext-link>? Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions? The manuscript must describe methodologically and ethically rigorous research with conclusions that are appropriately drawn based on the data presented.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;No</p><p>**********</p><p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;No</p><p>**********</p><p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available (please refer to the Data Availability Statement at the start of the manuscript PDF file)?</p><p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data&#8212;e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party&#8212;those must be specified.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;Yes</p><p>**********</p><p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p><p>PLOS Global Public Health does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Yes</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;No</p><p>**********</p><p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#160;Nice manuscript.</p><p>Authors need to take note of the following:</p><p>1. the abstract does not well represent the body of the work.</p><p>2. Line 68: remove the underscore sign</p><p>3. Line 70-71: the sentence is incomplete</p><p>4. Line 272-274: the citation appears counterintuitive. Are the authors sure of the information presented? Please verify</p><p>5. Can the 33 variables be presented in tabular format for the sake of clarity?</p><p>6. Please provide justification for the choice of study variables.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;This study aims to investigate the relationship between SVI-COVID factors and COVID mortality in 196 provinces in Peru. My comments/questions are listed below. Overall, the manuscript does not meet the standard of publications and requires substantial revision.</p><p>1. I feel that Table 1 about SVI uses in Introduction is not needed and many are not relevant to this manuscript. The author may want to consider summarizing SVI in text.</p><p>2. Some sentences in Introduction do not provide meaningful messages. More in-depth literature review may be necessary. For example, page 6, line 112-113. However, SVI is expected to be different across provinces in any country. The extent of difference may be large or small. Social determinants are known to affect people and communities (this is very broad).</p><p>3. Please provide more details in data sources, in addition to listing the websites. For example, number of provinces (regions in Peru), brief summary of data. For the mortality data, why was April 2020 to Sep 2021 selected? Please also describe definition and approaches to identify death from COVID-19 in this section. I&#8217;m wondering if there is any difference in mortality over time?</p><p>4. Page 7, line 141. The reference is not related to COVID-19. Suggest cite the reference right after SVI.</p><p>5. In terms of estimation of SVI-COVID19, the variables were treated with equal weight. This may not be the most efficient approach. Ranking may result in some loss of information.</p><p>6. Did the author mean to say random &#8220;intercept&#8221;? From my understanding, there were a total of 196 observations (provinces). Random intercept is not feasible in this case. What does &#8220;multiple analyses&#8221; mean? Replications or change of methods? Please list any covariates here as well.</p><p>7. Please spell out all abbreviations the first time using it, e.g., CI, RR, IRRa. IRRa was used in text, whereas RR was used in Table 3. I think they refer to the same numbers? Please confirm what statistics to report and be consistent.</p><p>8. In table 2, should most of the numbers multiply by 100 since many units are in %? Please present lower and upper quartiles if choosing to report median and SD in the table.</p><p>9. In Discussion, the authors said that they adapted a validated tool to include COVID-19 specific factors to categorize the social vulnerability in various provinces of Peru (page 13, line 242). I don&#8217;t see where a validated tool was mentioned. Does this mean SVI? I suggest to say SVI directly. What are COVID-10 specific factors? Perhaps this means COVID-19 labs? Please clarify.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
