We then conducted fixed-effects multinomial regression analysis to examine the associations between group membership and both facility-level characteristics (public vs private and accepting Medicaid vs not) and county-level characteristics (metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan, percentage of residents who are Hispanic, percentage of residents who are Black, and median household income).

This finding is consistent with recent studies in the literature.<sup><xref rid="zoi240669r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi240669r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>In addition, we found that MHTFs offering telehealth at wave 2 were providing more limited services&#8212;for example, more frequently requiring video-based telehealth, declining services for comorbid AUD, and placing limitations on availability of telehealth services for psychotherapy and medication management compared with wave 1. One potential explanation for this is that the end of the PHE may have had a chilling effect on clinician behavior; during the COVID-19 pandemic, HIPAA and regulatory agencies offered broad discretion to clinicians to encourage telehealth utilization for nonemergency services.<sup><xref rid="zoi240669r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> By contrast, state and federal guidance has become more stringent following the conclusion of the PHE, including by CMS.<sup><xref rid="zoi240669r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Interestingly, Medicaid acceptance was associated with much lower odds of being a nonadopter across time periods. One explanation for this may be that facilities accepting Medicaid are also likely to have different target clientele, including those with more limited time and resources who might therefore benefit uniquely from the improved accessibility through telehealth.<sup><xref rid="zoi240669r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Given the prominent role of individual states in determining Medicaid benefits, future research might evaluate the extent to which trajectories of telehealth coverage vary according to state Medicaid policies.</p><p>Our analysis benefited from a secret shopper approach, which reduces social desirability bias among respondents. We successfully contacted over 1000 MHTFs throughout the US both during and after the end of the PHE. Our analysis of nonresponse bias also suggests that the analytic sample is representative of MHTFs more generally that report to SAMHSA, although we can only state this with respect to observable characteristics.</p><sec id="H2-7-ZOI240669"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had limitations, including potential nonresponse bias, changes in telehealth policy apart from the PHE that could influence MHTF operations, and insufficient statistical power to conduct comparative analyses across other sociodemographic categories. Appropriateness of telehealth vs in-person care may differ across heterogeneous populations, as may quality of care, and our study is unable to comment on this.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI240669"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This longitudinal study identified evolving patterns in telehealth availability for mental health care over a 1-year period during which the COVID-19 PHE expired. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring access to mental health care in a postpandemic era, especially against the backdrop of the federal and state policy landscape.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI240669"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi240669r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>McBain</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Schuler</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Qureshi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></string-name>, <etal/></person-group>. <article-title>Expansion of telehealth availability for mental health care after state-level policy changes from 2019 to 2022</article-title>. <source>JAMA Netw Open</source>. <year>2023</year>;<volume>6</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<elocation-id>e2318045</elocation-id>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18045</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">37310741</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC10265313</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi240669r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>C</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Wall</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Olfson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Implications of telepsychiatry for cost, quality, and equity of mental health care</article-title>. <source>JAMA Psychiatry</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>79</volume>(<issue>12</issue>):<fpage>1147</fpage>-<lpage>1148</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.3330</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">36260304</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi240669r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Shachar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Elwyn</surname><given-names>G</given-names></string-name></person-group>. <article-title>Implications for telehealth in a postpandemic future: regulatory and privacy issues</article-title>. <source>JAMA</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>323</volume>(<issue>23</issue>):<fpage>2375</fpage>-<lpage>2376</lpage>. doi:<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.2020.7943</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32421170</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="zoi240669r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><string-name name-style="western"><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>C</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Lew</surname><given-names>ND</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western"><surname>Sommers</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></string-name></person-group>.
