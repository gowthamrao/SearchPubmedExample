associated hospitalizations has been increasing for nearly two decades. Due
to issues ranging from ongoing substance use to peripherally inserted
central catheter safety, many clinicians find discharge decision-making
challenging. Typically, clinicians advise patients to remain hospitalized
for several weeks for intravenous antimicrobial treatment; however, some
patients may desire other antimicrobial treatment options. A structured
conversation guide, delivered by infectious disease physicians, intended to
inform hospital discharge decisions has the potential to enhance patient
participation in decisions. We developed a conversation guide in order to:
(1) investigate its feasibility and acceptability and (2) examine
experiences, outcomes, and lessons learned from use of the guide.</p></sec><sec id="section2-20499361231165108"><title>Methods:</title><p>We interviewed physicians after they each piloted the conversation guide with
two patients. We interviewed patients immediately after the conversation and
again 4&#8211;6 weeks later. Two analysts indexed transcriptions and used the
framework method to identify and organize relevant information. We conducted
retrospective chart review to corroborate and contextualize qualitative
data.</p></sec><sec id="section3-20499361231165108"><title>Results:</title><p>Eight patients and four infectious disease physicians piloted the
conversation guide. All patients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;8) completed
antimicrobial treatment. Nearly all participants believed the conversation
guide was important for incorporating patient values and preferences.
Patients reported an increased sense of autonomy, but felt post-discharge
needs could be better addressed. Physician participants identified the
guide&#8217;s long length and inclusion of pain management as areas for
improvement.</p></sec><sec id="section4-20499361231165108"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A novel conversation guide to inform hospital discharge decision-making for
patients with IDU-associated infections was feasible, acceptable, and
fostered the incorporation of patient preferences and values into decisions.
While we identified areas for improvement, overall participants believed
that this novel conversation guide helped to improve patient care and
autonomy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>infective endocarditis</kwd><kwd>injection drug use</kwd><kwd>shared-decision making</kwd><kwd>substance use</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-20499361231165108"><funding-source id="funding1-20499361231165108"><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational

continue. Due to unsafe supply and challenges in accessing prevention and treatment services,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> the trend may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.
Severe IDU-associated infections are often treated with 4&#8211;6&#8201;weeks of intravenous
(IV) antimicrobial treatment in concordance with treatment guidelines. However,
transitioning care to the outpatient setting can be challenging: many home health
agencies and post-acute care facilities will not accept patients with substance use
disorders (SUD), possibly due to stigma and restrictive policies, such as the need
to coordinate with opioid treatment programs for patients treated with methadone.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> In practice, many inpatient-based health care professionals recommend that
people with IDU-associated infections remain hospitalized for prolonged periods
because of the concern that they will inject drugs into indwelling central venous
catheters, thereby risking another infection or death.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> While prolonged hospitalizations might be justified to prevent self-harm,
they may also infringe on patient autonomy. Patient autonomy is one of the central
principles of medical ethics;<sup>
<xref rid="bibr10-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> however, patients are often not given the ability to choose among medically
feasible options which align with their values. In addition, this approach can be
stigmatizing and result in costly hospitalizations with unfavorable outcomes such as
premature discharges (also known as self-directed discharges (SDD) or leaving
&#8216;against medical advice&#8217;).<sup><xref rid="bibr11-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Premature discharges are particularly unsafe for rural
patients, who often lack access to important resources.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> Instead, other treatment options, such as being discharged with a central
venous catheter for outpatient IV therapy, weekly long-acting antibiotic IV
infusions, or oral antibiotics, coupled with harm reduction services, merit
consideration as they may improve engagement in care.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, these treatment
options have been understudied, particularly in rural states, and there is no
standardized approach to discussing these antimicrobial options with patients.</p><p>Shared decision-making has the potential to transform care for patients hospitalized
with IDU-associated infections. Guide-based shared decision-making research is
lacking in stigmatized populations, such as patients with SUD. Experts in palliative
care have developed conversation guides to increase rates of serious illness
conversations between patients and their providers.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These guides provide language
for providers to use, along with a structured approach to enable providers to
confidently engage in exploration of patient values and preferences.</p><p>In this pilot study, we developed a conversation guide for clinicians to utilize with
patients with IDU-associated infections discharged to rural communities or counties
at risk for HIV/hepatitis outbreaks.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> The goals of the guide were to improve patient autonomy and help clinicians
and patients with IDU-associated infections make shared decisions about hospital
disposition (i.e. remain hospitalized, discharge with central line, discharge with
weekly infusions, or discharge on oral antimicrobials). Our study objectives were to
(1) develop and pilot a structured conversation guide for hospital discharge
decision-making with patients experiencing IDU-associated infections, (2)
investigate the guide&#8217;s feasibility and acceptability, and (3) examine patient and
provider experiences, patient outcomes, and lessons learned.</p></sec><sec id="section6-20499361231165108"><title>Case study</title><p>To demonstrate how the guide can be used in practice, we provide a case presentation:

</sup> elements of the guide include setting up the conversation, assessing
understanding of the infection, sharing prognosis, exploring key topics (such as
patient preferences and values, pain management), antimicrobial trade-offs
[remaining inpatient, discharging home or elsewhere with a peripherally inserted
central catheter (PICC), partial IV/oral antimicrobials, intermittent or weekly
infusions, of oral antimicrobials], and closing the conversation.</p><p>To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the guide, we piloted it with 8
patients with IDU-associated infections and 4 ID physicians (each of which used
the guide with 2 patients). We used a case studies approach: each use of the
guide constituted an in-depth case study. We used the framework method to
organize our cases,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> triangulating perspectives from the patient, physician,
and objective measures. We interviewed the patient immediately after using the
conversation guide and again 4&#8211;6&#8201;weeks later, to assess long-term impacts. We
interviewed each physician who piloted the guide immediately afterward to obtain
feedback on guide usability. We measured objective outcomes, such as
antimicrobial treatment completion and engagement in care after hospital
discharge, by retrospective review of electronic health records (EHRs).
Reporting race and ethnicity in this study was mandated by the US National
Institutes of Health (NIH), consistent with the Inclusion of Women, Minorities,
and Children policy. Race was self-reported by study participants, and race
categories were defined by investigators based on the US Office of Management
and Budget&#8217;s Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data
on Race and Ethnicity.<sup>

occupies a separate row, and categories of information occupy columns.
Categories were determined <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> and included acceptability
of the guide, perceived benefits and challenges to its use in shared
decision-making, and satisfaction with the conversation and the decision. We
also performed a descriptive analysis of outcomes including the treatment
decision that resulted from the conversation guide [e.g. inpatient, outpatient,
partial IV/oral (PO), or intermittent or weekly antimicrobial infusions],
antimicrobial treatment completion, initiation of medication for opioid use
disorder treatment, and use of preventive strategies such as naloxone
prescribing. Information from interviews, along with data from EHR
(demographics, clinical course outcome), were combined to create a narrative of
each case to capture and summarize the full context of the interaction, health
status, and issues that came into play during the conversation guide. The
framework approach facilitates thematic analysis across cases by comparing and
contrasting information summarized in each category.<sup>

important opportunity to learn from patients:<disp-quote><p>. . . it was nice to be able to ask [patients] about . . . their goals. I
think that&#8217;s important. (ID Physician 3)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Some physician participants anticipated that when they offered a spectrum of
antimicrobial treatment options to patients, most patients would choose the
option that involved oral antimicrobial agents and a shorter hospitalization.
However, they learned that patients made decisions thoughtfully, and several
patients preferred completing IV antimicrobial treatment plans:<disp-quote><p>One of the things that my mentors have told me was, &#8216;Tell somebody who
injects drugs that they could leave the hospital with oral
[antimicrobials] and they&#8217;ll take you up on that option&#8217;. And in fact,
my experience has been that you can have an open and frank conversation
with somebody . . . I had this experience before the guide, but I
certainly felt this way with the guide, that patients can be empowered
to stay if you explain why you want them to stay . . . it&#8217;s definitely
paternalistic medicine to not be offering or explaining what the options
are. And then it&#8217;s our job to explain why we think one option is better
than another. (ID Physician 1)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section17-20499361231165108"><title>Physicians recognizing the relevance of patient values/goals</title><p>The conversation guide gave physicians the opportunity to understand patient
values and goals for treatment of their infection (e.g. what matters to patients
most about treating their infection). One physician also felt that this
information was helpful for minimizing unsafe discharges:<disp-quote><p>. . . knowing where people are coming from and what their goals are [is
important] . . . sometimes it comes up in the heat of the moment, as
someone is threatening to leave, and you realize, oh it&#8217;s because they
need to go and do X, Y, and Z. And we should have figured that out
earlier. (ID Physician 2)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Physician participants believed that the information from the conversation guides
were important and relevant to include in antimicrobial treatment decisions:<disp-quote><p>. . . it&#8217;s still important to have open discussions with people,
understand their goals, worries, strengths, and weakness. And I think
the guide helps do that. (ID Physician 1)</p></disp-quote></p><p>The conversation guide allowed space for physicians to understand challenges
patients may face in completing certain treatment options, as well as
highlighting patient-identified strengths for completing treatment. For example,
another physician participant discovered that their patient elected to complete
IV antimicrobial treatment in the hospital because doing so allowed them to
complete their housing application.</p><p>While we identified several themes that highlighted the value of the conversation
guide, we also identified themes involving areas of improvement for the guide:
guide length and timing, how pain management is discussed, addressing
post-discharge needs, and continuity of care (<xref rid="table2-20499361231165108" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). One physician participant
felt that while implementing the conversation guide was feasible, the length of
the guide, which varied anywhere from 15 to 35 min when piloted with patients,
could be improved by shortening it. In addition, some physician participants
felt that implementing the conversation guide at multiple time points during the
hospitalization would be beneficial, given that clinical and psychosocial
situations may change. Some physicians were uncomfortable discussing pain
management and substance use in this context, and they felt that involving other
care team members (e.g. the inpatient addiction medicine team, primary team) was
important. All patient participants found the guide was acceptable and helpful;
however, in follow-up interviews, they reported gaps in essential services
(transportation, housing) and felt that earlier conversations with social work
experts were necessary. Finally, patient participants also felt that continuity
of care could be improved. While they reported a helpful conversation with
physician study participants, they felt other care team members should also
receive education on the conversation guide and treatment options. Patients felt
that weekly service provider changes, with care often being provided by
non-study participants, led to lack of continuity of the care plan discussed
during the structured conversation guide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section18-20499361231165108"><title>Case study</title><p>In order to illustrate the impacts of the conversation guide on a specific
provider&#8211;patient interaction, we included one case presentation: a 40-year-old man
with severe opioid use disorder, treated with buprenorphine/naloxone prior to
admission, chronic hepatitis C, and posttraumatic stress disorder, was hospitalized
for MRSA bacteremia, possible aortic valve endocarditis, and vertebral
osteomyelitis. The patient endorsed injecting opioids prior to admission.
Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were negative for vegetation,
though the latter showed focal thickening of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic
valve and was not able to rule out infective endocarditis. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine indicated epidural phlegmon at L5-S1, not amenable
to drainage. Due to vancomycin intolerance, the patient was started on daptomycin
upon hospitalization. In the setting of 6&#8201;days of positive blood cultures,
ceftaroline was added. The addiction psychiatry service team saw the patient, and he
was eventually restarted on his home dose of buprenorphine, in addition to
hydromorphone as needed for breakthrough pain, Marinol for management of anxiety in
the setting of cannabis withdrawal, and diazepam as needed for anxiety while
hospitalized. Blood cultures cleared after 10&#8201;days, and inflammatory markers
improved. A licensed clinical social worker with the team met with the patient on
hospital day 10 and again throughout the hospitalization to discuss underlying
structural barriers.</p><p>During the clinical encounter that utilized the conversation guide, the patient and
physician discussed possible discharge with the PICC, but due to housing insecurity,
unemployment, and ongoing pain management issues, both agreed that remaining
inpatient for IV antibiotics would be beneficial. They also discussed PICC safety
outside of the hospital. The patient did not feel he would inject into his PICC;
however, he was concerned about potential recurrence of use and subsequent PICC
infection or worsening of infection. The patient and physician also discussed other
antimicrobial treatment options (weekly long-acting antibiotic infusions and oral
doxycycline), but the patient expressed hesitancy about those options due to the
perceived reduced efficacy. On day 30 of hospitalization, however, the patient
expressed interest in being discharged from the hospital if his labs were stable. At
that time, he had a mild score on the clinical opioid withdrawal scale, was not
requiring hydromorphone for breakthrough pain, and was receiving his home dose of
buprenorphine/naloxone. He did not want to continue buprenorphine/naloxone after
discharge, so the care team began to taper his buprenorphine/naloxone dose per
patient preference. He had expressed a desire to stop using opioids however, so
planned to follow up with his outpatient addiction medicine provider. Because the
patient was already aware of the antimicrobial treatment options, the ID team
anticipated the treatment change and arranged for two doses of dalbavancin at the
outpatient infusion center. The patient was discharged 3&#8201;days later with a referral
for hepatitis C treatment and outpatient ID follow-up. He completed his course of
dalbavancin and attended his outpatient ID appointment. He did not have any
subsequent 30-day readmissions or emergency department visits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section19-20499361231165108"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this pilot study, participants felt that a novel, structured conversation guide
was a helpful tool for incorporating patient preferences and discussing
antimicrobial treatment options for IDU- associated infections. The conversation
guide also improved patient autonomy, one of the main principles of medical ethics.
Prior work has examined the use of multidisciplinary teams<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> and risk scores<sup>
<xref rid="bibr27-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> to aid with antimicrobial decision-making decisions. Our pilot study adds to
the literature by providing a practical, harm reduction-based communication strategy
to incorporate patient perspectives and values into medical treatment options and
hospital discharge decision-making.</p><p>In the palliative care field, communication with patients through serious
conversation illness guides have been associated with enhanced goal-consistent care
and better quality of life.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr28-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</sup> While communication strategies around antimicrobial treatment have been
understudied in hospitalized patients with IDU-associated infections, other studies
have shown that treatment outcomes, particularly HIV treatment outcomes, are
favorable when HCPs demonstrate high comfort in discussing substance use with their patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr29-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, however, patient&#8211;HCP discussions of substance use issues are
often lacking,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr30-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</sup> and in a national survey of 672 ID physicians, only 43% of respondents felt
comfortable discussing injection practices with patients.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr31-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup> In the same survey, 82 respondents reported lack of clear guidelines around
discharging patients with PICCs if they have a history of substance use, lack of
resources such as home health facilities, and lack of insurance coverage as some of
the challenges in making antimicrobial treatment decisions. In our study, we found
that the use of a conversation guide to openly discuss these challenges was helpful
to both patients and providers. Discussing patient goals, preferences, and risks and
benefits of antimicrobial treatment options, such as discharging with a PICC, was
feasible and acceptable to both patients and HCPs. Most HCPs and patients in our
study appreciated the structure of the conversation guide, and both patients and
HCPs reported improved knowledge and self-efficacy. These findings are consistent
with prior literature in the palliative care field, where self-efficacy and
knowledge improvement have been associated with use of a serious illness
conversation guide.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr32-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</sup> While more work is needed in applying conversation guides for hospitalized
patients with IDU-associated infections, there is an opportunity to develop and
improve communication strategies around hospital discharge decision-making between
HCPs and hospitalized patients with IDU-associated infections. In addition, feedback
from patient participants suggested the need for improved communication about the
conversation guide, ensuring that information flows from one setting of care to
another (i.e. inpatient to outpatient) and between different care team members.
Additional work is needed to examine additional implications of conversation guide
to health systems, for example, reducing stigma and identifying other care gaps.</p><p>Our pilot study findings should be considered in light of several limitations.
Because it was a single site study in a rural state with a small sample size, our
results may not be transferable to other rural communities, urban areas, or areas
with different patterns of substance use (e.g. an area with more stimulant use,
where pharmacologic treatment options are lacking). Consistent with Maine&#8217;s
demographics, most of our study population was white. Additionally, all of our
patient participants were English-speaking. Given the prevalence of structural
racism and health care disparities in treatment,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-20499361231165108" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</sup> it will be important to do further studies in a more heterogeneous population
and also translate the conversation guide into other languages. Another limitation
is that some treatment options, such as long-acting injectable infusions, may not be
available in all settings. While the conversation guide specifies to offer only
relevant antimicrobial options, it is important to underscore that the conversation
guide should be adapted to align with available antimicrobial treatment options. In
addition, as some patient and HCP participants could have withheld opinions during
study interviews, provision of socially desirable responses may have been a
limitation. Finally, due to scheduling conflicts (patient and physician
availability), several of the patient&#8211;physician conversations occurred when patients
may have been several weeks into their IV antimicrobial course. As suggested by
several of the participants, piloting the conversation guide at multiple time
points, including earlier in the hospitalization, will be important. Additionally,
using the guide in a multidisciplinary format that includes patients, physicians,
and other members of the care team (e.g. care manager, social worker) could address
some of the patient concerns regarding continuity of care issues. Because this is a
pilot study, future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of our
conversation guide with a larger sample size and in more heterogeneous
populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section20-20499361231165108"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this pilot study, the use of a novel conversation guide to inform hospital
discharge decision-making for patients with IDU-associated infections successfully
incorporated patient preferences and values into treatment decisions. Notably, there
were no self-directed discharges, all participants completed antimicrobial
treatment, and most study participants were discharged with medication for opioid
use disorder and naloxone. While we identified areas for improvement, overall
patients and physicians believed that the conversation guide helped to improve
patient care and autonomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section21-20499361231165108" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-20499361231165108" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-tai-10.1177_20499361231165108 &#8211; Supplemental material for &#8216;I
