</title><p id="Par1">Long-term gout treatment is based on reducing serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Most guidelines recommend using a lifelong continuation treat-to-target (T2T) strategy, in which ULT is dosed or combined until a serum urate target has been reached and maintained. However, a frequently used alternative strategy in clinical practice is a treat-to-avoid-symptoms (T2S) ULT discontinuation strategy, with the possibility of restarting the medication. This latter strategy aims at an acceptable symptom state, regardless of serum urate levels. High-quality evidence to support either strategy for patients in prolonged remission while using ULT is lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We developed an investigator-driven pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomized, superiority treatment strategy trial (GO TEST Finale). At least 278 gout patients using ULT who are in remission (&gt;12 months, preliminary gout remission criteria) will be randomized 1:1 to a continued T2T strategy (treatment target serum urate &lt; 0.36 mmol/l) or switched to a T2S discontinuation strategy in which ULT is tapered to stop and restarted in case of (persistent or recurrent) flaring. The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the proportion of patients not in remission during the last 6 months of 24 months follow-up and will be analyzed using a two proportion <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> test. Secondary outcomes are group differences in gout flare incidence, reintroduction or adaptation of ULT, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, serum urate changes, occurrence of adverse events (with a special interest in cardiovascular and renal events), and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study will be the first clinical trial comparing two ULT treatment strategies in patients with gout in remission. It will contribute to more specific and unambiguous guideline recommendations and improved cost-effectiveness of long-term gout treatment. It also paves the way (exploratory) to individualized long-term ULT treatment. In this article, we elaborate on some of our trial design choices and their clinical and methodological consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP) NL9245.

</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background and rationale {6a}</title><p id="Par43">Gout is a rheumatic disease characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid and/or soft tissues during a prolonged state of hyperuricaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Gout has different clinical presentations such as (recurrent) acute arthritis (gout flare), chronic arthritis, tophi, and structural joint damage. Pharmacological management of gout consists of flare treatment with anti-inflammatory medication, and long-term treatment with urate-lowering therapies (ULT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Serum urate levels are lowered below the solubility threshold for MSU to reverse MSU deposition so as to prevent new gout flares and/or to dissolve tophi.</p><p id="Par44">Guidelines of major rheumatology societies recommend ULT using a lifelong treat-to-target (T2T) strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this treat-to-target (T2T) approach, serum urate is lowered by increasing the dose or combining ULT until the target of &lt;0.36mmol/l (6mg/dl) or even &lt;0.30mmol/l (5mg/dl) in patients with tophi, severe polyarticular gout and/or erosions is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and maintained at target. Although globally rheumatologists strongly believe in a continued T2T approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], an alternative strategy also commonly used in daily practice is a treat-to-avoid-symptoms (T2S) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this T2S strategy, ULT is solely dosed on symptoms, regardless of serum urate levels. This strategy is preferred by the American College of Physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], since they state that the benefits of a T2T strategy do not outweigh the disadvantages (e.g. serum urate monitoring and medication escalation).</p><p id="Par45">Although a T2T strategy has proven superior for gout patients in the intensification phase of ULT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], surprisingly, high-quality evidence regarding continued ULT use when remission has been achieved is lacking. It seems sensible to continue ULT for life, since gout is considered a chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A previous systematic review on the discontinuation of ULT included five studies with gout patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These observational studies were performed between 1974 and 2011 and included 10&#8211;211 patients. Gout relapse rates after ULT cessation were 36-81% and gout flares occurred 1&#8211;4.5 years after ULT discontinuation.</p><p id="Par46">In daily practice, ULT is often tapered or stopped in the absence of gout flares. A Dutch retrospective study showed that the non-persistence of allopurinol increased from 39 to 57% 1 and 5 years after ULT initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Only 39% of patients reached medication possession ratios of &#8805;80% during the 5 years of follow-up. This latter is in line with a previous review, which showed an overall ULT adherence rate of 47% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since there is no compelling empirical evidence to continue ULT indefinitely when remission has been achieved, the most recent gout management guideline of the American College for Rheumatology (ACR) states that tapering or discontinuation of ULT can therefore be discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">A few supportive arguments can be made for a T2S discontinuation attempt when remission has been achieved while using ULT. Firstly, gout flares occur in patients after a prolonged state of hyperuricaemia and subsequent accumulation of MSU crystals in the body. This MSU crystal load is reduced after a period of ULT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although it is not clear how long this period must be for protection from gout flare to occur. Secondly, a recent insight shows that hyperuricaemia and gout flares lead to epigenetic changes and adaptation of the innate immune system, which result in an increased pro-inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It was also shown that changes in the trained innate immune system influence the duration and intensity of gout flares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These changes occur under the condition that the stimulus (hyperuricaemia and gout flares) is still present and will sustain for a certain period of time after disappearance of this stimulus. It can be hypothesized that this pro-inflammatory state is reset after prolonged time of remission (absence of gout flares and serum urate normalization due to ULT use) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Gout patients who have been in remission for a longer period of time might therefore be in a state comparable to the period before the clinical signs of gout started. Although hyperuricaemia reoccurs in almost all patients after ULT discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this does not necessarily lead to recurrent gout flares, but may also result in asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.</p><p id="Par48">In conclusion, a continued ULT T2T and T2S discontinuation strategy are both used in clinical practice in gout patients in remission. Although most rheumatologists strongly believe continuing a T2T strategy for life is expected to be superior to a T2S discontinuation strategy, in terms of gout control, the strategies have not been compared before in gout patients in remission. This unanswered question has been included in several (inter)national research agendas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We therefore designed a randomized trial with the objective to demonstrate the superiority of a T2T ULT continuation strategy compared to a T2S discontinuation ULT discontinuation strategy in gout patients in remission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives {7}</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par49">The primary aim of the Gout TrEatment Strategy (GO TEST) Finale study is to investigate whether a continued ULT T2T strategy is superior to switching to a trial and error T2S ULT discontinuation strategy in gout patients currently using ULT and fulfilling preliminary gout remission criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

A taper strategy was recommended over a direct stop strategy by the regional medical review board. This was based on studies that showed associations between cardiovascular events and the start/stop of ULT, presumably due to rapid serum urate changes. Tapering is expected to prevent rapid serum urate changes and thereby serious cardiovascular adverse events. Two weeks after ULT cessation an extra blood sample is obtained to check for any changes in blood counts and kidney and liver function. Serum urate levels will most likely increase, but this is not acted upon as in the T2S discontinuation strategy, ULT treatment is based only on symptoms.

Since visible tophaceous gout at baseline is an exclusion criterion for participation, we chose a uniform treatment target of &lt;0.36mmol/l for the T2T ULT continuation group, with a lower limit of 0.20 mmol/l (0.34 mg/dl). Patients who have had tophi previously are treated using the treatment target of serum urate &lt;0.36 mmol/l. The lower limit was chosen due to suggestions of a correlation between low uric acid and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, in case serum urate level drops below 0.20 mmol/l during follow-up, a dose reduction is considered and, in case serum urate level becomes higher than 0.36 mmol/l and/or gout flares occur ULT treatment is intensified. This latter can be done by increasing dosage, combing or switching ULT until the serum urate target and/or clinical remission are achieved again.

Since the T2S group receives less intensive treatment, the superiority of the T2S discontinuation approach in terms of efficacy is considered unlikely and also irrelevant. After all, one would prefer the less intensive treatment as long as the more intensive treatment is not clearly superior, regardless of whether the less intensive treatment is equally effective or superior. Therefore, we use a one-sided test to achieve the same power to show the superiority of continued T2T with a smaller study size compared to a two-sided test with the same alpha.</p><p id="Par94">Based on earlier studies and on unpublished data from our own cohort (2400 gout patients from Sint Maartenskliniek, Radboudumc and Rijnstate) we estimate that 8% of gout patients following the treat-to-target strategy experience at least 1 gout flare during the 2-year follow-up and 4% of patients are not in remission in the last 6 months of the 24-month follow-up. For the patients in the treat-to-symptom group, less data is available, but we estimate that 12% are not in remission in the last 6 months of the follow-up time, based on the 5 smaller cohort studies included in the review of Beslon et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Using alpha 0.05, power 1-beta 0.80, one-sided superiority testing with a two proportion <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> test, and expected proportion of patients not fulfilling the adapted preliminary remission criteria for gout domains during the last 6 months of the study of 0.04 and 0.12 in the T2T strategy and control group T2S strategy (difference 0.08, number needed to harm, number needed to harm, NNH, 12), 278 analysable patients are needed. Accounting for 10% dropout, 310 patients will be included. If during follow-up dropout turns out to be lower (based on incidence density of dropout/patient-years), fewer patients will be included.</p><p id="Par96">Only when superiority is not shown, non-inferiority (NI) of T2S compared to T2T will also be tested (using a NI margin of 8%, based on the NNH of a maximum of 12). Assuming 278 evaluable patients, point estimates for the primary outcome of 0.04 and 0.05 in the intervention and control group, and one-sided alpha of 5%, the power for proclaiming non-inferiority will be around 87%. However, we are aware of a higher risk of a false-positive result, also because this secondary analysis uses an opposite hypothesis of the original superiority hypothesis, therefore the non-inferiority analysis is considered an exploratory secondary analysis.</p><p id="Par97">The NI margin is just like the difference in the superiority analysis based on the notion &#8212; developed together with patient partners &#8212; that a lower limit of NNH of 12 (not obtaining or loss of gout remission) balances nicely with the numbers needed to benefit of between 2 and 4 of not needing daily ULT pills for up to 2 years.

We would like to highlight and discuss some aspects of the design in more detail below.</p><p id="Par140">First, our hypothesis is superiority on the group level of a ULT T2T continuation strategy compared to switching to a ULT discontinuation T2S strategy in gout patients in remission. The review by Beslon et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed a wide range of gout flare relapse rates in different cohort studies. Possible predictive factors (all not statistically significant) for unsuccessful ULT discontinuation (defined as recurrence of gout) were: higher serum urate levels before and after ULT treatment, higher body mass index (BMI), onset of gout at a young age and longer duration of ULT treatment. Another prospective cohort study found low serum urate levels while using ULT (&lt;0.30 mmol/l or &lt;5.05 mg/dl) and after ULT cessation (&lt;0.51 mmol/l or &lt;8.75 mg/dl), were significantly associated with the longest period of gout-free remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This led to the suggestion that an intermittent ULT strategy might work for some gout patients. Potential predictors including clinical, immunological (epi)genetic and imaging variables will be studied as effect modifiers to explore if personalized treatment advice can be given.</p><p id="Par141">Effects on CVD and renal function are also important, even though they are not the initial reason to use ULT. Gout is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD): patients with gout often have traditional risk factors for CVD, and patients with CVD often have gout. Also, tophi can sometimes form in coronary and carotid arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Both hyperuricaemia and gout are also independent risk factors for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. The exact mechanism for this is not yet known. Because high serum urate is associated with CVD, it seems logical that lowering serum urate would result in a reduced risk of CVD. Data however is conflicting: the FREED trial did show a reduction in CVD and in fact all-cause mortality when comparing febuxostat with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. On the other hand, in the large ALL-HEART study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], no protective effect of allopurinol compared to usual care was found in ischemic heart patients (without gout) with regard of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Complicating factor is that some data suggest that both starting and stopping ULT can indeed increase CVD risk. A subanalysis of the CARES study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] showed a mortality increase after the cessation of ULT and an observational cohort study showed increased cardiovascular morbidity after initiation and discontinuation of ULT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Based on the current evidence (and at the advice of our METC Oost-Nederland) taper schedules instead of direct withdrawal were implemented in the T2S ULT discontinuation group. Also, patients with severe heart failure and/or recent cardiovascular events were excluded from participation, since this group was also not included in the FAST and CARES study. It remains to be seen what the effect of ULT trial and error stopping means for cardiovascular risk and, as this strategy is widely used, any signal either detrimental or beneficial would be of great importance</p><p id="Par142">We chose a pragmatic approach with regard to tophaceous gout. Only if tophi are visible on physical examination at baseline, participants are excluded from participation, since the urate load has not been dissolved properly yet and it is expected that some local inflammation is present contributing to the risk of joint damage in this group. If tophi have been present in the past, but were absent for at least 12 months we deemed the urate load to be sufficiently lowered to be able to participate in the study.</p><p id="Par143">Another point to address is that our study is not blinded and/or placebo controlled. Blinding of participants and physicians would perhaps be ideal and would perhaps provide a better picture of the biological efficacy of the interventions under ideal conditions, and would reduce the chance of a false positive trial due to expectation bias as T2S patients who stop ULT might anticipate flares more strongly than continuing patients. Also, physicians might be more likely to restart ULT in case of a flare visit in the presence of elevated serum urate levels. However, we designed a pragmatic trial and focused on the question of which treatment strategy is most effective in daily clinical practice. Since, in daily practice, patients and physicians do know which strategy they follow, blinding patients could give a distorted picture of the (cost) effectiveness in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, arthritis is also objectively scored by the physician and is part of both the gout flare and preliminary gout remission criteria. Acute inflammatory gout is in general fairly distinguishable from non-inflammatory symptoms. Lasty, a blinded and placebo-controlled trial would be very complicated and unfeasible, as blinding of treatment would also require blinding of the serum urate levels, making tapering and restarting complex, perhaps almost impossible since you would want to see the lab results before prescribing anti-inflammatory medication. Also, three different types of ULT are included, with different dosages, which further complicates the use of a placebo. And finally, it would also result in a prohibitive cost increase.</p><p id="Par144">A final topic to discuss is the 2-year study duration. The choice for 2 years was based on previous research showing that most gout flares occur 1&#8211;4.5 years after ULT cessation. Therefore, a 2-year study would give a reasonable picture of whether T2T indeed has merit over T2S at least for this timeframe. However, an extension of up to 5 years is certainly desirable and is currently being designed since this would give a completer picture of flare rate over time in the T2S group and this would also provide more follow-time for adverse events.</p><p id="Par145">In conclusion, continued T2T and T2S discontinuation ULT strategies are both used in clinical practice, with their own possible pros and cons. Although continuing the T2T strategy lifelong is mostly thought to be superior to a T2S discontinuation strategy, this has not been determined before in gout patients in remission. This randomized superiority trial will add important and unique knowledge to deliver optimal gout care and will also gain insight into the association of ULT discontinuation and cardiovascular and renal events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par146">Recruitment started on 23 February 2021 and recruitment is still ongoing according to protocol version 11.0 23-01-2023.
