Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that pALG mainly influenced T cells and innate immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils). By analyzing immune cell subsets, we found that pALG moderately depleted CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, regulatory T cells, and NKT cells and mildly inhibited dendritic cells. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6) were only moderately increased compared with rATG, which might be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of untoward immune activation. During 3 months of follow-up, we found that all recipients and transplanted kidneys survived and showed good organ function recovery; there were no cases of rejection and a low rate of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In conclusion, pALG acts mainly by moderately depleting T cells and is thus a good candidate for induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients.

The development of immunosuppressant therapies has greatly improved organ and recipient survival (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, acute rejection (AR) and delayed graft function (DGF) remain treatment obstacles that impair KTx outcomes, especially in the current era of donation after circulatory death (DCD) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Induction therapy, based on the conventional triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, can reduce the incidence of postoperative AR and DGF, allow for reduced immunosuppressant doses, and prolong transplanted kidney and recipient survival (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To date, induction therapy has been used in the majority of recipients as a part of immunosuppressive protocol.</p><p>Induction therapy can be subdivided into two strategies involving either the use of non-lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibodies or lymphocyte-depleting polyclonal antibodies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The non-lymphocyte-depleting strategy is represented by the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist basiliximab, which inhibits lymphocyte proliferation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The lymphocyte-depleting strategy is represented by the rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG). In the current era of DCD, given the weaker immunosuppressive potency of non-depleting treatment compared to lymphocyte-depleting drugs, basiliximab use is limited to recipients at high risk of AR or DGF (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition, while the depleting rATG effectively inhibits the incidence of AR, it also increases the risks of corresponding complications such as lymphopenia and infection (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); however, little is known about its effects on the lymphocyte populations (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In addition to rATG, the porcine anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (pALG) is also a lymphocyte-depleting agent. pALG is produced by immunizing pigs with human-derived thymocytes. Unlike rATG which is made in rabbits, pALG origins are from a genetically closer species to humans and therefore improved antigenic similarity, which may result in weaker cytolytic capacity on human lymphocytes than rATG (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). pALG has been successfully used as first-line treatment in acquired severe aplastic anemia (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It has also been employed for other hematological indications such as graft versus host disease prophylaxis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Meanwhile, pALG has been used in transplantation including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and kidney transplantation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Pharmacokinetic studies show that, in humans, pALG reaches peak concentration immediately after administration and then markedly decreases over 2-3 months to undetectable levels (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, its immediate effects on the lymphocyte population remain unknown; such effects can directly influence the clinical course by affecting the propensity for AR, kidney function, inducing a cytokine storm, or inducing immunocompromise and facilitating the development of secondary infections during its period of physiological activity.</p><p>In this study, we retrospectively assessed a cohort of kidney recipients with organs from DCD donors who received induction therapy using pALG. The binding capability and the modulatory impact of pALG on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed, and the outcomes were tracked. Our work provides important data to optimize immunosuppressive protocols by considering individual patient variables in treatment planning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Study cohort</title><p>This retrospective study was designed to elucidate the impact of pALG on lymphocyte populations in kidney transplant recipients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: over 18 years of age; first-time KTx; negative PRA before transplantation; using a triple immunosuppressive regime as tacrolimus (Tac)+ mycophenolic acid (MPA)+prednisone. We excluded individuals with multiple organ transplantation; previous organ transplantation; or dual kidney transplantation. From March 2022 to September 2022, 12 KTx recipients with DCD kidneys were administered pALG as the induction therapy and enrolled in this study.

In the current DCD era, donor organs carry greater immunogenicity potential and are of lower quality; as such, lymphocyte-depleting antibody treatment has been extended to low-risk DCD recipients at relatively lower doses (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The optimal balance between treatment benefits (immunological and kidney protective) and risks (infections) of the typical lymphocyte-depleting antibody rATG still remains to be properly elucidated. pALG has been already used in the hematology and transplantation fields (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and offers an appropriate option to build an individualized induction therapy based on relevant immunological characteristics.</p><p>The first step toward elucidating the immunological characteristics of pALG is to determine its binding affinity to the target cells. In this study, we isolated PBMCs from 12 recipients who received pALG and used flow cytometry to test the binding affinity within one week of administration. The mean MFI values reached 191,457 at POD5. We also incubated serum pALG with PBMCs derived from healthy volunteers to examine its affinity potency, finding only a low MFI of 29,193 on POD3. We conclude that pALG has a high binding affinity to PBMCs and most pALG binds to its target PBMCs immediately after administration. This finding also indicates that continuous monitoring of pALG after the therapy is ceased imparts no clinical value.</p><p>The bound pALG should deplete the target cells, which can be measured directly by counting peripheral blood cell populations. To elucidate the lymphocyte depletion effects of pALG, matched recipients who received rATG, basiliximab, or no induction were also tested. We found that lymphocytes were markedly decreased immediately after pALG administration, while basiliximab exhibited only mild effects on lymphocyte numbers. Moreover, pALG showed a similar ability to deplete lymphocytes as rATG, but allowed a faster recovery after treatment cessation. Neutrophils, WBCs, and RBCs were also changed after transplantation, but this was most likely due to methylprednisolone and/or surgery-related factors rather than the induction therapy.</p><p>PBMCs and lymphocytes are complex cells with myriad subtypes. To further characterize the effect of pALG impact on immune cells, we conducted longitudinal single-cell sequencing of PBMCs that were derived from one pALG recipient. We found that T cells and innate immune cells (MPs and neutrophils) were most affected by pALG administration. PBMCs were then analyzed by flow cytometry. DCs showed a small decrease within 5 days and recovered by POD7, indicating that pALG may inhibit the initiation of immune responses by suppressing DC antigen presentation. T cells, including CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, Tregs, and even NKT cells all decreased significantly to their lowest level 3-5 days after pALG administration and then recovered gradually. We also found a modest increase in B cells, which indicates that pALG does not deplete this population. M&#981; and NK cells were increased on POD3 and then began to decline. Because pALG significantly depleted lymphocytes, the absolute number and proportion of neutrophils were increased within three days of surgery, which was followed by a slow decline after the cessation of pALG. Furthermore, Hassani M et&#160;al. found that low-density neutrophils were co-segregated with PBMCs from whole blood by Ficoll separation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, the neutrophils identified by single-cell sequencing analysis should be the low-density neutrophils. And the proportion of neutrophils in this study was consistent with previous study that the proportion of neutrophils in PBMCs of patients after kidney transplantation could reach 70% or even higher through the single-cell sequencing analysis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These differences in innate immune cells may reflect the complex post-operative immune changes that occur in response to the surgery, inflammation, and pALG administration. Taken together, pALG modulates the lymphocyte repertoire mainly by depleting T cells, which gradually recovers after drug cessation.</p><p>The use of lymphocyte-depleting antibodies can trigger hyperactive immune responses, which are sometimes termed &#8220;the cytokine storm&#8221;, due to strong lymphocytolysis. In this work, we used IL-2 and IL-6 as a proxy measure of lymphocytolysis and the development of a cytokine storm (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). pALG administration led to lower IL-2 (absolute) and IL-6 (relative) compared with rATG administration. However, because our groups showed markedly different baseline values of these cytokines, larger studies are needed to verify this potential safety advantage of pALG over rATG.</p><p>Knowing that pALG drops to undetectable levels within 2-3 months (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we conducted our observation over 3 months. Within the first week of administration, we tested the concentration kinetics, binding affinity, and lymphocyte populations. We also closely followed the clinical recovery of the cohort. Over the three months, we did not identify any cases of organ rejection and found a low rate of complications. sCr levels were found to gradually decrease and were maintained at &lt; 200 &#956;mol/L, and eGFR increased and maintained at approximately 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Based on previous experience with pALG, we administered it in five daily doses of 500mg each, from POD 0 to POD 4. Our immunological analyses and clinical outcome measures demonstrate that this protocol successfully balances treatment efficacy and patient safety. Our data suggest that our induction therapy strategy was appropriate. Although we aimed to elucidate the acute effects of pALG administration on immune cells, longer-term investigations are necessary and ongoing. In addition, due to the small sample size, there were no statistical differences among those groups for most of the parameters. Therefore, we will further expand the sample size in future studies to compare the effects between pALG and rATG or basiliximab.</p><p>In conclusion, pALG modulates lymphocytes mainly by a moderate T cell depletion effect. pALG can be used as induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients with high efficacy and safety. These immunological features of pALG treatment should inform the development of optimal and individualized induction therapies for patients according to their transplant and immune status needs, especially for non-high-risk recipients. The current cohort study should be followed-up by large sample, multi-center prospective studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data of single-cell sequencing presented in the study are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository, accession number <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-geo" xlink:href="GSE226328">GSE226328</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
