Baseline demographic and cardiovascular characteristics of the study population were stratified by age at initial evaluation (&lt;50, 50&#8211;65, 65&#8211;80, and &gt;80 years). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate hospitalization-free survival for each cardiovascular outcome. A Cox proportional multivariable hazard model was used to examine independent predictors of all-cause mortality in patients aged &lt;65 years using a stepwise selection approach with the baseline visit used as time 0. Mortality analysis was performed utilizing adjustment for all relevant confounding clinical covariates. Any significant 2-way interaction of age with other covariates was tested and incorporated into the final model. Sensitivity analysis was performed in 4 subsets: model 1: excluding patients with valvular AF (history of mitral valve disorder or mitral valve surgery); model 2: excluding patients with prior AF-related interventions: prior pulmonary vein ablation or prior atrioventricular node ablation, prior cardioversions, or prior maze surgery; model 3: excluding patients with prior cancer history; and model 4 (most restrictive) excluding all those in above models.

We also show that the presence of AF in patients aged &lt;65 years confers long-term mortality risk that is higher than a standard age- and sex-matched US reference population. Additionally, patients with AF aged &lt;65 years experience significantly worse survival than age- and sex-matched patients without AF.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>RFs in Patients With AF Aged &lt;65 Years</title><p>In our study, a significant burden of AF RFs was notable in patients aged &lt;65 years especially regarding obesity (&gt;18% with body mass index &gt;40), smoking, and cardiovascular RFs, including hypertension and diabetes. Although population-based nationwide cohort studies<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> report favorable RF profiles in younger patients with AF with low frequencies of hypertension, HF, and obesity, data from other epidemiological cohorts suggest that these RFs are increasingly prevalent.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> All these RFs result in a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> peripheral vascular disease, and HF<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> in these patients with long-term structural, electrical, and autonomic changes influencing not only morbidity and mortality but also downstream health care utilization. Although studies document a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with AF,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> its implications in young patients with AF regarding cardiovascular outcomes and mortality are unclear and need investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Mortality and Hospitalization in Patients With AF Aged &lt;65 Years</title><p>AF is associated with increased all-cause mortality in multiple cohort studies.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, these data are skewed towards older patients and come from studies focused on specific populations (HF, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, post&#8211;myocardial infarction, postrevascularization, poststroke, and aortic stenosis) with most evaluating incident AF and not prevalent AF.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Little data exist on the long-term survival of contemporary patients with AF from studies focused on the younger population. Our comparative data suggest that younger patients with AF are at higher risk of mortality and hospitalization with higher hazard noted with progressively younger age compared with those without AF.</p><p>The results of our study contrast with estimates from other population-based nationwide European cohorts<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and underscore the burden of cardiovascular RFs prevalent in the US population, especially among the younger patients with AF seeking care within a hospital system. The longitudinal course in terms of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF is well described in those aged &gt;65 years.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In our cohort, the presence of hypertension in combination with HF is of particular importance as a driver of adverse outcomes among young adults substantiating subtle signals from prior reports.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes may be associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with early-onset AF,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the likely complex interplay between predisposing variants and lifestyle-based RFs warrants evaluation with future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for Clinical Practice</title><p>The results of our study suggest that management of patients with AF aged &lt;65 years must be in the context of their individual RF burden and lifestyle modification with an appropriate focus on noncardiac RFs consistent with recent scientific statements.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Apart from aggressive management of hypertension, vascular disease, diabetes, and HF, focus on smoking cessation with support and counseling along with the incorporation of a goal-directed weight-reduction plan may influence not only AF burden<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> but also mortality and hospitalization. An integrated multidisciplinary team&#8211;based approach<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> may improve outcomes when a plethora of RFs need to be addressed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>This study has several limitations. All the biases and limitations inherent to a retrospective observational study exist particularly when large electronic health records and administrative heath system&#8211;wide data are utilized using the <italic toggle="yes">ICD</italic> coding system. Nonetheless, we defined variables a priori, tested the robustness of results through sensitivity analysis, and made adjustments for all available RFs. We did not measure quality of life metrics nor was the cause of death ascertained. We also did not have information on alcohol consumption that could modify some of the existing relationships. However, the large number of patients in our study treated across multiple levels of a hospital system allows for a likely representative assessment of the RF burden and its impact on patients with AF aged &lt;65 years.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE INFORMATION</title><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>The article publication fee was paid using UPMC HVI seed account FBS2512087.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Dr Estes serves as a consultant for Medtronic, Abbott, and Boston Scientific.
