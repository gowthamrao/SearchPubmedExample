This behaviour not only increases the risk of medical comorbidities associated with smoking, but it can also interfere with treatment and ultimately worsen prognosis. This study aims to determine if nicotine use affects the cumulative number of psychiatric hospitalisations in patients with schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is a retrospective cohort study using 2018&#8211;2023 electronic medical record data.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Data was collected at an inpatient psychiatric hospital in Central California.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>There were a total of 825 patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were admitted to the mental health hospital between 2018 and 2023.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome of interest was the number of psychiatric hospitalisations observed among the patients who were smokers versus those who were non-smokers.

Accounting for matching, patients who smoked had significantly (p&lt;0.01) more hospitalisations (mean hospitalisations=2.55, SD=2.81) than patients who never smoked (mean hospitalisations=1.64, SD=1.64), even after controlling for covariates.

The presence of smoking in this population is high, estimated to be around 70%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than in the general population.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Consequently, individuals with schizophrenia experience a disproportionate burden of smoking-related illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses and various cancers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Despite the established link between smoking and schizophrenia, few studies have examined specific outcomes associated with smoking in this population. There has been research on the relationship between smoking and cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia, but the results are mixed. While earlier studies have suggested that smoking may improve cognitive performance, more recent data have demonstrated that chronic smoking is associated with impairments in attention, working memory, processing speed and executive functioning among individuals with schizophrenia.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4 5</sup></xref> Other studies have found that smokers with schizophrenia tend to have more severe psychopathology compared with non-smokers.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A cross-sectional study found that smokers were more likely to be unemployed and had higher scores on the positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Understanding the impact of smoking on patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder is crucial for elucidating disease trajectories and identifying potential interventions to reduce adverse outcomes.</p><p>In this retrospective cohort analysis, we aim to investigate the influence of smoking on the cumulative number of psychiatric hospitalisations among patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, we seek to explore the disease course and medical comorbidities associated with smoking in this population. By examining medical comorbidities in conjunction with smoking behaviour, we can gain deeper insights into the health implications of tobacco use in this vulnerable population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective cohort study approved by an Institutional Review Board. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) at a public mental health hospital in rural Central California without smoking privileges. Referrals to this facility were initiated by crisis workers and psychiatrists at local medical hospitals and crisis stabilisation centres. All admissions were involuntary. 1866 patients aged 18 years and older were admitted to the psychiatric hospital from June 2018 to June 2023. These patients carried a vast array of diagnoses, including different kinds of mood disorders and psychotic disorders. Individuals who had at least one visit due to either schizoaffective disorder (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code F25*) or schizophrenia (ICD-10 code F20*) were included in the study. Such a visit was defined as an index visit, representing the first admission within the study period, and individuals were tracked afterwards. As a result, 825 individuals were selected for the study (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Both schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder diagnoses were included in the sample to represent the population of patients with chronic psychosis. Additionally, patients at the facility where the study was conducted frequently received a diagnosis of schizophrenia during one visit and schizoaffective disorder during another, reflecting common diagnostic changes made by providers over time. ICD-10 codes were used to select the sample, as these codes represent how patient diagnoses were recorded in the EMR system. These diagnoses were established at discharge.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sampling flowchart.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="bmjopen-15-7-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>The independent variable of focus was nicotine dependence. Individuals in the sample with a lifetime history of nicotine dependence, identified by at least one visit containing ICD-10 code F17* during the study period, were categorised into the &#8216;smoker&#8217; group. All other individuals in the sample were categorised into the &#8216;non-smoker&#8217; group. Lifetime nicotine dependence was used as a measure of smoker status rather than smoking status at the time of admission because nicotine use disorders are often neglected to be included as a diagnosis during inpatient psychiatric admissions at the institution where this study took place. The primary outcome of interest was the cumulative number of &#8216;visits&#8217;, or psychiatric hospitalisations, during the designated time interval. Our secondary objective was to determine the prevalence of certain medical comorbidities among the &#8216;smoker&#8217; and &#8216;non-smoker&#8217; groups.</p><p>Several covariates were identified that could potentially confound the relationship between smoking and psychiatric hospitalisations: sex (male or female), age, ethnicity (non-Hispanic, Hispanic or unknown), insurance status, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and medical comorbidities.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7 8</sup></xref> Insurance status was used as a proxy variable for socioeconomic status and included self-pay, private insurance, Medicare, Medi-Cal, multiple or unknown. Borderline personality disorder and anxiety were included as covariates because they are highly comorbid in the psychiatric inpatient setting and may be implicated in increased readmission rates.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Given that medical comorbidities are associated with increased risk of psychiatric hospital readmission, we included several of the most common chronic conditions observed in psychiatric populations as covariates: hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type II diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>One-to-one propensity score matching was used to match smokers with non-smokers on sample characteristics to reduce selection bias. One-fourth of the SD of the propensity score was used as a calliper for matching.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Differences between smokers and non-smokers were evaluated using &#967;&#178; tests for categorical demographics and two-sample t-tests for continuous demographics, in both the full and matched samples. Because the outcome measure, the number of visits, is right-skewed and the mean is approximate to the SD, Poisson regression models were performed to examine the association of smoking with the number of visits while controlling for covariates. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software Stata V.18.0.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 825 subjects in the sample, 56.3% (n=465) were male, 46.8% (n=386) were non-Hispanic and 69.1% (n=570) had Medi-Cal insurance. 60.7% (n=501) of the sample had a lifetime history of nicotine dependence. Smokers were older than non-smokers (p=0.006) and were more likely to be male (p=0.001) and non-Hispanic (p=0.001). They were also more likely to experience anxiety (p=0.002).

Results show that a statistically significant association was found between smoking and number of visits among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.

After matching, no difference was found between the groups (see <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings reveal a high prevalence of smoking among patients with psychotic disorders, which is consistent with the literature. There are multiple explanations for this: patients smoke in an attempt to alleviate severe psychosis, to cope with the stress from psychosis, and smoking interacts with the metabolism of psychotropic medications leading to decompensating symptoms.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>Whatever the reason for the relationship between smoking and patients with schizophrenia, multiple studies have consistently demonstrated poor outcomes by using tools such as the PANSS and self-rating questionnaires. One study used a self-reported Reasons for Smoking Questionnaire in patients with a psychotic disorder and found this population smoked because it provided them with energy, weight control and/or improved concentration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> These researchers further discovered that this set of patients was less likely to remain abstinent from smoking, was associated with more psychological symptoms and had a lower global assessment of functioning. Another study in patients with non-affective psychosis (n=1094) demonstrated an increase in subjective psychotic symptoms among patients who smoke, using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experience.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Although smoking is generally associated with poorer clinical outcomes, it has been hypothesised that smoking may have a mitigating effect on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, potentially through nicotine&#8217;s action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Furthermore, smoking has been proposed to alleviate certain side effects of antipsychotic medications, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, possibly by modulating dopaminergic neurotransmission.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Building on the existing literature, our study used the number of psychiatric hospitalisations to provide a tangible measure that could further detail these poor outcomes associated with smoking in patients with psychosis.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that nicotine dependence was associated with psychiatric hospitalisations, suggesting exacerbated symptomatology within the smoking group. This could be explained biochemically by examining nicotine&#8217;s effect on dopamine pathways classically associated with positive psychotic symptoms, namely the mesolimbic pathway.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Nicotine activates B2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the ventral tegmental area, enhancing dopamine excitation and leading to excessive dopamine in the ventral striatum.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> This pathway is pertinent to reward and reinforcement in nicotine dependence. However, in patients with schizophrenia who theoretically already have excess dopamine in this area, enhancing dopamine release through nicotine could further exacerbate symptoms and thereby lead to more hospitalisations.</p><p>Moreover, the interaction between smoking and psychotropic medication metabolism could also contribute to symptomatic decompensation and subsequent rehospitalisation. A meta-analysis investigating the effects of smoking showed that the concentration-to-dose ratio of both olanzapine and clozapine was significantly lower in smokers than in non-smokers.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> This effect is likely due to the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke which are believed to induce cytochrome P450, particularly CYP1A2, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of clozapine and olanzapine.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Additionally, our investigation into comorbid medical conditions uncovered a higher prevalence within the smoking group. It is well established that patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of premature death. A retrospective cohort study investigating premature mortality among adults with schizophrenia found a death rate that is approximately 3.5 times higher than that of the general population. The investigators also revealed that patients with schizophrenia who smoke have high mortality rates for COPD and are at increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, thereby implicating smoking as a major risk factor for premature death in schizophrenia.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> This further emphasises the importance of screening and treating concomitant smoking in patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>The main strengths of our study include its large sample size, the use of two comparison groups with several covariates and the utilisation of matching in conjunction with regression analysis. While leveraging electronic health records allowed for real-world, longitudinal data capture and enhanced the generalisability of our findings, causation cannot be inferred from this observational method as it could be in a randomised controlled trial.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20 21</sup></xref> Several other limitations should be acknowledged. First, comorbid substance use was not included as a covariate, despite its influence on both nicotine use and psychiatric hospitalisations. Research suggests that smoking cessation is associated with improvements in other substance use disorders, which may affect rehospitalisation rates.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Second, lifetime smoking history was used as an indicator of smoker status rather than current smoking at the time of hospitalisation, which may weaken the observed association. However, smoking status is variable in patients&#8217; reports and is difficult to verify. Smoking behaviour is also inconsistently documented in the EMR, introducing potential misclassification bias. Moreover, smokers who did not meet clinical criteria for nicotine dependence were not captured, although smoking, irrespective of dependence, may still adversely impact health outcomes, potentially leading to an underestimation of smoking-related risks. Certain key covariates affecting rehospitalisation rates beyond comorbid substance use disorders were also not accounted for. These include patients&#8217; housing situations at discharge (eg, shelters, supported housing or tertiary care settings), the type of antipsychotic prescribed (long-acting injectable vs oral formulations) and the influence of smoking on the metabolism of certain prescribed antipsychotics through induction of CYP1A2 enzymes as discussed earlier. Lastly, our sample population was not as diverse in terms of ethnicity given that the source population the sample was pooled from had a lower prevalence of black and Asian individuals, which can limit external validity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, smoking was associated with increased psychiatric hospitalisations. Based on recent studies, this could be due to the augmentative effect of smoking on psychotic symptoms. Our study highlights the importance of both assessing for nicotine use and developing interventions to combat nicotine dependence, such as providing smoking cessation education, pharmacotherapy and nicotine replacement therapy. These interventions can improve outcomes not only in psychiatric morbidity but also in medical conditions. Future research should further explore additional factors that may influence rehospitalisation rates for patients with schizophrenia who smoke, including the length of hospitalisation, which may reflect illness severity, and the types of antipsychotic medications prescribed prior to admission, as different agents and formulations (eg, long-acting injectables vs oral antipsychotics) may have varying effects on relapse risk. Addressing these variables will improve understanding of the broader determinants of hospitalisation outcomes for this population. Ultimately, our findings have the potential to guide clinical practice and public health efforts aimed at addressing the complex interplay between smoking behaviour, psychiatric symptoms and overall health outcomes in individuals with psychotic disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092122</object-id><label>online supplemental file 1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-15-7-s001.docx" id="d67e593" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SP2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2024-092122</object-id><label>online supplemental file 2</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-15-7-s002.docx" id="d67e598" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Chris Patty and Jennifer Halsey for their contributions to the study.
