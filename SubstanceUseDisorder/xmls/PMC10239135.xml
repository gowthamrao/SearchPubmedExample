Included studies showed substantial variation in the assessment methods of physical activity and in type of costs included. Overall, studies showed that physical inactivity is related to higher healthcare costs.

No study included healthcare costs for physical-activity-related injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Physical inactivity is associated with higher healthcare costs in the general population in the short-term. However, in the long-term aversion of diseases related with physical inactivity may increase longevity and, as a consequence, healthcare costs in life-years gained. Future studies should use a broad definition of costs, including costs in life-years gained and costs related to physical-activity-related injuries.

According to the global physical activity guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), adults should engage in at least 150&#160;min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or 75&#160;min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Not adhering to these recommendations increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast- and colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, performing at least some physical activity has already been associated with improved health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Next to averting disease, physical activity contributes to other aspects of health, for example a person&#8217;s well-being and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">At the same time, healthcare costs are rising due to new technological possibilities, including expensive pharmaceuticals, increases in wages and prices and an ageing population. One other element in rising healthcare costs may be that unhealthy lifestyles, such as physical inactivity, may be associated with increased healthcare expenses. One global study showed the economic burden of physical inactivity to be substantial, especially in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The impact of physical inactivity on healthcare costs may be twofold. On the one hand, when physical activity levels increase, physical-inactivity-related disease incidence declines, with associated lowering effects on healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A review by Ding et al. (2017) focused on this aspect when assessing the economic burden of physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, reduced incidence of diseases associated with inactivity may extend people&#8217;s lives. As was shown in studies on obesity and smoking, improved lifestyle indeed reduced healthcare costs of diseases related to unhealthy lifestyles, but increased costs for unrelated diseases at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A similar effect on healthcare costs of prolonged life could exist when physical inactivity would be reduced. For example, when living longer chances increase to ever need expensive nursing home care due to Alzheimer disease. Therefore, costs of healthcare resources used later in life should be taken into account in (reviews of) costing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, improving physical activity levels could be accompanied with an increase in related injuries and contribute to healthcare costs as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These costs of physical activity related injuries were ignored in existing reviews on the relationship between physical inactivity and healthcare expenses. Hence, the association between physical inactivity and healthcare costs is not straightforward and may both be negatively and positively impacted by increased physical activity.</p><p id="Par8">The aim of this systematic review is to describe the association between physical activity and healthcare costs, by not only taking into account healthcare costs of physical-inactivity-related diseases, but also extend to physical-activity-related injuries and healthcare resources used in life-years gained. The combination of these three aspects of healthcare costs related to physical activity has not been investigated before in a systematic review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources and search strategy</title><p id="Par9">Peer-reviewed articles written in English or Dutch and published between 2010 and April 2020 were identified through both the EMBASE database and in references of eligible articles.

First, an econometric approach: data on physical inactivity and healthcare expenditure was combined at the individual level, thereby enabling a comparison of healthcare costs between physically active and inactive groups. Second, a population attributable fraction or PAF-based approach: healthcare costs attributable to physical inactivity were based on a combination of physical-inactivity-related health conditions and physical inactivity prevalence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With the PAF-based approach the proportion of disease that would not exist if physical inactivity was eliminated or reduced was estimated.</p><p id="Par20">With regard to physical activity, information on the definition of sufficient physical activity and the physical activity assessment tool was extracted. For PAF-based approach studies, the prevalence estimates of physical inactivity were extracted. Studies applied different definitions of being considered sufficiently physical active. These definitions were expressed in terms of time spent on moderate to vigorous intensity activities (e.g. &#8216;perform physical activity once a week&#8217; or &#8216;adhere to WHO guidelines&#8217;) or based on energy expenditure in terms of calories per day. With respect to the wide range of definitions for physical (in)activity, comparisons were made between studies with similar definitions of sufficient physical activity. To do so, a predefined three-level scale was defined for level of comparison (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), based on the WHO guidelines (150&#160;min of at least moderate intense activity and/or 75&#160;min of vigorous intense activity): A) &#8216;inactive vs. active according to the WHO guidelines&#8217;, B) &#8216;inactive vs. at least some physical activity&#8217; or C) &#8216;inactive or at least some physical activity vs. adhering to the WHO guidelines&#8217;. By allocating the studies to the three comparison levels, individual study outcomes could be placed in perspective of the definition of sufficient physical activity used. A few econometric approach studies could be allocated to more than one category. For those studies, using data from one underlying population, results were not presented for all possible categories, to maintain equal weight of all studies in the aggregated results. In this case, results were presented for category B (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as the majority of the econometric studies could be allocated to this comparison.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Categorization of studies to comparison <bold>A</bold>,<bold> B</bold> or <bold>C</bold> based on definition of sufficient physical activity applied. <italic toggle="yes">WHO recommendations: engaging in at least 150&#160;min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week and/or 75&#160;min of vigorous-intensity activity</italic></p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12913_2023_9556_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">The outcome variable of interest for the included studies was healthcare costs.

For studies with an econometric approach, additional methodological information was extracted on study design, sample size, age of population, adjustment for covariates and type of healthcare costs included. For PAF-based approach studies, additional information was extracted on health conditions included, use of crude risk ratios or adjusted risk ratios for confounders, correcting for comorbidities, applied scenario of becoming sufficiently physical active when calculating costs and whether healthcare costs related to improved life expectancy in the long-term was taken into account. For both types of studies the source of funding and possible conflict of interests were extracted as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data synthesis</title><p id="Par22">Study characteristics of selected studies were summarized in an extraction sheet in Excel (Tables&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

To compare study outcomes, the percentage of total healthcare costs attributable to physical inactivity was extracted. For PAF-based approach studies, this percentage was either extracted from the study directly, or calculated based on information available in the study (for example: (the difference in healthcare costs between inactive group and active group divided by healthcare costs of inactive group)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;100%)).

One of these studies found no association between physical inactivity and healthcare costs when perceived health was taking into account as a covariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Next to that, three econometric studies calculated healthcare costs related to an extra proportion of the population becoming sufficiently active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and one estimated costs as percentage of the country&#8217;s GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These four studies also showed that a proportion of total healthcare costs can be attributed to physical inactivity, the studies will be described one by one. De Boer et al. (2020) calculated the percentage of total healthcare costs at national level that could be saved if an extra percentage of the population would adhere to WHO guidelines. They estimated that with each 1% increase in adherence to the guidelines, 0.4% of the total population&#8217;s healthcare costs could be saved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Aoyagi et al. (2011) used a similar approach. Instead of using the difference in healthcare costs between groups they used healthcare expenditure data based on health conditions related to physical inactivity. They concluded that if 5% of the currently inactive population would become sufficiently active, 3.7% of healthcare expenditure on health conditions related to physical inactivity could be averted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Sato et al. (2020) were the only ones to report on the healthcare costs with a time lag between risk factor and healthcare costs, they concluded that if 10% of the population would become sufficiently active, after 2&#160;years 0.4% and after 3&#160;years 1.0% of total healthcare cost could be averted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Covariates adjusted for in econometric studies varied (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">PAF-based approach studies showed that 0.4% to 4.6% of total healthcare costs could be attributed to physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In these studies, a scenario was applied that the whole population would need to become sufficiently active to avert the calculated costs. One of these studies, Amarasinghe (2010), assessed a scenario in which 10% of the population would become more active, resulting in 0.9% less healthcare expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Difference in study findings can be attributed to differences in included health conditions, physical activity definition and in physical inactivity prevalence rates. One study adjusted for possible comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The majority of the studies used crude risk ratios in the calculation and several studies applied adjusted risk ratios for confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. No clear distinction in healthcare costs was found between these two methodological approaches. A small difference in costs is seen between the five studies including four to five common health conditions (0.4%-1.8% of healthcare costs attributable to physical inactivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and the studies including additional diseases, reporting percentages of 0.9%-4.6% of healthcare costs being attributable to physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cost of physical activity related injuries</title><p id="Par32">None of the studies included in our review combined healthcare costs related to physical- activity-injuries with healthcare costs of physical-inactivity-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Healthcare costs in life-years gained</title><p id="Par33">Only one study considered the healthcare costs associated with additional life-years as a consequence of being more physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Hence, the net effect on healthcare costs was found to be negative when the positive effect of physical activity on life-expectancy was included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Quality assessment of studies included in our review</title><p id="Par34">Studies reported &#8216;yes&#8217; on 13 to 17 items out of 17, 18 or 19 applicable items of the &#8220;Checklist for reporting estimates of the economic costs/burden of risk factors&#8221; (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Eleven studies did not report on a sensitivity analysis (item 16) and nine studies did not elaborate on relevant aspects of the healthcare system in which decisions needed to be made (item 5).

Next to including healthcare costs of diseases directly related to physical inactivity, costs of physical-activity-related injuries and healthcare costs in life years gained were included in this study, as advised by many health economists, and Dutch and US guidelines for costing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the aim of the study was novel, this study revealed that most studies on the relationship between physical inactivity and healthcare costs adopted a limited perspective on healthcare costs, by only including healthcare costs directly relating to physical inactivity. Similar to previous literature our findings showed that physical activity could reduce physical-inactivity-related healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A strength of the study is the broader definition of healthcare costs related to physical inactivity. Although this broader definition, including costs in life years gained, has been adopted in other fields of disease prevention (e.g. obesity, smoking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this study is the first review to include these future medical costs in relation to physical inactivity. Indeed, the single study in this review that did include these future costs showed that the use of healthcare resources in increased life-years do increase overall cost estimates.</p><p id="Par37">There are some limitations of the current review that should be considered. First, in the literature search a narrow time-frame of 10&#160;years was used (2010&#8211;2019). The reason for this time-frame was to include the most recent literature (as over time previous studies were updated and studies often reported on healthcare costs of several years before publication date). Publications from before 2010 were considered to provide outdated information on healthcare costs. Nevertheless, a previous review by Ding et al. (2017) on the economic burden of physical inactivity that did include studies published before 2010 came to comparable conclusions for proportion of healthcare costs attributable to physical inactivity based on PAF based studies (0.3%-4.6% vs. 0.4%-4.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Second, the search was conducted in only one database, EMBASE, thereby possibly missing relevant studies. However, EMBASE is considered to be an up-to-date date source on biomedical research and covers the most important international biomedical literature. Next to that, the review of Ding et al. (2017) was screened for additional eligible articles. This revealed only one new peer-reviewed article and two grey literature publications that met our inclusion criteria (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Last, in this study information on physical activity and related healthcare costs was dichotomized by categorizing studies based on the study&#8217;s definition of sufficient physical activity. We acknowledge that some information could get lost following this approach. For example, for category B (inactive&#8201;+&#8201;some activity vs. WHO guideline) it implicitly is assumed that performing only some physical activity does not contribute to health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thereby, the presented healthcare costs might be an underestimation of the true effects of physical inactivity. Another reason for an underestimation is that savings or reductions in health costs associated with therapies derived from physical activity were not included in the current study. After all, physical activity has an inverse dose&#8211;response relationship with mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">With an increase of the population&#8217;s physical activity level, it is likely that the incidence of physical-activity-related injuries increases as well (e.g. cycle injuries during active transport, sport injuries). Unfortunately, based on the inclusion criteria of this review no study could be included that mentioned to have considered costs related to physical activity injuries. A report that studied healthcare costs of sport injuries in relation to healthcare costs for physical-inactivity-related disease concluded that for adults aged 25 to 54&#160;years costs for sport injuries (500&#8211;800 Euro per person) did not outweigh healthcare cost related to averting physical-inactivity-related diseases (1500&#8211;6000 Euro per person), showing that net healthcare costs are not higher for active individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It should be acknowledged that some studies in our review implicitly included healthcare costs for physical-activity-related injuries as they compared all healthcare costs between inactive and active groups. These studies reported lower healthcare costs for physically active groups, despite the inclusion of physical-activity-related injuries. Moreover, physical-activity-related injuries can differ in seriousness and can have a short-term (e.g. sprain ankle) or long-term (e.g. arthrosis) character, with a varying impact on healthcare costs. To date, research on quantifying healthcare costs of physical-activity-related-injuries is limited. Therefore, more research is needed to include this aspect in calculations of healthcare costs related to physical activity.</p><p id="Par41">A fair comparison of results between studies depends on the comparability of methods. Methods of studies included in this review vary, for example with regard to age group included, number and type of diseases included, type of healthcare costs included, data sources and definition of physical activity. In the current review, it was not possible to draw conclusions on whether differences between study findings could have been due to a variation in the applied definition of physical activity. Moreover, a variety of measurement tools was used to assess physical activity (e.g. validated and unvalidated question(naires), accelerometry). Furthermore, self-reported data is known to result in overestimation of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Also, included studies often failed to correct for comorbidities which could result in an overestimation of healthcare costs. Additionally, overestimation could have been the case for several econometric approach studies included in this review. The study populations of several studies often consisted of elderly samples, for whom physical-inactivity-related diseases are more likely to occur. This illustrates the importance of proper reporting on methodological features, key assumptions and limitations, and to enable harmonization based on output. Similarly, as argued by Ding et al. (2017), future studies should preferably use a checklist for reporting estimates of the economic costs/burden of risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Findings in this review are mostly based on cross-sectional data and do not give information about long-term physical (in)activity behavior, which plays an important role in relation to healthcare costs. To fully understand this relation, information from a life-time perspective is required. Even though conducting longitudinal studies could be difficult and time demanding, it is needed to derive more accurate estimates of changes in physical activity behavior and subsequent changes in healthcare costs.</p><p id="Par43">The current review focused on healthcare cost related to physical activity, ignoring wider societal costs, which are advised to include by many guidelines for health economic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For instance, active individuals show less work absenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In addition, active individuals may also contribute to informal caregiving more often than inactive persons. Moreover, from a societal perspective, physical activity positively contributes to a person&#8217;s well-being and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the same time, productivity of active individuals may be impacted by sports injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Therefore, total societal costs and benefits of enhanced physical activity could be larger than found in this study. Future health economic studies should preferably make an effort to adopt this broader societal perspective.</p><p id="Par44">Results of this literature review may give insight in the net-effect of physical activity on healthcare costs, which is of importance for knowledge based public health policy. Moreover, the results could encourage public health policy to keep striving for a physically active population, as this may result in reduced healthcare costs in the short-term, next to apparent health effects of physical activity. These insights can add to the justification of policy decisions on (further) investments in physical activity and sports. Additionally, we encourage research institutes outside of academia to publish their study results more often in scientific journals, next to publishing standard reports&#8217; in their mother tongue, thereby, enhancing the body of research in the field of physical inactivity and health economics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">Similar to previous research, this review concluded that increasing physical activity is associated with lower healthcare costs in a general population in the short-term. Although studies were difficult to compare due to different methods, the majority of the studies showed physically active populations to have lower healthcare costs. However, this review is the first review to have included future medical costs, suggesting that healthcare costs in the long run may increase in a more physically active population. No studies that included costs of physical-activity-related injuries were found. Future research should focus on combining all healthcare costs, both positively and negatively associated with physical inactivity. In addition, studies may adopt a societal perspective instead of the healthcare perspective by including absenteeism costs related to physical inactivity and physical-activity-injuries. Thereby, future studies may provide a more comprehensive picture of economic benefits of physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
