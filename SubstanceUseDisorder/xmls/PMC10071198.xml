arthroplasty (THA), particularly if they intend to resume dancing as
performers or teachers.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>To report clinical outcomes and return to dance after THA with a
muscle-sparing direct anterior approach using a custom femoral stem in a
cohort of current or former professional ballet dancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Twenty-three patients (26 hips) were included, that identified as current or
former professional ballet dancers, from a consecutive series of 1699 hips
that underwent primary THA by 1 of 2 surgeons. Both surgeons routinely
implanted custom femoral stems using a muscle-sparing direct anterior
approach in active and/or high-demand patients. All patients completed a
questionnaire postoperatively that assessed dance capabilities, the visual
analog scale (VAS) for hip pain (0-10), the VAS for satisfaction with
surgery (0-10), the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and the Forgotten Joint Score
(FJS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The initial cohort comprised 19 women and 4 men, with a mean age of 50.5 &#177;
14.9 years and a mean 38.0 &#177; 14.4 years of dance experience. One patient
underwent revision THA for a leg-length discrepancy, leaving 22 patients (25
hips) with a mean follow-up of 3.4 &#177; 1.4 years. The mean VAS satisfaction
score was 9.8 &#177; 0.6, and the mean VAS pain score was 0.5 &#177; 1.0. The
postoperative OHS and FJS were 46 &#177; 2 and 92 &#177; 15, respectively. Overall, 16
patients resumed ballet at 5.1 &#177; 3.9 months, 3 resumed other types of dance,
and 3 did not resume any type of dance. None of the 6 patients who did not
resume ballet indicated pain in the operated hip as the reason for
stopping.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In current or former professional ballet dancers, THA by a muscle-sparing
direct anterior approach using a custom femoral stem yielded excellent
clinical outcomes at a minimum of 2 years, with the highest satisfaction
score of 10 points reported for 88% of hips and 72% of hips being totally
pain free. Furthermore, 73% of patients resumed ballet, and 86% resumed
dance in general.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>total hip arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>custom femoral stem</kwd><kwd>professional ballet dancer</kwd><kwd>direct anterior approach</kwd><kwd>clinical outcomes</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Professional dancers spend many hours training during their childhood and early adulthood,<sup>

</sup> exposing their lower limbs to intense repetitive loading and extreme range of
motion (ROM). The prevalence of joint injuries in professional dancers is greater than
in the general population, which could make them more susceptible to requiring
arthroplasty at a younger age.<sup>

</p><p>In contrast to the general population, professional dancers have high expectations after
total hip arthroplasty (THA), particularly ballet dancers, for whom the recuperation of
ROM can be of paramount importance.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> Custom femoral stems may be advantageous over off-the-shelf stems because they
facilitate an accurate restoration of 3-dimensional (3D) extramedullary hip
architecture, notably femoral offset and femoral anteversion, which can improve ROM;
furthermore, they maximize metaphyseal fit and fill, thereby increasing both rotational
and axial stability.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> In addition, a recent systematic review showed that custom stems provide good
clinical outcomes, low complication rates, and excellent survival.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>In our experience, ballet dancers are reluctant to undergo THA if they know of peers who
had disappointing outcomes. This may explain why there are only 4 published studies
presenting the outcomes of dancers after THA, which further indicate the rarity of this
type of surgery for this high-demand population. It is also possible that very few
dancers need THA, making it difficult to study a large-sized cohort. Buyls et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> reported pain relief and return to dance in 9 dancers, without specifying the THA
surgical approach used; however, most were disappointed with the prolonged
rehabilitation period. Komiyama et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> reported on 2 recreational dancers who underwent surgery via a posterolateral
approach and were satisfied with their ability to return to dance, with both able to
perform complex ranges of hip movements and activity-dependent kinematics. Mizoguchi et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> reported on an experienced jazz dance instructor who underwent simultaneous
bilateral THA using a transtrochanteric approach and the tailored postoperative physical
therapy program that she followed. Morio et al<sup>

</sup> reported on a retired professional ballet dancer who underwent bilateral THA and
was able to regain most of her prearthritic ROM, being able to perform the split
position.</p><p>For the past decade, we have routinely implanted a custom femoral stem by a
muscle-sparing direct anterior approach in all active and/or high-demand patients
requiring THA. The purpose of the present study was to report clinical outcomes and
return to dance after THA by a muscle-sparing direct anterior approach using a custom
femoral stem in a cohort of current or former professional ballet dancers.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-23259671231155143"><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1699 consecutive hips that underwent
primary THA, operated under the care of 2 senior surgeons (A.N., I.T.) between June
1, 2014, and October 31, 2019. Patients were included in the study if they had
undergone primary THA by a direct anterior approach using custom femoral stems.
Patients were excluded from the study if they were neither current nor former
professional ballet dancers. During this time period, the surgeons systematically
implanted a custom femoral stem by a muscle-sparing direct anterior approach in all
active and/or high-demand patients (1207 hips); otherwise, they implanted a standard
femoral stem also by a muscle-sparing direct anterior approach in inactive and/or
elderly patients (492 hips). All patients were asked to indicate their current
profession and sports activities. A total of 60 patients (69 hips; 4.1%) indicated
dance as a profession or sports activity, of which 23 patients (26 hips; 1.5%) were
current or former professional ballet dancers (<xref rid="fig1-23259671231155143" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The protocol for this study

progressively to recover full ROM in all directions; if needed, pain was managed
with massages, ice treatment, analgesics, and ultrasound/Tecar therapy. Soon
afterward, active nonweightbearing rehabilitation was initiated, adapted to the
level of pain; this included cardiovascular training on cycling machines as well
as muscle strengthening and full-body conditioning (hip, foot, ankle, core, and
upper limbs if needed). After 4 to 6 weeks, active progressive weightbearing
rehabilitation was started for global strengthening and proprioception. After 8
weeks, functional training specific to ballet was initiated, including static

After 16 weeks, active dancing, including turning and jumping, as well as
performing were allowed if the following criteria were met: (1) pain free; (2)
symmetric ROM (with no limitations); (3) symmetric isokinetic muscle strength
(maximum 15% difference in dynamometer measurements between ipsilateral and
contralateral sides) and good muscular balance of the psoas, gluteus maximus,

comprised 19 women and 4 men, with a mean age of 50.5 &#177; 14.9 years (range, 15-82
years) at index THA, and 19 of 23 patients aged &#8804;60 years (<xref rid="table2-23259671231155143" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Their mean dance experience was
38.0 &#177; 14.4 years (range, 12-66 years), and they practiced dance for 29.5 &#177; 19.4
h/wk (range, 6-80 h/wk). Reasons for surgery were primary osteoarthritis (OA) in 8
hips, secondary OA due to dysplasia in 16 hips (all classified as Crowe grade 1),
secondary OA due to Perthes disease in 1 hip, and severe chondral lesion in 1 hip.
Overall, 23 hips received titanium-alloy hydroxyapatite-coated cementless stems,
while 3 hips received smooth stainless-steel cemented stems because of poor-quality
bone and/or osteoporosis. All stems had a fit-and-fill design, which was equal for
cementless and cemented stems, although cemented stems were slightly smaller to
leave space for a thin cement mantle. Only 1 of the ballet dancers reported
articular noise after index THA during extreme exercising (hyperextension in supine
position with hips in full external rotation and abduction) but not while
dancing.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="table2-23259671231155143" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demographics and Dance Characteristics of Initial Cohort (n = 23)<italic toggle="yes">

excluded from the final cohort (patient did not return to ballet after revision

CT, which revealed iliopsoas bursitis. The patient received corticosteroid

ballet dancers, THA performed by a muscle-sparing direct anterior approach using
custom femoral stems yielded excellent clinical outcomes at a minimum follow-up of 2
years. Notably, the highest satisfaction score of 10 points was reported for 88% of
the hips, while satisfaction scores between 8 and 9 points were reported for the
remaining 12%. Moreover, 72% of the operated hips were totally pain free, while the
remaining 28% had some residual pain with 1 to 4 points. Finally, 73% of patients
resumed ballet, and 86% resumed dance in general. It is important to note that for
27% of patients who did not return to ballet after surgery, none indicated the
reason to be pain or discomfort in the operated hip.</p><p>The present case series differs from the typical cohort scheduled for THA in terms of
patient age, hip morphology, ROM, and level of activity. Most patients (83%) were 60
years or less at index THA, and the majority (62%) had some degree of developmental
hip dysplasia, a common condition in the ballet population.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> All patients had at least 12 years of dance experience and practiced dance
for at least 6 h/wk before their hip injury or surgery. It is interesting to note
that some dancers in the present series sought medical consultation at the end stage
of OA with severely impaired ROM. In our experience, ballet dancers are reluctant to
undergo THA if they know of peers who had disappointing outcomes. Ballet dancers
might therefore wait a long time before deciding to undergo THA, sometimes deferring
surgery until their performing career is over. This could explain the wide age range
(15-82 years) of patients in the present study. Although univariable analysis
revealed age to be significantly associated with the postoperative OHS (&#946; = 0.1;
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .005), the postoperative FJS (&#946; = 0.4; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> =
.035), and time to return to ballet (&#946; = &#8211;0.2 per year; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .005),
multivariable analysis did not confirm these associations.</p><p>A previous case series on 9 active dancers and dance teachers after THA, for which
the surgical approach was not specified, reported frequent disappointment with the
speed of postoperative rehabilitation, even though it was objectively normal and
often faster compared to that in nondancers.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> The authors postulated that disappointment could be caused by dancers&#8217; high
demands and expectations, in view of the favorable results of THA in the general
population, which is considerably older and less active. The findings of the present
study are in contrast to this previous report, as all patients were satisfied or
very satisfied with their surgery, and only 14% did not return to dance but
specified that this was not because of pain or discomfort in the operated hip. For
those patients who returned to ballet, a statistically significant association was
found between age and time to return to dance, with older patients returning to
dance faster, possibly because their level and/or intensity was lower than that of
younger patients.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by Magan et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> investigated return to sports after THA. From 11 eligible studies on 2297
patients, the authors reported an overall adjusted return-to-sports rate of 84% (95%
CI, 71%-94%) at the end of the follow-up period, which ranged between 4 and 48
months. Interestingly, the authors found that postoperatively, there was a shift
away from high-impact sports, with more patients turning to lower impact sports
compared to their preinjury level of sporting function. Furthermore, a recent study
by Ukwuani et al<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> investigated return to dance after hip arthroscopic surgery for
femoroacetabular impingement in competitive, intermediate, and recreational dancers.
The authors reported that 62 of 64 patients (97%) returned to dance at an average of
7 &#177; 3 months; 40 dancers (63%) returned to a better level of participation, 20 (31%)
to the same level, and 2 (3%) to a lower level. Nonetheless, there was a decrease in
the number of hours of dance (from 11.5 &#177; 8.2 to 9.0 &#177; 7.3 h/wk; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>
= .041). In the present study, there was also a decrease in the number of hours of
dance practice (from 29.5 &#177; 19.4 to 20.0 &#177; 19.4 h/wk), but compared to Ukwuani et al,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> the rate of return to ballet was lower (73%), although the time to return was
shorter (5.1 &#177; 3.9 months). Furthermore, in the present study, 5 dancers (23%)
returned to a better level, 4 (18%) to the same level, and 7 (32%) to a lower level,
with patients who returned to ballet at the same or better level dancing for more
than double the number of hours compared to those who returned to ballet at a lower
level (26.4 &#177; 23.3 vs 11.9 &#177; 9.0 h/wk, respectively). It is important to note that
recovery after THA is harder than that after hip arthroscopic surgery.</p><p>The use of a muscle-sparing technique (without the release of any muscles or
ligaments) and/or the use of custom stems in the present case series could have
contributed to the favorable outcomes and satisfaction in a cohort of high-demand
patients. While one recent systematic review found no substantial differences in hip
morphology among dancers versus nondancers,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup> another recent systematic review found that ballet dancers more frequently
display pincer morphology rather than cam deformity.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> The present cohort of professional ballet dancers who underwent THA had a
high prevalence of developmental hip dysplasia. The use of custom stems likely
facilitated the accurate restoration of 3D extramedullary hip architecture and the
optimization of ROM, as suggested in a recent systematic review that showed that
custom stems provide good clinical outcomes, low complication rates, and excellent survival.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup> It is interesting to note that there were no significant differences in
clinical and functional outcomes between cementless and cemented stems, although
there was a considerable difference in subgroup sizes (23 vs 3 hips, respectively).
The role of bearing surfaces on long-term wear could not be investigated in the
present study, as results were only available at 2 years of follow-up. However, a
recent network meta-analysis investigated wear rates at 10 years after THA and
reported that ceramic or metal on conventional polyethylene had significantly higher
wear rates than ceramic on ceramic and ceramic on highly cross-linked polyethylene,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup> which may suggest that either of these 2 bearing surfaces could be

off-the-shelf stems, without accounting for the cost of preoperative CT.<sup>

</sup> The cost of custom stems is decreasing as production processes become more
efficient and manufacturers attain &#8220;economies of scale&#8221;; in fact, a study from 2020
reported that custom stems were only about 30% more expensive than off-the-shelf stems.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr10-23259671231155143" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, possible advantages of custom stems may be short-term savings in
hospital inventory, the logistics and sterilization of instruments, and the
potential to reduce long-term expenditure on reoperations and revisions, as the cost
of revision THA is significantly greater than that of primary THA.<sup>

</p><sec id="section13-23259671231155143"><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study has several limitations by virtue of its retrospective design.
First, the motivation to return to ballet after THA was not recorded; thus, it
remains unclear whether patients who did not return to dance were intending or
expecting to do so when they opted to undergo THA. Second, this study included
both current and former professional ballet dancers; thus, these findings cannot
be generalized or extrapolated to active professional ballet dancers. Third,
there was no comparative group of dancers who underwent surgery with
off-the-shelf stems or using another surgical approach. We believe that young
high-demand patients benefit from the combination of custom stems implanted by a
muscle-sparing direct anterior approach (without the release of any muscles or
ligaments), as this results in an accurate restoration of 3D hip anatomy (leg
length, femoral anteversion, femoral offset) as well as the least soft tissue
damage. Nonetheless, it is not possible to assess the relative contributions of
the anterior approach versus those of the custom stems in the results reported.
Fourth, the lack of preoperative clinical scores did not permit us to examine
net improvements. Fifth, clinical outcomes were only collected at one time point
postoperatively, which makes it difficult to assess changes in scores over time,
and radiographic outcomes were not collected. Finally, the study presents
satisfactory clinical scores at &#8805;2 years, suggesting good implant fixation;
however, no long-term survival data were available to assess potential long-term
wear in this young and active population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-23259671231155143"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In current or former professional ballet dancers, THA performed by a muscle-sparing
direct anterior approach using custom femoral stems yielded excellent clinical
outcomes at a minimum follow-up of 2 years, with the highest satisfaction score of
10 points reported for 88% of hips and 72% of hips being totally pain free.
Furthermore, 73% of patients resumed ballet, and 86% resumed dance in general. None
of the patients who did not resume ballet indicated pain or discomfort in the
operated hip to be the reason for stopping.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are grateful to Milagros Perez Rodriguez for her help with data
