The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to assess the diagnostic performance of three imaging modalities in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection: MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, and SPECT/CT with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients had to undergo at least 2 out of the 3 imaging modalities investigated. Sixty-three patients enrolled fulfilled such criteria and were included in the final analysis: 15 patients underwent all 3 imaging modalities, while 48 patients underwent at least 2 imaging modalities (MRI + PET/CT, MRI + SPECT/CT, or PET/CT + SPECT/CT). Final diagnosis of postoperative spinal infection was based either on biopsy or on follow-up for at least 6 months. The MRI, PET/CT, and SPECT/CT scans were read blindly by experts at designated core laboratories. Spine surgery included metallic implants in 46/63 patients (73%); postoperative spine infection was diagnosed in 30/63 patients (48%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Significant discriminants between infection and no infection included fever (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.041), discharge at the wound site (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and elevated CRP (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.042). There was no difference in the frequency of infection between patients who underwent surgery involving spinal implants versus those who did not. The diagnostic performances of MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT analyzed as independent groups were equivalent, with values of the area under the ROC curve equal to 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64&#8211;0.92) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64&#8211;0.98), respectively. SPECT/CT with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 yielded either unacceptably low sensitivity (44%) or unacceptably low specificity (41%) when adopting more or less stringent interpretation criteria. The best diagnostic performance was observed when combining the results of MRI with those of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, with an area under the ROC curve equal to 0.938 (95% CI: 0.80&#8211;1.00).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and MRI both possess equally satisfactory diagnostic performance in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection, the best diagnostic performance being obtained by combining MRI with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT.

Although lower rates (1&#8211;4%) have more recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], postoperative infection still constitutes an important complication of spine surgery that often requires hospitalization/reoperation, with increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Early clinical diagnosis of postoperative spinal infection remains challenging, since symptoms are often nonspecific and inflammatory markers remain abnormal early postsurgery. A combination of laboratory tests and imaging investigations follows clinical suspicion of postoperative spinal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Although planar X-ray imaging may reveal periimplant lysis, reduced disc space, and/or bone destruction, it often fails to diagnose spondylodiscitis until 2&#8211;8 weeks after onset of symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) is relatively insensitive to diagnose early postoperative spinal infections, and is predominantly used for guiding biopsy.</p><p id="Par8">Whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high diagnostic accuracy for infection in the nonoperated spine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is more challenging in the postoperative spine. The few MRI-based studies in postoperative spondylodiscitis are hampered by small sample sizes and are partially contradictory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thus leaving the role of MRI in the diagnosis of postoperative spondylodiscitis uncertain.</p><p id="Par9">PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG for assessing infection/inflammation is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], especially for spinal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] where the high interstitial pressure due to infection-related edema prevents efficient accumulation of radiolabeled cells at the infection site. Compared to CT and MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT imaging provides the advantages of whole-body coverage to detect also unsuspected distant foci of infection, and lesser artifacts due to metallic implants.</p><p id="Par10">In a recent multicenter retrospective study comparing the diagnostic accuracy of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and MRI in 44 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the diagnostic performance of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT was consistently greater than that of MRI, although not reaching statistical significance: 86.4% sensitivity versus 66.7%, 81.5% specificity versus 75.0%, 79.2% positive predictive value versus 66.0%, 88.0% negative predictive value versus 75.0%. The authors concluded that a prospective study is needed to validate their preliminary results.</p><p id="Par11">Regarding single-photon emitting agents to image infection independent from leukocyte binding, interest is rising on a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled fragment of the natural antimicrobial compound ubiquicidin, a 59-amino acid peptide part of innate immunity against infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; its cationic 29-41 fragment (UBI 29-41) binds preferentially to the anionic microbial cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The aim of this prospective study was to determine the diagnostic performance of MRI, scintigraphy with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41, and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p id="Par13">This prospective multicenter Coordinated Research Project (CRP <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="E13040">E13040</ext-link>), initiated by the Section of Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging, Division of Human Health of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA, Vienna, Austria), was conducted over a 4-year period from December 2013 to December 2017. Clinical follow-up continued for at least six additional months for those patients who did not undergo bacteriologic culture and/or diagnostic biopsy.</p><p id="Par14">The protocol adopted for the study includes three imaging modalities (MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, and SPECT/CT with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41). Patients had to undergo at least two of such imaging modalities within a predefined time window to be included in final data analysis; time window was 2 weeks between MRI and PET/CT or SPECT/CT, and 1 week between PET/CT and SPECT/CT. A total of 63 patients fulfilled these criteria, as well as all the inclusion criteria listed further below.</p><p id="Par15">In addition to the requirement of prior spinal surgery (with or without implantation of metallic spinal implants), the inclusion criteria were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par16">Age of at least 18 years at the time of evaluation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">Clinical suspicion of postoperative spinal infection after spinal surgery.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Willingness to undergo the MR, PET/CT, and/or SPECT/CT scans.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par19">To the purpose of the present study, the sole implantation of spinal devices, e.g., infusion pump for analgesic purposes, was not considered sufficient to classify patients as having undergone spinal surgery.</p><p id="Par20">Consensus was developed among participant regarding the criteria to be taken into account for supporting the clinical suspicion of postoperative spinal infection. Such criteria were (1) fever (persisting beyond the 2nd postoperative day in case of early postoperative infection), (2) pain at the surgical site (especially of the throbbing type), (3) an inflamed, erythematous suture line, (4) discharge at the surgical wound, (5) raised inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP, especially with a further rising trend), and (6) elevated total leukocyte count. The presence of at least 4 of such 6 criteria would indicate a high clinical suspicion of postoperative infection (rising to very high suspicion in case of a dirty/purulent discharge versus a clear, serous discharge). On the other hand, the presence of 3 or less of such indicators (in isolation or combination) would translate into a low/medium suspicion of postoperative spine infection.</p><p id="Par21">No time limitations were set regarding the period elapsed since spine surgery to onset of symptoms and diagnostic imaging, in order to include in the investigation both early and delayed postoperative infections.

Diagnostic tests enabling early diagnosis of postoperative spine infection promote timely initiation of appropriate treatment, therefore reducing such high treatment-related costs.</p><p id="Par63">The results obtained in this study provide ground for several considerations. In general, our data confirm that clinical judgement alone is not reliable enough to correctly identify postoperative spine infection, which was confirmed in only 30 out of the 63 patients in whom it had been suspected on clinical grounds (&lt; 50% of the cases). The only discriminant factors with statistical significance as to infection versus no infection were discharge at the wound site, fever, and elevated CRP.</p><p id="Par64">Concerning each imaging modality separately, in our patients&#8217; population the diagnostic performances of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and MRI were approximately equivalent, with only marginal differences in sensitivity, specificity, and the associated diagnostic parameters. The values given in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for the area under the ROC curve correspond to the best reasonable compromise between sensitivity and specificity. Depending on the clinical scenario where either [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and/or MRI is employed, one might want to maximize sensitivity (thus making the scan especially useful to rule out infection) or specificity (thus making the scan especially useful to ascertain with certainty the presence of infection&#8212;yet being aware that some cases with infection will be missed). Either of these two goals can reasonably be achieved by adopting less or more stringent criteria when interpreting the scan as positive for infection.</p><p id="Par65">The diagnostic performances of MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in suspected vertebral infection for patients not previously submitted to spinal surgery have been reported to be virtually equivalent in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The results obtained in the 48 patients of this study evaluated with MRI demonstrate that this imaging modality is a fairly good diagnostic test for spine infection also in the postoperative setting, provided that well-defined interpretation criteria are adopted.</p><p id="Par66">It is reasonable to assume that, in this scenario, radionuclide imaging based on functional/metabolic evaluation of the local changes induced by infection can provide useful diagnostic information to complement the morphologic and structural information provided by MRI. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT data from 315 intervertebral disc levels (based however on only 9 patients without prior spine surgery) showed the SUV<sub>max</sub> of infected disc levels to range between 3 and 12.7, with an optimal threshold of 4.2 for infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These results are hardly transferable directly to our study population of patients with suspected postoperative spine infection. Therefore, when interpreting the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT scans we did not rely on SUV, also because this parameter has not been proven to discriminate patients with from those without infection in general, including suspected spine infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Overall, the results obtained in our prospective study reach similar conclusions as in a recent retrospective study that compared the diagnostic performances of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and MRI in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection following surgery with hardware implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The parameters of diagnostic performance of the two imaging modalities are also very similar in the two studies, although slightly better in a consistent manner in our study than in the study by Follenfant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For easier comparison, Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> lists the main diagnostic parameters obtained in the two studies (sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values). Altogether, these two studies support the notion that imaging with either MRI and/or [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT provide crucial information to establish a correct diagnosis in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection, including patients either with or without implants. Moreover, another important conclusion reached in our prospective study, previously not identified, is that MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT provide somewhat complementary information, as demonstrated by the optimal diagnostic performance obtained when combining the two imaging modalities, with an AUC equal to 0.938 at ROC analysis (see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This results in excellent confidence for confirming or excluding postoperative spine infection. In this regard, the growing diffusion of PET/MR instrumentation raises interesting issues on the potential benefits of hybrid [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/MR imaging in patients with suspected infection as a novel &#8220;single-shop stop&#8221;. Although the benefits of this imaging approach have been explored in patients with as variety of benign musculoskeletal conditions including infection in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], no sufficient data are so far available regarding patients with suspected postoperative spine infection.<table-wrap id="Tab4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of the main diagnostic parameters obtained in the present study with those reported by Follenfant et al.

Adopting the threshold for positivity indicated by Akhtar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] yielded good specificity (83%), associated however with unacceptably low sensitivity (44%); this resulted in an overall AUC under the ROC curve equal to 0.663, which indicates a poor diagnostic test. On the other hand, lowering the threshold to score 1 (less stringent criteria for positivity) did improve sensitivity&#8212;but resulted in an unacceptably low specificity (41%). The suboptimal diagnostic performance of SPECT/CT with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 is carried along when this scan is combined with MRI (see above). A somewhat intermediate result is obtained by combining the two radionuclide-based imaging modalities, PET/CT and SPECT/CT. It is unlikely that such low sensitivity of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 for clear-cut positive scans (score 2) is due to the lower resolution properties of SPECT/CT imaging versus MRI or PET/CT imaging. The possibility must therefore be considered that the localization properties of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 per se are not always optimal. In this regard, quality control of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 after radiolabeling and before injection into patients relies solely on free <sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate&#8212;a quality control step favorably passed at all participating centers. Nonetheless, there might be other physicochemical factors altering the binding properties of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 in such a way that cannot be ascertained with the current quality control procedure.</p><p id="Par69">In conclusion, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT and MRI both possess equally satisfactory diagnostic performance in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection, the best diagnostic performance being obtained by combining MRI with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT. Instead, the diagnostic performance of SPECT/CT imaging with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 resulted to be suboptimal for diagnosing spine infection, at least in the postoperative clinical setting explored with the present study (see example of a false-negative <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 study in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When compared to other infection tracers such as radiolabeled antibiotics (no longer commercially available), <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 exhibits much lower target-to-background ratios in infected lesions. The question remains unanswered whether this is due to its lower binding specificity or to a lower number of molecules bound per bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, discrepant indications derive from published studies regarding the optimal time window for imaging infection with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41, whether at 30 min or 60 min postinjection. Although tracer accumulation at the infection site seems to peak around 30 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], interpretation of imaging at 60 min might be facilitated by the lower blood pool activity at this later time. There is an ongoing debate about the optimal imaging time for best target-to-background ratios, which should be settled on the basis of larger clinical experience in different centers.<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A 57-year-old man presented with back pain, fever, and raised CRP level (21.32 mg/L) about 12 months after being submitted to lumbar surgery L3-L5.

Although optimal diagnostic performance is achieved by combining these two imaging modalities, further investigations should aim at assessing the cost-effectiveness of performing separately both examinations systematically in any given patients with suspected postoperative infection of the spine. Although the results obtained in this study showed no statistically significant differences in the diagnostic performance parameters between MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, there are nevertheless slight differences that might in principle favor the use of one imaging modality over the other in particular clinical scenarios. Considering that a highly specific diagnostic test correctly identifies the nonaffected individuals (because of very low false-positive results) and considering the parameters of diagnostic performance reported in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, in case of high/very high clinical suspicion of infection [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT might be preferred as first-line imaging over MRI. On the other hand, a highly sensitive diagnostic test correctly identifies the affected individuals (because of very low false-negative results); therefore, MRI might be preferred as first-line imaging over [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT to exclude the presence of disease in case of low/medium clinical suspicion of infection. Based on these considerations, a tentative algorithm might be envisaged for the complementary use of MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. This algorithm is based on the assumptions that both MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT are readily available in an ideal hospital environment and that the trend for better sensitivity of MRI and better specificity of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT observed in this study is firmly established by additional controlled clinical trials. On the other hand, in case MRI is not readily accessible and no PET/CT equipment is available in the local Nuclear Medicine center, the relatively high specificity of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 SPECT/CT makes this imaging modality a valuable option to confirm infection in case of a positive scan.<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Proposed algorithm for diagnostic imaging in patients with suspected postoperative spine infection; other confirmatory tests (biopsy, microbiological culture of discharge at wound site) are not indicated in this flow diagram&#8212;which only concerns imaging. Because of suboptimal diagnostic performance and limited commercial availability, the use of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 SPECT/CT imaging is not included in this diagnostic algorithm, which is expected to have more general validity and applicability. Clinical suspicion prompts diagnostic imaging for confirmation and assessment of the extent/severity of infection. Although rather insensitive for infection (especially early post-surgery), plain X-ray (not indicated in the diagram) can occasionally be used to rule out gross skeletal changes such as displacement of bone segments and/or metallic implants. This diagram is based on 2 basic assumptions: 1) both MRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT are readily available in an ideal hospital environment; 2) the trend for better sensitivity of MRI and better specificity of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT observed in this study is firmly established by additional controlled clinical trials. In the left side of the diagram, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT is introduced after the diagnosis of postoperative spine infection has been established by MRI, as a possible option for a baseline scan before starting therapy, considering better suitability of functional metabolic imaging ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT) rather than MRI for assessing response to therapy [ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In case of positively established postoperative spine infection, treatment will depend on imaging findings and on clinical ground (e.g., presence of neurological signs/symptoms, sepsis, stability problems of the spine, etc.). In case of limited access to MRI and to PET/CT imaging, the relatively high specificity of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-UBI 29-41 SPECT/CT makes this imaging modality a valuable option to confirm infection in case of a positive scan</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO4" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="259_2020_5109_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec
