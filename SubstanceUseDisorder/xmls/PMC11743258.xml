Our analysis included Medicaid beneficiaries with geocoded addresses aged &#8805;18&#8239;years in Utah (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;157,739). We geocoded beneficiary addresses and assigned them to census block groups. We compared the socioeconomic status of block groups (Singh&#8217;s area deprivation index) with the proportion of complex needs, defined based on cluster analysis as 1 physical condition with depression or&#8239;&#8805;&#8239;2 physical with &#8805;1 mental health condition. Spatial mapping was performed of prevalence quantiles grouped by count overlaid with Medicaid-covered mental health facilities. Prevalence of complex needs was 18.9% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;29,742); beneficiaries with &gt;3 emergency department visits had 12.8 odds of having complex needs; 39.7% of beneficiaries with &gt;$5,000 in annual costs had complex needs. Common comorbid conditions among beneficiaries with complex needs were hypertension (56.0%), hyperlipidemia (35.5%), depression (68.8%), anxiety (56.2%), drug use (16.0%), and alcohol use disorders (15.2%). Census block groups with higher deprivation had a higher proportion of complex needs (<italic toggle="yes">&#961;</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.21, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;&lt;&#8239;0.001). There was a statistically significant spatial autocorrelation of the prevalence of complex needs (Moran&#8217;s I index: 0.65; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;&lt;&#8239;0.001). Six high-count census blocks had no mental health facilities. Areas with increased socioeconomic deprivation had a greater proportion of complex needs and fewer mental health facilities. Integrated programs addressing both physical and mental health conditions with a focus on socioeconomically deprived areas might benefit Medicaid recipients in populations such as those in Utah.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>physical health</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>Medicaid</kwd><kwd>GIS</kwd><kwd>social determinants</kwd><kwd>comorbidity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="25"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="4812"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Public Mental Health</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One in five Medicaid beneficiaries had mental and physical comorbidities (complex needs).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased socioeconomic deprivation score is associated with increased complex needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is spatial autocorrelation of the prevalence of complex needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Areas with greater deprivation need more integrated mental and physical health services.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beginning in late 2015, Utah Medicaid identified a limited proportion of substantial need and substantial healthcare use patients who accounted for a disproportionate expenditure of Medicaid costs. Some beneficiaries in the top percentile of healthcare costs have frequent contact with high-cost healthcare services that may not be fully addressing their complex needs, particularly those needs related to comorbid physical and mental health conditions (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Typically, persons with physical and mental health comorbidities have poorer health outcomes and higher healthcare costs (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Medicaid beneficiaries with physical and mental health comorbidities cost up to 75% more than those without mental health comorbidities (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The high proportion of mental health conditions among Medicaid beneficiaries with physical health conditions nationally has been documented (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite the presence of high levels of physical and mental health comorbidities among beneficiaries, Medicaid-covered mental health services have historically been segregated from physical health services (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This fragmentation of the healthcare system makes both mental health and physical health services more difficult to access, resulting in unmet patient needs and increased healthcare costs (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Physical and mental health comorbidities are exacerbated by socioeconomic deprivation (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A better understanding of the healthcare needs of these patients and the socioeconomic factors that affect healthcare use can help achieve healthcare cost containment and improve population health outcomes (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Limited information is available regarding the association between comorbid physical and mental health conditions and geographical socioeconomic disparities among Utah Medicaid beneficiaries. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to characterize the complex needs of Utah Medicaid beneficiaries and examine how complex needs are associated with socioeconomic deprivation as measured by the Singh area deprivation index (ADI) (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We hypothesized that socioeconomic deprivation was associated with an increased prevalence of comorbidities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4"><title>Study design and eligibility criteria</title><p>We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective cohort analysis of Utah Medicaid claims data from the Division of Medicaid and Health Financing at the Utah Department of Health (UDOH). Medicaid claims data are the medical bills submitted to Utah Medicaid for the services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries by care providers; each claim is associated with a date of service. To capture the entire population of Medicaid beneficiaries in a 12-month period, we reviewed claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries eligible for at least 1&#8239;month in Utah during Fiscal Year 2017 (from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017). We extracted Utah Medicaid claims costs using Structured Query Language from the Medicaid centralized data warehouse, which contains patient-managed care, fee for service, and pharmacy claims. Claims costs during the 12&#8239;months before a beneficiary&#8217;s most recent claim based on the date of service in the study period were used. This design was selected in order to simulate rolling patient identification, which is more representative of data that would be used operationally to identify high utilizers and less likely to be biased by an arbitrary time cut point that might not capture changes in care-seeking behavior (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Persons eligible for at least 1&#8239;month during the 12&#8239;months without any medical claims were assigned a cost of $0. Data were collected at the individual patient level and included the patient&#8217;s unique identifier, date of birth, number of months they were eligible for Medicaid, diagnosis codes, address, demographic information, and medical costs.</p><p>The sampling population included beneficiaries enrolled in managed care or fee-for-service. Refugees and custody medical patients were excluded. We limited the analysis to adults aged &#8805;18&#8239;years. The Institutional Review Boards at the Utah Department of Health (Approval #533) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (HSR #2018-00189) determined that this study did not constitute human subjects&#8217; research.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">International Classification of Diseases</italic>, Tenth Revision and the <italic toggle="yes">International Classification of Diseases</italic>, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM) codes from claims data were used to define the main outcome of interest: beneficiaries with chronic physical and mental health conditions (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Chronic disease algorithms from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) were used to classify chronic disease combinations (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Based on previous published analysis conducted on the data, which identified that those with complex physical and mental health conditions were clustered (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), we defined complex needs of Medicaid beneficiaries as a chronic physical condition plus a mental health condition from the CCW Chronic Conditions categories (CCW-CC), or at least two physical conditions and any mental health condition from the CCW Other Chronic, Mental Health, or Potentially Disabling Conditions categories (CCW-OC) (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Beneficiary addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS 10.5 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA). Software matching option parameters were set to 70% for spelling sensitivity, 70% minimum candidate score, and 70% minimum score match. A comparison of matched to unmatched addresses revealed that more addresses in urban areas vs. those in rural areas were geocoded. Because of this, we assigned a population-adjusted centroid value to any address having a zip code comprising a single census block group (all rural areas in Utah) with &gt;50% unmatched addresses. Persons with missing addresses and those whose address was listed as homeless were excluded from the geocoding process. All geocoded addresses were assigned to their census block groups.</p><p>Because Utah&#8217;s Medicaid data lack information on key socioeconomic characteristics of beneficiaries, we used the 2015 Singh area deprivation index (ADI) to look for area-level effects of socioeconomic position. The ADI calculates a score by census block group using 17 U.S Census Bureau measures that characterize the level of socioeconomic need in a neighborhood (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Higher index values represent higher levels of deprivation. We applied Utah-specific ADI quintiles adapted from Knighton et al. (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) from the original Singh method. Knighton et al. quintiles are the rounded census block group area deprivation scores binned into five approximately equal size groups, from lowest score (least deprivation) to highest score (highest deprivation). We calculated the proportion of beneficiaries with complex needs and ADI quintiles at the census block group level. We calculated Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation to measure the association between these two variables.</p><p>We measured healthcare utilization by the number of emergency department visits, number of hospital inpatient visits, and dollar amount in claims, including for managed care patients, during the study period. We used the X<sup>2</sup> test to assess trends in the proportion of beneficiaries with complex needs by utilization. We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression (<italic toggle="yes">glmr</italic> in the <italic toggle="yes">lme4</italic> package in R v3.5.3 [R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria]) including census block group as a random effect to measure the association of complex needs with area deprivation index quintile and healthcare utilization while adjusting for sex, age groups (categorized as 18&#8211;40, 41&#8211;65, and&#8239;&gt;&#8239;65), ethnicity, and number of months (categorized as 1&#8211;3, 4&#8211;6, 7&#8211;9, and&#8239;&gt;&#8239;9) on Medicaid. We tested for multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor. We conducted an analysis of variance to compare full and reduced models. We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding beneficiaries with no claims and those with &lt;12&#8239;months of continued eligibility for Medicaid. We present odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the full model, which demonstrated the best fit.</p><p>We used GeoDa (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and QGIS (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) software for spatial mapping of counts and proportions of complex needs. The census block group-level map was overlaid with Medicaid-covered mental health facility locations to find the census blocks with the highest counts and proportions of beneficiaries with complex needs. We also identified the census block groups with the highest counts and limited or no access to mental health facilities. Local Empirical Bayesian Moran&#8217;s I statistic (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) measured the presence of spatial dependence of the proportions of complex needs at the census block level in Utah.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec7"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>Among adult beneficiaries, 157,739 (93.9%) beneficiary addresses were geocoded.

This group of beneficiaries contributed disproportionately to the expenditure of resources as measured by the number of emergency department visits, the number of inpatient hospitalizations, and claims costs over the study period. Persons with &gt;3 emergency department visits had approximately 13 times the odds of having complex needs than those with no visits, and persons with &gt;$5,000 paid claims during this 12-month period had six times the odds of having complex needs than those with $1&#8211;$500 in paid claims.</p><p>Our analysis also demonstrated that at an ecological level, socioeconomic disparities were related to the prevalence of complex needs, with the proportion of beneficiaries with complex needs increasing with increasing socioeconomic deprivation at the census block group level. Our findings are consistent with the literature, which reports that people of low socioeconomic positions and communities with higher deprivation are more likely to be depressed and are more likely to have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and chronic medical conditions (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This is likely because beneficiaries living in higher deprivation communities often have greater exposure to stressors that negatively impact health, such as higher rates of pollution, crime, and unemployment, and lower access to services that can improve quality of life, such as safe housing, green spaces, and healthy food options. A United States-wide study of geospatial hotspots found that the highest-ranking census tracts in the nation exhibited poorer mental and physical health. Utah performed better than many other states, with fewer hotspots than neighboring states such as Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Geographic conditions associated with disparity have a profound impact on psychological and behavioral factors that influence both physical and mental health (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The findings concerning the lack of mental health facilities in locations with high ADI were surprising. Other national-level studies have reported conversely that low-income areas have a higher proportion of outpatient mental health facilities (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Nevertheless, studies that have reported on mental health providers (instead of facilities) have concluded that similar to our study, communities with higher deprivation have a shortage of mental health providers (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Expansion of preventive and routine mental health services in underserved areas can result in substantial improvements to mental health and reductions in the use of emergency services and hospitalizations. Additional studies might contribute to an improved understanding of how the availability of mental health facilities in socially deprived regions influences mental and physical health outcomes in Utah.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our results cannot be generalized beyond the Utah Medicaid population; however, they do provide insight into the association between patients with complex medical needs and the ADI. Inherent bias exists in the use of aggregate characteristics as a proxy for individual deprivation (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, bias is introduced by reliance on healthcare services claims data. Beneficiaries with complex needs who did not have any medical claims in the defined period would have been undercounted, and it is not possible from the data to estimate the extent of this bias. A separate sensitivity analysis was conducted to exclude beneficiaries with no claims or those with &lt;12&#8239;months of Medicaid eligibility, revealing no difference in conclusions. We identify the standard limitations of the modifiable area unit problem and the ecological fallacy of the spatial autocorrelation analysis. We also recognize that our analysis was limited to conditions listed in the Medicaid CCW, which is not an exhaustive list of possible chronic physical and mental health conditions. Because address geocoding was not possible for approximately 6.1% of beneficiaries, there might be an underrepresentation of high-deprivation socioeconomic groups that lack a permanent address. However, the prevalence of complex medical needs patients did not differ between beneficiaries with geocoded addresses and those without.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports on 8% of adults residing in Utah (Utah adult population estimated to be 2,176,739 in 2017) (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It describes a population that relies on state resources for healthcare needs. Our analysis reveals that areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation have greater comorbid physical and mental health needs and lower access to mental health facilities. In Utah, funding for public mental health services is decentralized, with regions or counties having autonomous local mental health authorities. Literature reveals that decentralization contributes to a lack of integration of physical and mental health services (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For complex needs patients with mental and chronic physical health comorbidities, integrated healthcare systems might improve health outcomes and reduce use and costs (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The development of integrated programs addressing both physical and mental health with a focus on socioeconomically deprived areas might benefit Medicaid recipients in populations such as those in Utah. The provision of integrated preventive and clinical care for beneficiaries with physical and mental health conditions might result in reduced high-cost services, such as unnecessary emergent care and inpatient hospitalizations.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec13"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licenses/restrictions: our study used restricted data from Medicaid Utah.
