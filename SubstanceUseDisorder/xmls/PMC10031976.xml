Few published studies investigate experiences in the immediate period (i.e., first 24&#160;h) of re-entry among people with OUD.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p id="Par2">To understand the barriers and facilitators to treatment and reintegration of people with OUD during the initial transition from carceral settings back into the community.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">From January&#8211;December 2017, we conducted 42 semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients with a history of incarceration who were receiving methadone at a not-for-profit, low-barrier opioid treatment program. Interviews probed participants&#8217; community re-entry experiences immediately following incarceration. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a Thematic Analysis approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The main themes described the experiences during the 24&#160;h following release, reacclimating and navigating re-entry barriers, and re-entry preparedness and planning. Participants noted the initial 24&#160;h to be a period of risk for returning to substance use or an opportunity to engage with OUD treatment as well as a tenuous period where many lacked basic resources such as shelter or money. When discussing the subsequent re-entry period, participants noted social challenges and persistent barriers to stable housing and employment. Participants overall described feeling unprepared for release and suggested improvements including formal transition programs, improved education, and support to combat the risk of overdose and return to substance use after incarceration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">In this study that qualitatively examines the experiences of people with incarceration histories and OUD enrolled in methadone treatment, we found that participants faced many barriers to community re-entry, particularly surrounding basic resources and treatment engagement. Participants reported feeling unprepared for release but made concrete suggestions for interventions that might improve the barriers they encountered. Future work should examine the incorporation of these perspectives of people with lived experience into the development of transition programs or re-entry classes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Methadone</kwd><kwd>Opioid use disorder</kwd><kwd>Incarceration</kwd><kwd>Re-entry</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>APT Foundation </institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Upon release from a carceral setting, there is a substantial elevation in risk of return to use and overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Risk for substance-related death is high in the initial weeks following release from incarceration and substance overdose is the leading cause of death after release, making the first 24&#160;h post release critical for vulnerable individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The initial weeks after release from jail or prison, termed &#8220;re-entry,&#8221; are associated with economic uncertainty, fractured social and family relationships, and housing instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous qualitative research documents the challenges formerly incarcerated individuals experience post-release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, O&#8217;Brien et al., describes post-release challenges related to meeting basic survival needs such as housing and employment, as well as reconnecting to children and other family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For people with OUD who are incarcerated, there is added complexity related to need for treatment and recovery; re-entry provides an important window to connect to evidence-based treatment.</p><p id="Par7">Rigorous research demonstrates that medications for opioid use disorder [MOUD] with an opioid receptor agonist (methadone), partial agonist (buprenorphine), or opioid antagonist (naltrexone) can facilitate recovery from OUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These life-saving pharmacotherapies, often delivered at opioid treatment programs (OTPs) along with other treatment and recovery services, can facilitate reintegration and reduce risk of return to substance use and overdose. However, there is limited research on barriers and facilitators that individuals with OUD experience immediately following release from incarceration and how these experiences directly or indirectly affect access to OTPs.</p><p id="Par8">Return to substance use during the re-entry period is influenced by social environment, financial situation, housing setting, emotional support, and comorbid medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition to lack of support and limited resources immediately post-incarceration, individual attitudes towards MOUD can reduce the likelihood of evidence-based treatment engagement and increase risk of nonmedical opioid use and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, existing structural support for pre-release planning is limited and rarely accounts for barriers or personal priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of transitioning into society after incarceration for people with OUD may assist in improving the existing resources and infrastructure for this population. Given the nascent state of the research regarding experiences of re-entry among persons with OUD, a qualitative approach that solicits first-hand accounts of personal experiences may be particularly beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The aims of this study were to investigate the re-entry planning experience, perceived levels of preparation to return to life after incarceration, and the challenges faced during the re-entry period among people in an OTP with a history of incarceration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Context</title><p id="Par9">The study was conducted at the APT Foundation, Inc. (APT), a not-for-profit community-based organization affiliated with Yale School of Medicine. APT offers primary and psychiatric care along with substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, including four licensed OTPs. APT utilizes the &#8220;open access model,&#8221; a low-barrier treatment approach which aims to eliminate common OUD treatment barriers, such as long wait times, requiring abstinence from other substances, or being able to pay for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sampling strategy</title><p id="Par10">Participants were recruited voluntarily using flyers posted at all APT clinic sites, as well as clinician referral. Inclusion criteria were: (1) English fluency; (2) current OTP enrollment; (3) incarceration history defined as spending one day minimum in jail or prison in one&#8217;s life. One hundred individuals contacted the team for screening. Prospective participants were placed on a contact waitlist in the order in which they contacted the study in response to flyers. A research assistant sequentially contacted people on the waitlist to schedule an interview until the interviewers determined that data saturation had been met; fifty-one were contacted for interview scheduling; forty-five participated in interviews, which were concluded due to thematic saturation. Three interviews were excluded from the final sample due to technical difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical issues pertaining to human subjects</title><p id="Par11">The study was reviewed and exempted by the Yale University IRB and was approved by the APT Foundation Board of Directors. Participants provided informed consent and were compensated with a $25 gift card. Data and interviews were deidentified by trained research assistants not involved with data analysis. Demographic survey data was not connected to participant interviews or medical records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection and processing</title><p id="Par12">Interviews were conducted privately as a single appointment at the participant&#8217;s treatment site by experienced qualitative interviewers: a licensed clinical psychologist (DTB) and a graduate student in public health (AE). The semi-structured interview guide included the following domains: (1) key problems faced after release; (2) description of the first 24&#160;h post- release; and (3) experiences with housing and employment post release. The interviews ranged from 25 to 55&#160;min (mean 38&#160;min). Interviews were audiotaped, and research assistants transcribed the transcripts verbatim, removing identifying information. Participants completed anonymous demographics surveys.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par13">Qualitative analyses focused on interview questions about participants&#8217; experiences during community re-entry (Appendix 1). Data were analyzed using Thematic Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] with a mixed deductive and inductive approach.&#160;The study team developed a list of deductive top-level codes after reading transcripts, with codes grouped into the following overarching themes: (1) experiences during the initial 24&#160;h after release from carceral settings; (2) reacclimating into society: housing, employment, and relationships; and (3) re-entry challenges. Contents of each coding category were reviewed to ensure agreement on the nature of respondents&#8217; responses to the interview. The first author (KH) led the qualitative analysis; she has extensive experience implementing qualitative investigations. Study team members KH, MG, and ET further refined the coding framework to include inductive secondary themes within each overarching theme. Using ATLAS.ti Mac (Version 22.1.0) and ATLAS.ti Web (Version 3.19.1.-2022-06-20), two coders (KH and ET) coded the data with this framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An inter-coder agreement process was conducted in which 20% of the data were double-coded and agreement was 88%.&#160;Results are reported following Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demographics</title><p id="Par14">Participants were 42 (19 female, 23 male) patients enrolled in OTPs who ranged in age from 26 to 70&#160;years, with a mean (SD) age of 42.9 (10) years.

Without such supports, MOUD treatment-seeking was not a priority; rather, survival needs were utmost in their minds. Participants who were not released to a structured environment overwhelmingly reported worry about a lack of support and were unable to focus on treatment-seeking. They had few or no resources, while simultaneously were burdened with many immediate concerns.<disp-quote><p id="Par31">My first day when I got released, they dropped me off in front of the courthouse at 5:30 in the morning and handed me my stuff and said there ya go&#8230; You don&#8217;t get money to get released.

So, I think that&#8217;s something they should do in jail so when you come home, you&#8217;re insured, you&#8217;re capable of going out and getting all the things you need. Going to the doctor, going to the clinic, whatever you need instead of having to go home, and then wait however long it takes to do it in the real world you know. I don&#8217;t think it could hurt to start the process sooner.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par120">-Participant 14</p><p id="Par121">Another related sentiment was feeling abandonment due to the manner of release, which resembled <italic toggle="yes">&#8220;moving cattle&#8221;</italic> [Participant 16].

There were several important findings. First, we found that people with OUD viewed the re-entry period as a time of possibility and risk regarding substance use and treatment, during which many struggled to meet basic needs. Second, both in the initial post-release period and overall re-entry episode, respondents reported challenges surrounding housing, employment, and social relationships. Third, participants reported feeling unprepared for release and suggested changes to improve the re-entry process for people with OUD, including improved treatment facilitation. Our findings build on the few prior studies examining the incarceration experience among people with OUD by evaluating the first 24-h post-release and re-entry preparation and focusing on individuals who are no longer incarcerated and engaged in methadone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par131">We found that the initial 24&#160;h after release were crucial to participants&#8217; decision to use substances or seek treatment. Our participants suggest that people enrolled in methadone treatment facing incarceration may be amenable to more structured linkage to treatment during this period. This finding is supported by other qualitative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For example, in a qualitative investigation of the Fresh Start Re-entry Program in Connecticut, formerly incarcerated individuals described how their case managers prepared them for release through services designed to facilitate their return to the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Qualitative research with carceral staff support these findings. For example, in interviews with jail staff, one study&#8217;s respondents stressed the importance of facilitating MOUD post release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Likewise, in interviews with medical and administrative staff at MOUD programs serving jail-referred individuals, respondents noted the need for more structured care coordination for jail-to-community-based MOUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par132">Though we are unaware of other studies which emphasize the first 24&#160;h after release, it is generally known that re-entry is a vulnerable period for return to substance use and overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Respondents reinforced this finding and noted that in addition to struggling with decisions about resuming substance use, they also encountered numerous logistic challenges including navigating transportation and shelter, consistent with other studies about re-entry for people with SUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These barriers provide an opportunity for actionable policy and practice. For example, Kaplowitz et al. found that participants suggested transportation options such as subsidized bus passes could facilitate treatment in the community post-release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par133">Other studies demonstrate a range of material barriers after release for individuals with and without OUD, including a lack of both personal resources and information on how to access resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is notable that many participants felt that the lack of resources ultimately set them up to return to prison or jail, emphasizing how social and structural factors influence criminal legal system involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. An element of Welsh and Rajah&#8217;s (2014) qualitative framework &#8220;re-entry work&#8221; is echoed in respondents&#8217; stories&#8212;the difficulty of caring for oneself, establishing housing, and renewing family relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In another qualitative study, people experiencing homelessness were afraid they would return to substance use after release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, Hyde et al., found that veterans recently released from prison expressed &#8220;transitional anxiety&#8221; which accompanied seeking housing and employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Participants noted that background checks for employment and educational programs that exclude persons with felony convictions limit options for people with a criminal record. Loosening these restrictions would offer more opportunities for employment and education for these individuals.</p><p id="Par134">Respondents also reported behavioral, emotional, and relationship-related difficulties reacclimating after release. They reported experiencing fear of returning to past social and behavioral patterns and of being released into settings that make substance use impossible to avoid. In a similar study, Kaplowitz et al. noted that such variables can impact engagement and retention in MOUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, participants perceived inadequate notice of their release, an absence of transitional programs to prepare them for re-entry, and inadequate education about how to avoid return to substance use post-incarceration. Engagement with discharge planners prior to release could provide information about services available upon re-entry into the community and information on the risk of overdose if substance use is reinitiated. Availability to meet upon release with peer navigators or people with prior incarceration experience to guide them through the process of re-entry and to assist with OTPs may alleviate some of these difficulties with reacclimating. Future research should examine how implementing such interventions prior to or upon release might impact re-entry outcomes. While prior research demonstrates that re-entry can be an emotionally tumultuous and high-risk time for individuals with OUD, more work is needed to identify the best program structures to implement to improve re-entry outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par135">Our findings extend and support the existing literature on the lack of transitional support and the paucity of referrals to MOUD or mental health counseling during the release period. They also bolster documentation of a need for both services, by highlighting suggestions made by people with lived experience of incarceration and OUD who were able to engage in MOUD treatment despite facing multiple barriers to obtain MOUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Consistent with prior study findings, participants noted that transition programs helped individuals with OUD to re-enter society by providing material support, a network of relationships, and continuity of MOUD care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The re-entry period is a time with high risk of overdose death, and better access to MOUD during this time is critical in reducing mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Lack of treatment due to breaks in MOUD continuity may lead to substance use and in turn an increase in mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Salem et al. advocate for the development of multi-level interventions at the individual, program, and societal level help bridge the gap during re-entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Transition programs, linkage to MOUD, and re-entry interventions such as case management services are associated with decreased recidivism and retention in treatment within this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In their systematic review of findings from qualitative evaluations of community re-entry programs, Kendall et al. found case workers were key to program success; suggesting that policy and practice to strengthen their role could lead to improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par136">Access to MOUD by incarcerated persons varies widely by location and carceral setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. On April 5, 2022, the US Department of Justice issued new guidance clarifying that across-the-board policies banning MOUD violate the Americans with Disabilities Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The release of this guidance accelerated an ongoing shift at the state level towards providing incarcerated individuals access to MOUD. For example, the US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts announced on April 1, 2022 that it had coordinated with state and local officials to ensure that all available types of MOUD would be provided in all state and county correctional facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, not all states have acted in response to this guidance, and many incarcerated persons still face difficulty obtaining MOUD; some facilities only provide access to Naltrexone or utilize MOUD solely to manage withdrawal, while others restrict MOUD access to only certain populations of prisoners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Nonetheless, policymakers can utilize existing resources to comply with this guidance, such as adoption of model laws, and thereby quickly and meaningfully expand MOUD access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Access can also be improved through updating federal methadone regulations, elimination of the Medicaid payment exclusion for incarcerated individuals, and through creating alliances with community-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Improving MOUD access while incarcerated remains critical, with preliminary analysis of Connecticut's pilot program indicating that participation statistically reduced post-release non-fatal overdose and increased individual's likelihood of continuing methadone treatment after release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par137">Carceral settings are an often overlooked component of the opioid epidemic and present policy and practice opportunities for assessing individual risk for return to use, overdose education, and MOUD enrollment. Increasingly, research shows that inclusion of carceral settings in the continuum of care, such as pre-release initiation of buprenorphine, can overcome logistical barriers such as those described by study respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Transitional initiatives such as those examined in the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) can facilitate discharge planning, connect individuals to vital services post-release, and promote recovery from SUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Other helpful policy changes can be found in the Post-Release Opioid-Related Overdose Risk Model which include providing naloxone training and take-home kits to those leaving a criminal justice setting with a risk of return to opioid use; coordination between criminal justice settings, healthcare, and community-based treatment; and community partnerships to assist with housing and job placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Other possibly helpful initiatives include Transitions Clinic Network (TCN) that is designed to meet needs through a national network of medical homes for those recently released from incarceration with chronic health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par138">This study has limitations. Participants were treatment-engaged individuals so generalizability to other formerly incarcerated populations with OUD may be limited. While the coded responses from the interviews yielded potentially important themes related to participants&#8217; experiences, we did not collect data from others to corroborate these themes. Participants&#8217; experiences were not bifurcated on whether they had received their sentence or were unsentenced during their incarceration; there are differences in experiences with SUDs and re-entry concerns between these populations that this study did not address. Additionally, we did not systematically collect quantitative data on the duration, dates, and setting (e.g., prison versus jail) of each individual&#8217;s incarceration. If experiences between the two settings differ, this study did not capture them. It is possible that individual&#8217;s recall of their experiences could be affected by different time lengths, and this is a limitation of our work. To protect anonymity, participants&#8217; answers were not linked to demographic or clinical characteristics; these sources of information may have provided an enriched context for interpreting the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par139">In the first hours after release from incarceration, people with OUD faced many barriers to community re-entry, including problems accessing methadone treatment engagement, shelter and employment, and difficulty managing social relationships. Future investigations should consider examining the feasibility of widespread transitional program implementation with a focus on education about the overdose crisis within carceral settings, supporting and maintaining relationships during and post-incarceration as well as linkage to outpatient MOUD programs as interventions to reduce mortality during re-entry and enable people with OUD to return safely to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Appendix 1</title></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Qualitative interview questions</title><p id="Par143">
