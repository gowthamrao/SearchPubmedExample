Recognizing that police are frequently called to assist people experiencing a mental health crisis, it is of critical importance to public safety to understand the role of stress on officers&#8217; cognition when navigating such encounters. Despite this, how the timing of experiencing stress impacts officer cognition is understudied in applied police contexts and therefore remains unclear. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed data from a study of 57 police officers who wore heart rate monitors to record physiological arousal before, during, and after two reality-based scenarios (i.e., simulated calls for service) with individuals experiencing mental distress. Scenarios were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded to measure officers&#8217; perceptual memory of important elements in each scene, procedural memory to enact best practices, post-incident memory of their own actions, and higher-level situational understanding. We found a nuanced relationship between the timing of stress and cognitive performance, such that higher heart rate before and during scenarios improved understanding, decision making, and the appropriate choice of use of force option, but at the expense of officers&#8217; spatial processing. Increased heart rate during the post-incident debrief was associated with the following: making a lethal force error during the scenario, decreased memory for perceptual aspects of the scenario, and impaired recall of one&#8217;s own actions. Older and more experienced officers exhibited overall lower physiological arousal, and female officers demonstrated better cognitive performance compared to male officers. These results have practical implications in operational, training, evaluation, and testimonial police contexts and can inform future interventions aimed to improve outcomes when navigating stressful encounters, including crisis intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>perception</kwd><kwd>situational awareness</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>police</kwd><kwd>stress physiology</kwd><kwd>crisis intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The potentially severe personal, societal, legal, and public safety consequences of officers&#8217; decision-making may further exacerbate the impact of stress on performance. Furthermore, officers&#8217; memory of the complex context and rationale underlying their decisions needs to be preserved for investigative or testimonial purposes for years to come. Accordingly, police are expected to show a high caliber of cognitive performance, including accurate perception, understanding, and recall of work-related encounters, as well as enhanced procedural memory for complex motor skills acquired through training and experience (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). This may be especially relevant when navigating situations with individuals in mental health crisis, which may be less predictable. Despite the importance of understanding how the timing of stress responses may impact cognitive performance in applied police contexts, little research has examined the nuanced interplay between these factors (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota and Huhta, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2020</xref>). To address this gap in the literature, the present study aims to assess how physiological arousal before, during, and after simulated critical incident scenarios involving individuals in a mental health crisis impacts cognitive performance in occupationally relevant police settings.</p><p>Police are often the first to respond to persons in mental health crisis. They are therefore expected to frequently navigate situations involving individuals presenting either suicidal and/or violent behaviors that could be dangerous to themselves or others (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Huey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Livingston, 2016</xref>). These calls can be especially challenging for officers, given the greater amount of complexity and resources they require (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Godfredson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Charette et al., 2014</xref>). Further, the limited amount of training provided to officers is unlikely to cover the variety of situations that can transpire (<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Pelfrey and Young, 2020</xref>). There are additional factors that may exacerbate stress for both the individual and the officer, including the increased likelihood of UOF in such calls and the perceptions of police held by individuals experiencing mental illness (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Huey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Fyfe, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2008a</xref>). The fact that upwards of 10% of police calls for service involve interacting with persons in crisis only underscores the need for research on police cognition during such encounters (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Fry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Godfredson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A substantial amount of applied research has examined perceptual, motor, and cognitive processing in stressful police contexts more broadly. The literature highlights deficits associated with stress, such as: fine, gross (i.e., arrest, self-defence skills), and visuo-motor behaviors (i.e., gaze, fixation, blinking); perception of time, distance, and positioning, and; critical decision-making related to UOF (for reviews, see <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota and Huhta, 2019</xref>). Increased physiological arousal and accompanying performance decrements are observed during high-threat reality-based scenarios commonly used in operational field settings, as well as law enforcement training, assessment, and research (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Nieuwenhuys and Oudejans, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Nieuwenhuys et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>). Reality-based scenarios serve an important function by affording officers an opportunity to safely practice relevant skills in dynamic and representative environments (e.g., utilizing actors, simulated injuries and weapons, or varying levels of threat or complexity) including rare occurrences like mass casualty events or lethal force encounters (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">K&#246;rner and Staller, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Deliberate skill practice through reality-based training develops expertise, characterized by increased accuracy, speed and flexibility of performance (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Ericsson, 2008</xref>). By detecting patterns of information acquired through training and experience, expert decision-making strategies are increasingly intuitive, automatic, and elicit habitual responses that are less susceptible to interference from stress (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Kahneman, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Vickers and Lewinski, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Arble et al., 2019</xref>). Effective decision-making is fundamentally dependent on situational awareness (SA), another essential cognitive skill among police. SA can be defined as three components: (1) perception to the surrounding environment, (2) understanding or &#8216;sensemaking&#8217; based on current and prior knowledge, and (3) prediction of what may happen next (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Endsley, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota and Huhta, 2019</xref>). Recent reconceptualizations of SA in police contexts have also included awareness of oneself and how they impact the unfolding situation as an additional component of SA (&#8220;self-awareness&#8221;; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Huhta et al., 2022</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Despite these advances, it remains unclear how stress physiology impacts SA and subsequent memory of situational information during encounters with persons in crisis.</p><p>Basic science research conceptualizes that our episodic memory of a situation depends on multiple cognitive processes, including perception, attention, spatial processing, and higher-level cognitive control and inference. It is often considered a constructive process that shapes both present perception and later recall (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, 2012b</xref>). Our experience of an event is first filtered through one&#8217;s existing knowledge, relevant experiences, and current goals, which influence what is perceived, attended to, and later used for memory recollection (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Xue, 2018</xref>). Our recollection of the event is influenced by how the memory is probed, including any new incoming information, as well as our current attitudes, beliefs, and motivations (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Ozubko, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Loftus, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Naveh-Benjamin and Kilb, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Schacter, 2012a</xref>). Our memory for events is therefore not limited to the original experience, but rather a dynamic process that can be influenced by a variety of factors. This constructive nature is adaptive as it increases the efficient functioning of perception, understanding, and knowledge organization, however, can also lead to cognitive errors such as false memories (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Schacter et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Stress can also profoundly impact episodic memory formation and recall. However, the impact of stress depends on what stage of memory processing the stressor occurs in (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2017</xref>): experiencing stress during retrieval broadly impairs memory, whereas experiencing stress before encoding may impair memory unless the encoding period was short, or the learned materials were relevant to the stressor. Although there is limited research on the effect the timing of stress has on aspects of memory within police contexts, stress-induced perceptual distortions are commonly reported (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Klinger and Brunson, 2009</xref>). Such distortions include experiencing tunnel vision, behaving on &#8216;autopilot&#8217;, and distorted time and sound perception, which can impact what officers encode and in turn lead to false memories (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Hope et al., 2016</xref>). Prior studies mainly investigate the final recall stage of police memory, whereas systematic investigation of how stress influences encoding remains underexplored (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The present study examines how the timing of stress influences police officers&#8217; cognitive performance during simulated encounters involving individuals in mental health crises. By using coded and transcribed audio recordings of verifiable events, we can examine the impact of stress on both in-the-moment performance and subsequent recall controlling for idiosyncratic differences in memory construction. Stress is quantified through physiological arousal (i.e., maximum heart rate, HRMax) relative to the individual&#8217;s resting heart rate. HRMax was measured during (1) pre-scenario briefing, (2) the scenario itself, and (3) post-scenario debriefing. Cognitive performance is defined as perception, understanding, decision-making, and memory of the simulated encounters. We hypothesize that pre-scenario HRMax and HRMax during the scenarios will be related to aspects of cognitive performance, but with no clear direction of effect given the lack of existing literature in this applied setting. Measures of cognitive performance may be differentially impacted by physiological arousal if a lethal decision-making error is made. Finally, we expect increased HRMax during debriefing to be associated with overall reduced cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-seven active-duty frontline police officers (7 female, 1 sex not reported, mean age: 32.8&#8239;&#177;&#8239;6.3; mean years of service: 7.2&#8239;&#177;&#8239;5.6) participated in a previously reported intervention study (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>). The original study conducted an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> power analysis to determine a sufficient sample size for the original research goal, a within-subjects repeated-measure design, which indicated needing a total sample size of 24 participants and was exceeded at each time point of the intervention. The current observational study only assess data collected during the pre-intervention baseline evaluation session conducted in 2016. Participants were from a pool of approximately 750 frontline officers employed by a large urban police agency in Canada. Informed consent was provided by each participant before volunteering for the study. Participants were informed that they could withdraw at any point without penalty.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>At the start of the session, officers were fitted with training versions of their usual police equipment including a baton, conducted electrical weapon (CEW), firearm, pepper spray, and full uniform. They were also fitted with a portable heart rate (HR) monitor that adhered to their skin via electrodes under their clothing (Bodyguard 2; FirstBeat Technologies LTD, Jyv&#228;skyl&#228;, FI). Officers completed four live-action reality-based scenarios that were designed and executed in a manner similar to police training and evaluation procedures. However, scenarios were delivered solely for research purposes to determine baseline rates of performance and physiological arousal. Scenarios were counterbalanced for each officer, with breaks in between scenarios.</p><sec id="sec5"><title>Reality-based scenarios</title><p>The standard procedure of reality-based scenarios follows as such: the officer receives a briefing that mimics a call for service, during which they are given a radio dispatch containing limited information about the call. This can include suspect descriptions or details of the scene they will be attending (e.g., location, persons present). Officers then complete the scenario, during which they are required to: (1) form an understanding of the situation based on their perceptions, SA, and dispatch information, and (2) take action and make appropriate decisions, which can include physical tactics and positioning such as taking time and distance, giving verbal commands, and possibly employing a UOF option including lethal force if deemed necessary. After the scenario is complete, instructors typically conduct a post-incident debriefing where the officer can articulate their thought processes and provide rationale for their actions. In this way, the accuracy or &#8220;correctness&#8221; of decision-making can be judged based on the officers&#8217; in-the-moment perceptions and SA, but which must nonetheless adhere to legal and organizational best practices (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>The scenarios used in this study were reflective of what officers at this particular agency are often exposed to during field duties. Scenario 1 involved helping a suicidal individual in crisis and Scenario 2 involved de-escalating a violent encounter during a reported break-and-enter (see Scenario Descriptions for more detail). For the current study, qualified police instructors provided participants with very brief description of the situation before each scenario began. Instructors blew a whistle to mark start and stop times of the scenario. Each scenario was followed by an instructor-led debriefing period that probed the officers&#8217; SA and decision-making. However, for the purpose of the current study, instructors were given specific questions to evaluate officers&#8217; memory and remain consistent across officers. The debrief began with the instructor asking the officer to provide an open-ended recall (i.e., &#8220;What did you see and hear?&#8221;), followed by specific probes for aspects of the scenarios the officer did not mention (i.e., &#8220;Then what did you do?,&#8221; &#8220;Did you see the backpack in the corner?,&#8221; &#8220;What was the suspect description provided during briefing?&#8221;). Importantly, instructors first gathered what the officer perceived and remembered in order to avoid engaging in leading questions. Officers&#8217; participation in the current study was not part of their professional duties or training but instead served as baseline performance in a research study on police performance during stress (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, officers&#8217; actions were not corrected following each scenario but rather were discussed and debriefed at the end of the research component (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>To avoid any researcher bias or confounds, the reality-based scenarios were designed by qualified and experienced UOF instructors with more than 10&#8239;years of experience designing occupationally relevant evaluation and training scenarios. These instructors were not part of the research team and were employed by the police agency from which the study sample was derived. In accordance with pedagogical principles for evidence-based police training (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2020</xref>), each scenario was designed to be appropriately challenging in eliciting fundamental police skills of SA, physical tactics (e.g., positioning, maneuvering), and decision-making (i.e., selection of an appropriate force option, UOF implementation) and induce autonomic arousal that is comparable to encounters faced by officers in the field (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Arble et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2019</xref>). To further enhance ecological validity, scenarios were conducted at an empty school to allow for indoor and outdoor scenes &#8216;on location&#8217;. Props were used to enhance reality, including furniture and simulated weapons. Officers&#8217; firearms were loaded with blank ammunition that mimics the sound of live fire, and actors present were police officers and trainers experienced in acting out critical incident scenarios.</p><p>For the current study, all procedures (briefing, scenario, debrief) were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded for cognitive performance. However, only two of the four completed scenarios met the criteria for addressing the current analyses and hypotheses: one excluded scenario did not require a lethal force decision, and cognitive performance scores could not be coded in the second because officers were not consistently asked to recall scenario details during debriefing. HR and demographic information were available for all 57 participants; however, audio recordings were missing for two participants in Scenario 1 and missing for 12 participants in Scenario 2.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Scenario descriptions</title><p>For Scenario 1, officers were called to a home to conduct a &#8216;wellness check&#8217; (i.e., physically confirm an individual&#8217;s wellbeing) on a female as requested by her boyfriend. Entering the scenario, the officer did not know if the individual was experiencing a crisis, had a weapon, or would be violent. Thus, all police tools and options were available to the officer, and the decision about how to resolve the incident had to be based on the officer&#8217;s assessment of the situation. Upon approach to the doorway of the location, a male, who is the boyfriend of the person in crisis, can be heard yelling &#8220;Stop! Why are you doing this?&#8221; He was standing close to a female who was seated, slightly slumped over, with visible blood marks in a line across her upturned wrists. Upon arrival, the officer discovers the male holding a knife in his left hand as he takes it away from the female, whose wounds are self-inflicted. Upon verbal orders and further questioning by the officer, the male immediately dropped the knife, and the female state that she did not want to live any longer (i.e., indicating that she was suicidal). According to agency best practices and instructor criteria, the officer should prone all individuals on the ground, secure the weapon, and call for backup before approaching too closely. The scenario was designed such that the optimal lethal force decision was one of inhibition, meaning a &#8216;no-shoot&#8217; decision was appropriate.</p><p>For Scenario 2, officers were called to a home for a reported break-and-enter. During briefing, a suspect was described to be seen kicking in a door wearing a specific-colored shirt; therefore, deciding to implement a UOF option may be necessary. Upon arrival, the officer discovers two men fighting&#8212;one in a housecoat holding a crowbar, who is the homeowner, and another in a shirt matching the suspect&#8217;s description. The homeowner&#8217;s wife is also present, hiding in the background, and can be heard yelling &#8220;Stop!&#8221; several times. Based on the briefing information, the officer must decipher who is the homeowner and who is the suspect. Given the involvement of a weapon, all police tools and options were available to the officer. Similar to Scenario 1, the homeowner is to immediately comply with officer commands, drop the crowbar, and all individuals should be laid on the ground away from the weapon and kept at a distance until backup is radioed in. The scenario was also designed as a &#8216;no-shoot&#8217; decision, whereby deciding not to use lethal force was appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec8"><title>Heart rate</title><p>Continuous physiological data were recorded at a rate of 1&#8239;Hz (1 recording/s) using Bodyguard 2 cardiovascular monitors (FirstBeat Technologies Ltd., Jyv&#228;skyl&#228;, FI). Monitors were worn by officers for the entire procedure, including during the briefings, scenarios, and debriefing periods. One adhesive electrode patch was applied to the officers&#8217; skin below the left collarbone, and another was applied to the ribcage below the heart. Four cardiovascular measures were analyzed for the purpose of this study: (1) resting heart rate (HRRest), which was recorded at the beginning of the day and averaged over 5&#8239;min of seated rest; (2) maximum heart rate (HRMax) during the anticipatory briefing period before the scenario began; (3) HRMax during the scenario (i.e., between the start and stop whistles); and (4) debriefing HRMax experienced after the scenario. All HRMax values were 5-s averages centered on the maximum HR value achieved during each respective time period.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Cognitive performance</title><p>A coding scheme was created specific to each scenario to assess officers&#8217; use of best practices in the scenario, officers&#8217; post-incident memory of their initial perceptions and actions, and their understanding or sensemaking (i.e., correctly decipher who was the homeowner). It is important to highlight that &#8220;best practices&#8221; are defined as the policies and procedures that the police agency follows in accordance with Canadian legal statutes (i.e., they do not reflect the personal opinions of the researchers).</p><p>Accordingly, cognitive performance was operationalized by the successful execution of specific behaviors during the scenario (e.g., issuing verbal commands) and/or identification of specific items during the instructor-led debrief (e.g., recalling what the actors said) based on notes and transcriptions from audio-recordings. Items were coded as binary scores and grouped into a total of four composite variables, or when only one item existed, represented individually:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Perceptual memory</italic>, assessing officers&#8217; recall of visual and auditory scenario elements.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Procedural memory</italic> of enacting previously trained best practices and complex sensorimotor skills during the scenario.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Action memory</italic>, which is the officers&#8217; memory of whether they implemented certain best practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Understanding</italic> (represented individually), which assessed officers&#8217; ability to build upon their perceptions of the environment and make sense of the dynamics of the situation.</p></list-item></list><p>Individual items included in composite scores are reported in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary materials</xref> for detailed descriptions). Items were coded through verification from transcriptions of the scenario (e.g., the officer gave verbal commands during the scenario, the instructor described the officer placed themselves too close to the actors and therefore used inappropriate positioning), as well as from notes from the instructor and research team (e.g., the instructor noted the officer drew pepper-spray as the force option). Officer memory was coded explicitly for their actions and later memory of what transpired in the scenario and not alternative choices they would have made in hindsight. For each scenario, individual items were summed and converted to a percentage score to reflect cognitive performance for each composite variable as well as for overall cognitive performance.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tab1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics and demographic summary.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Such instances are due to the applied research context, in that live-action reality-based scenarios used by law enforcement for training and evaluation purposes are subject to slight variations despite having pre-determined scripts and outcomes. For instance, the dynamic verbal interactions between actors and officers may slightly differ between individual trials or run-throughs based on what the officer says or does (e.g., an officer issues a verbal command before the actor has a chance to make their scripted statement). Although this is less controlled than typical lab-based experiments, live-action scenarios along with transcribed recordings provide a unique opportunity to examine episodic memory and cognition in policing in a real-world applied setting, with the detailed context of each scenario verifiable for (1) what truly occurred, even if diverging from the pre-determined script, and therefore (2) the accuracy of officer&#8217;s subsequent event memory. We have mitigated the impact of idiosyncratic differences in individual run-throughs by calculating overall cognitive performance for each run-through as a proportion of all available items and excluding the analysis of transcripts from a third scenario that featured inconsistent instructor debriefs and actor performance.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports on the current dataset (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref9003" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2022</xref>), lethal force decision-making was coded as a binary outcome (correct/incorrect), with the correct decision for both scenarios being a &#8216;no-shoot&#8217; response in alignment with the police agency&#8217;s best practices. As most participants did not make a lethal decision-making error (89 and 98%, respectively), there was an inflation of zero-coded actions. To assess the relationship between cognitive performance, physiological arousal, and making a lethal-force decision-making error (i.e., making a &#8220;shoot&#8221; response), making a lethal force error was coded separately (i.e., not included in composite cognitive performance measures). All items were coded by the lead and second authors and Cohen&#8217;s Kappa calculated to assess inter-rater reliability. This found good agreement for cognitive performance items for Scenario 1 (Cohen&#8217;s Kappa&#8239;=&#8239;0.77, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;&lt;&#8239;0.001) and Scenario 2 (Cohen&#8217;s Kappa&#8239;=&#8239;0.81, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;&lt;&#8239;0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Statistical analyses and design</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 20; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">IBM Corp, 2022</xref>) (Version 4.4.1; <xref rid="ref800" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2024</xref>) and R Studio (Version 2024.4.2.764, <xref rid="ref700" ref-type="bibr">Posit Team, 2024</xref>).

As an exploratory analysis, we also wanted to examine the relationship between stress physiology, lethal force errors, and composite scores of cognitive performance using a series of linear mixed effect models. Linear mixed-effects models are robust to data variability and can examine relationships across both scenarios simultaneously, which is important due to the limited instances of lethal force errors and non-normality seen in this data. To examine the relationship between stress physiology and cognitive performance, five models were run predicting overall cognitive performance as well as composite perceptual memory, procedural memory, action memory, and understanding scores by anticipatory HRMax, HRMax during the scenario, and HRMax during debriefing. Age, sex, years of experience, HRRest, and making a lethal decision-making error were entered as covariates, and all models included a random intercept for participant. To examine the relationship between lethal force decision-making, cognitive performance, and stress physiology, a linear mixed-effect model was run with overall cognitive performance, anticipatory HRMax, HRMax during the scenario, and HRMax during debriefing included as predictors, HRRest as a covariate, and participant as a random participant. Given the limited number of errors (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;8), a simpler full model had to be examined without including age, sex, and years of experience. Given that understanding and lethal force errors were single binary scores, these models were run as mixed-effect logistic regressions conducted using the logit function. All models were conducted in a backwards stepwise fashion, removing non-significant predictors to find the most parsimonious model.

Together, these findings suggest that experiencing higher physiological arousal before or during the scenario can promote better memory for using UOF best practices but hinder spatial processing that is central to police tactics and operations.</p><p>Procedural memory for using the correct force option was positively related to perceiving the target weapon (&#961;&#8239;=&#8239;0.560, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;&lt;&#8239;0.001, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;34) and peripheral presence of a female bystander (&#961;&#8239;=&#8239;0.373, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.025, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;36).

Therefore, officers who more accurately perceived the target weapon and actors in play were more likely to use an appropriate force option and less likely to make a lethal UOF error. Similarly, whether officers perceived the female bystander was positively correlated to overall understanding of the situation (&#961;&#8239;=&#8239;0.301, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.045, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;45) and procedural memory for engaging with the female (&#961;&#8239;=&#8239;0.378, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.010, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;45) but negatively related to procedural memory for using the radio (&#961;&#8239;=&#8239;&#8722;0.306, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.041, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;45). Thus, perceiving relevant target and peripheral cues was positively associated with forming more complete understanding.

Greater increases in HR before and during scenarios were associated with increased situational understanding, appropriate use of lethal force options, and fewer lethal decision-making errors. However, this was at the expense of officers using the best positioning and therefore not providing enough time and distance. Lower arousal during the scenario was associated with making lethal force decision-making errors, which led to subsequent impairments in post-incident memory for perceptual information and the officer&#8217;s own actions. Older and more experienced officers showed lower arousal, and female officers showed greater cognitive performance. These findings are discussed in the context of current basic and applied literature, as well as their implications for training procedures in critical incidents and crisis intervention.</p><sec id="sec19"><title>Anticipatory physiological arousal both disrupts and enhances cognitive performance</title><p>Increased physiological arousal before and during critical incident scenarios was associated with improvements in some aspects of cognition but impairments in others. These findings are consistent with both basic and applied police research, showing differential effects of physiological stress responses on cognitive performance (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Arble et al., 2019</xref>). Moderate arousal appeared to play an adaptive role by promoting SA and improving lethal force decision-making accuracy. This may indicate increased vigilance and is consistent with previous findings that a constrained elevation in HR is associated with optimal lethal force decision-making (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Arnetz et al., 2009</xref>). However, if HR is too elevated, perceptual distortions and cognitive and lethal force errors may occur (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, reported decrements to positioning may be accounted for by stress-induced perceptual distortions, such as tunnel vision. Here, attention is directed towards critical external details (e.g., weapon presence) at the expense of self-centered or spatial information (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Novy, 2012</xref>). Spatial processing has previously been shown to be sensitive to stress in healthy and clinical populations, as well as in officers when completing live-action scenarios (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Ellena et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Marlatte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Lewinski et al., 2014</xref>). This may be an area for targeted improvement, especially during high-stress encounters.</p></sec><sec id="sec20"><title>Older and more experienced officers demonstrate reduced engagement</title><p>As expected, we found significantly elevated HR before, during, and after critical incident scenarios relative to rest, indicative of physiological arousal and engagement with the scenarios. However, we observed that older and more experienced officers had lower HR during the scenario and debrief periods, consistent with previous research (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2022</xref>, but see <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Vickers and Lewinski, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Renden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Mangels et al., 2020</xref>). Being more experienced was also related to being less likely to use the correct force option suggesting that older, more experienced officers may have been less engaged during these non-mandatory professional exercises (i.e., a research study). Increased training and on-the-job experience, therefore, do not compensate for a lack of task engagement and resultant arousal, which is necessary for optimal cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><title>Female officers demonstrate better cognitive performance</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report sex differences in police cognition during critical encounters. We found that female officers showed better overall cognitive performance, as well as improved perceptual memory and situational understanding, compared to male officers. This is consistent with basic science findings in episodic memory, where women show more detailed and accurate memory and focus more on the overarching meaning (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Grysman and Hudson, 2013</xref>). Previous applied research showed that female officers self-reported higher stress before navigating critical incidents, which was independent of scenario performance (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2024</xref>). This higher anticipatory stress may actually be enhancing cognition when completing scenarios, leading to greater situational engagement and improved memory. Future studies should examine the interaction of stress and gender to better understand its potentially beneficial relationship to different aspects of scenario performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec22"><title>Lethal decision-making errors as a predictor of post-incident memory</title><p>Committing a lethal decision-making error was the strongest predictor of poor cognitive performance. However, cognitive performance itself did not significantly predict the likelihood of making a lethal force error. This indicates that while officers who made a lethal force decision-making error generally exhibited lower cognitive performance, many others with similarly poor performance did not make such errors. Consequently, reduced cognitive performance alone cannot fully explain the occurrence of lethal force errors. Instead, lower arousal during the scenario emerged as a significant predictor of making a lethal force error, suggesting it may play a critical role as well. Physiological arousal is therefore an important target for intervention in reducing lethal force errors, particularly for achieving moderate levels of arousal that are adaptive (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>The Unease Modulation Model (UMM), a theory of stress relevant to law enforcement personnel, offers a framework to understand how decision errors can impact cognitive functioning afterwards (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Arpaia and Andersen, 2019</xref>). Specifically, a mistake involving the use of lethal force can divert an officer&#8217;s focus from the immediate task to their internal feeling of unease. Because the officer is no longer focused on the skills they need to resolve the event, but rather on their physiological stress response and cognitions about potential occupational repercussions of making a mistake, performance can become impaired. Our findings are aligned with the UMM in that making a lethal force error was associated with increased HR after the scenario, an indicator of unease. As stress during recall can lead to memory impairments, the accumulation of error-induced stress post-scenario could account for the observed impediments in recollection (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Shields et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The fact that perceptual and action memory were selectively impaired by lethal decision-making errors has significant implications for real-world encounters that require long-term recollection for legal purposes (e.g., testimony or investigation of officer-involved shootings). This is of particular importance in situations involving individuals with mental illness, where rates of UOF are higher and reliance on police testimonies may be greater (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Fyfe, 2000</xref>). The current findings highlight the importance of reducing stress physiology during post-incident debrief procedures to enhance memory preservation.</p></sec><sec id="sec23"><title>Training considerations</title><p>Officers generally demonstrated good verbal communication skills. and those who perceived relevant threat-related cues were more likely to implement best practices and select the appropriate UOF option. However, officer positioning was overall quite poor. Experts have identified creating time and distance when interacting with persons in crisis as de-escalation and non-escalation safety strategies, as well as central aspects of police-specific SA (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Huey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Huhta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota et al., 2021c</xref>). Because of this, experts advocate for the incorporation of time and distance training for police officers who engage with individuals in crisis. A model for this specific type of training (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">Decision Model for Police Encounters</italic>) is available in the literature, along with policy recommendations to enhance evidence-based policing (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Huey et al., 2021</xref>). Given the lack of standardization in training and performance measurement across the policing profession broadly, it is unclear whether and how time and distance are trained both conceptually and practically (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Di Nota and Huhta, 2019</xref>). The findings from this study reveal the prevalent use of inadequate positioning, highlighting the pressing need for reform and standardization of current police training models.</p><p>Similarly, increased anticipatory physiological arousal may hinder officers&#8217; <italic toggle="yes">self</italic>-awareness in space, despite improving other aspects of cognitive performance. Recent studies have identified self-awareness, defined as the awareness of one&#8217;s impact on situational outcomes, as one of several elements of overall SA (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Huhta et al., 2022</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Notably, highly experienced officers and police instructors report self-awareness more frequently compared to novice trainees (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Huhta et al., 2023</xref>). Further, there are empirically based police interventions that train adaptive self-regulation skills &#8211; including breathing and body position &#8211; for the purpose of modulating physiological stress responses that might otherwise inhibit good decision-making during encounters with persons in crisis (for example, see <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Employing self-regulation skills before and during scenarios have been shown to promote SA, verbal communication and de-escalation, physical tactics and positioning, as well as reduce lethal force decision-making errors (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The current findings suggest that adaptive self-regulation skill training can be extended to examine their potential benefits to developing officers&#8217; self-awareness more broadly, as well as target post-scenario physiological arousal to possibly offset the negative impact of error-induced stress on officers&#8217; memory.</p><p>Current models of crisis intervention training (CIT) aim to reduce the probability of UOF during incidents involving individuals with mental illness, using scenario-based training that promotes effective communication and de-escalation (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Pelfrey and Young, 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that integrating adaptive physiological self-regulation skills into current models may improve officers&#8217; overall SA. This may lead to more accurate situational understanding and decision-making, which could in turn reduce the use of lethal force in mental health crises. CIT has previously been criticized for being a systemic rather than an individual intervention (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2008b</xref>). It therefore may be an important future direction to incorporate physiological stress modulation tailored to the individual officer to improve the outcomes of police interactions with persons experiencing a mental health crisis (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><title>Moderate arousal levels is associated with optimal cognitive performance</title><p>It has long been theorized outside of police contexts that the impact of stress on cognitive performance depends on achieving an optimal level of arousal (<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Yerkes and Dodson, 1908</xref>). This relationship between arousal and cognition follows an inverted U-shape, wherein moderate levels of arousal improves performance but further increases can lead to impairments. The lower heart rates observed in older officers and those who made a lethal decision-making error may reflect earlier stages of this curve, wherein moderate arousal levels necessary for optimal cognitive performance were not achieved. In contrast, younger and female officers may have been closer to optimal arousal levels, leading to better performance. This inverted U-shaped relationship arises from several brain regions being sensitive to the transient neurotoxic effects of stress (e.g., the hippocampus, implicated in memory and spatial processing, and the prefrontal cortex, which is critical for top-down control of flexible behavior in-the-moment), with each region differing in their degree of sensitivity (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Arnsten, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Arnsten, 2015</xref>). As a result, the same stressor may lead to moderate activation in one region, improving performance in related cognitive processes, and overactivation in another, leading to impairments in other aspects of cognition. This may explain why the same level of arousal seen in officers before the scenarios was adaptive for higher-level cognitive processing, leading to improved understanding and choice of use-of-force option, but exceeded optimal levels for spatial processing, resulting in impairments.</p></sec><sec id="sec25"><title>Limitations</title><p>Inherent in all applied research, our study has limitations, including sample size constraints and the trade-off between realism and experimental control. However, as the scientific literature highlights, all studies, including experimental ones, face constraints on generality (COG; <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Simons et al., 2017</xref>). The COGs inherent in applied, contextualized research are balanced by the recognition that such research is essential for establishing legitimacy in psychological science (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen, 2024</xref>). This is especially true in understanding police interactions with individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. With this in mind, the COGs in this study indicate that our results may be most relevant to the experiences of Canadian officers in medium-to-large urban agencies, such as those in our sample. However, we also note that while there are some differences in police best practices across agencies, the policies and best practices regarding lethal force decision-making remain largely consistent with those of international police organizations. Thus, we recommend the reader to keep these limitations and benefits in mind while interpreting the findings of this study.</p><p>Further considerations include the following: data were coded from notes and transcriptions from audio-recorded scenarios, which are less detailed than other methods (e.g., video recordings) but were used following agency allowances. Additionally, not all officers experienced the exact same stimuli due to slight differences in scenario execution by the actors or in debriefing procedures, which was mitigated in multiple ways (see <italic toggle="yes">Cognitive Performance</italic> in Methods). The noted heterogeneity is common in applied research settings, as stringent experimental control of all variables is often not possible and would undermine the ecological validity of police training in field contexts as it does not reflect the dynamic interactions police are required to navigate in the real world.</p><p>Similarly, different scenarios elicit different responses in individual officers; therefore, it is not possible ensure a wide range of lethal decision-making errors. We believe it is not ethical to experimentally manipulate officers into making lethal force errors to inflate the number of errors to increase statistical reliability (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen, 2024</xref>). While this may lead to higher degrees of variability in model estimates, as seen here, we mitigated the impact that rare outcomes have on statistical analyses by using approaches for zero-inflated variables and analyzing across multiple scenarios simultaneously. Given the limited sample size and number of scenarios, these results offer exploratory insights into the nuanced relationship between the physiological stress and police memory and cognition, which merits further study. Although correlational in nature, these analyses do provide some understanding to the temporal contingency of how stress impacts aspects of cognition in realistic, applied settings and lays the foundation for future work in this area.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found a complex relationship between stress physiology and officers&#8217; cognitive performance during reality-based scenarios involving individuals in mental health crisis. An optimal amount of arousal before and during scenarios was found to be necessary for the best cognitive performance but comes at the cost of officers&#8217; spatial awareness. Reduced arousal during scenarios can lead to lethal force errors, which are associated with increased arousal after the scenario and can result in impaired memory. Our findings reinforce existing empirical research showing that age and years of experience do not automatically result in better skills and performance, and reveal that female officers display better cognitive performance and situational understanding, a novel finding which future studies should explore further.</p><p>These findings highlight the need for training that integrates physiological self-regulation and targets officer&#8217;s self-awareness. We also urge policy makers and police agencies to revise existing training models to include time and distance considerations as methods of de-escalation and non-escalation. Together, these changes can improve officers&#8217; cognitive performance, reduce lethal force errors, and mitigate stress-related impairments for all involved, ultimately improving outcomes during encounters with individuals in a mental health crisis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The researchers would like to extend their sincerest thanks to all the police officers and administrators who volunteered for the study.
