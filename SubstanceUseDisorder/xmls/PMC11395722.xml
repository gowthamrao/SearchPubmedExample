Older individuals with obesity who survived a stroke (&gt;65 years) and had a recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) hospitalization, with or without prior bariatric surgery (PBS), were identified using ICD-10 codes. Recurrent stroke trends, demographic characteristics, and comorbidities between the cohorts were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analyzing 643,505 older individuals with obesity who survived a stroke, we identified that 11,820 had undergone PBS. Both groups (no PBS vs. PBS) were predominantly female (59.7&#160;% vs. 73.7&#160;%), identified as white (76.5&#160;% vs. 83.8&#160;%), and covered by Medicare (91.7&#160;% vs. 90.7&#160;%). Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, prior myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular diseases were more common in those without PBS. In contrast, tobacco use disorder, drug abuse, and valvular diseases were more common in those with PBS. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension between groups.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2019, recurrent AIS hospitalizations were less frequent in the PBS group (4&#160;%&#8211;2.9&#160;%, p&#160;=&#160;0.035) while remaining stable in the other group (4.4&#160;%&#8211;4.2&#160;%, p&#160;=&#160;0.064).

Despite this overall decrease, the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients has been shown to escalate with age [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This upward demographic trend underscores the heightened vulnerability of older patients to not only an increased risk of ischemic stroke but also to its associated, more severe outcomes and a higher mortality rate [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Concurrently, the global prevalence of obesity in adults has surged over the past decade [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Obesity in older individuals is exacerbated by physical inactivity and limited access to nutritious foods [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, obesity, being a critical risk factor for stroke, has also been associated with poorer functional recovery, underscoring the importance of addressing this issue in stroke prevention and management [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this context, bariatric surgery emerges as a potential intervention, offering a pathway to substantial weight loss and the reduction of obesity-related complications in adults. A 2022 update to the 1991 guidelines supports considering bariatric surgery for those with <funding-source id="gs5">BMI</funding-source> &gt;35 and 30&#8211;34.9 in those with metabolic disease [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Given the increasing aging population in the world and the compounded risks associated in patients with obesity and stroke in older individuals (&#160;&#8805;&#160;65 years), it is crucial to examine the outcomes of ischemic stroke in this population group who have undergone bariatric surgery.

After adjusting for all baseline demographics and comorbidities, the association remained significant (aOR: 0.77 [95&#160;% C.I. 0.60&#8211;0.98]), suggesting that bariatric surgery may be protective against this outcome even when considering other influencing factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0080">The study presented investigates the impact of bariatric surgery on the incidence of recurrent acute ischemic stroke hospitalizations among older individuals with obesity with a history of stroke. Our findings present compelling evidence that bariatric surgery may serve as a significant protective measure against hospitalizations for the recurrence of acute ischemic strokes in older individuals with obesity with a history of stroke by 23&#160;%. The reduced odds remain significant even after adjustment for age, gender, race, income, and comorbidities.</p><p id="p0085">Bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by 51&#160;% in a pooled analysis of observational studies [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Williams et&#160;al., in their analysis, found the procedure to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by 46&#160;% in one year and 22&#160;% in five-year follow-ups [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, amongst stroke survivors, bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the odds of all-cause mortality by 42&#160;% during their hospitalizations [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our study adds further value by suggesting that bariatric surgery may protect against hospitalizations for stroke recurrence in older individuals with obesity who have survived a stroke.</p><p id="p0090">In addition to our findings related to stroke recurrence, our study also provides insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of older individuals with obesity who have survived a stroke. The higher prevalence of females in the bariatric surgery group could reflect gender-specific healthcare behavior or differences in willingness to undergo the procedure. Moreover, the differences in racial composition and socioeconomic status between the groups point to potential disparities that may influence access to, and hence the outcomes of, bariatric surgery and stroke care. While hypertension remained the prevalent comorbidity in both groups, notable differences in other comorbidities, specifically the higher prevalence of prior myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus in the non-surgical group, highlight a cumulative risk factor burden that further underscores the protective potential of bariatric surgery.</p><p id="p0095">Our trend analysis underscores a consistent decrease in the percentage of recurrent stroke hospitalizations over the observed period (2016&#8211;2019) among the bariatric surgery cohort, juxtaposed against a relatively stable incidence in the non-surgical group. This finding may be influenced by survivorship bias. Individuals at higher risk of recurrent stroke may have experienced such events early in the study period (notably in 2016), leading to a natural diminution in the incidence of recurrent strokes in subsequent years due to the attrition of high-risk individuals.</p><p id="p0100">Bariatric surgery is a complex and invasive procedure, and it is not suitable for all individuals. The older population is at a higher risk of complication rates from the surgery. Hence, the decision to undergo bariatric surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [DM Pechman 2019]. This approach emphasizes the importance of patient-centered care and informed clinical judgment.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="p0105">It is imperative to approach our findings with an understanding of the study's limitations. Being observational in nature, we cannot provide causal inferences. The reliance on administrative data in our study introduces potential biases due to limitations in coding and reporting. While coding for obesity is specific [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [K Suissa 2022], it lacks sensitivity, often missing patients with obesity, as they are not coded as such. This may affect the representativeness of our study population and limit the generalizability of our findings to the broader population in the community. Additionally, the analysis may not be sufficiently powered to fully understand the effects of survivorship bias on the downward trend of recurrent stroke hospitalization in the bariatric surgery cohort. Furthermore, the nature of our data limits a detailed examination of the different types of bariatric surgery, quality of healthcare delivery, treatment compliance to comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, the influence of provider approach to healthcare delivery, the specific BMI for each cohort, and their respective associations with recurrent stroke hospitalization.</p><p id="p0110">Despite these limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential benefits of bariatric surgery beyond weight loss&#8212;specifically, its role in reducing the risk of stroke recurrence in a vulnerable population segment. However, prospective and randomized studies are required to establish the optimal role of bariatric surgery in managing older individuals with obesity who survive a stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0115">Analyzing data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2019, our study investigated the impact of bariatric surgery on hospitalizations for recurrent stroke in older individuals. The study found that hospitalizations for recurrent stroke decreased over time in patients who had undergone bariatric surgery compared to those who had not. Despite limitations such as the observational design, potential coding biases, and survivorship bias, our findings suggest that bariatric surgery is a viable intervention to lower stroke recurrence
