This review provided the comprehensive and recent evidence for the treatment of LEAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing the short-term or long-term outcomes between EVR and OSR of LEAD were identified. Short-term outcomes were 30-day mortality, major amputation, wound complication, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and length of hospital stay (LOS), while long-term outcomes included overall survival (OS), amputation-free survival (AFS), freedom from re-intervention (FFR), primary patency (PP), and secondary patency (SP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>11 RCTs and 105 cohorts involving 750,134 patients were included in this analysis. For the pooled results of cohort studies, EVR markedly decreased the risk of 30-day mortality, wound complication, MACEs, LOS, but increased the risk of OS, FFR, PP, and SP. For the pooled outcomes of RCTs, EVR was associated with obviously lower 30-day mortality, less wound complication and shorter LOS, but higher risk of PP, and SP. However, both RCTs and cohorts did not show obvious difference in 30-day major amputation and AFS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both the pooled results of cohorts and RCTs indicated that EVR was associated with a lower short-term risk for LEAD, while OSR was accompanied by a substantially lower long-term risk. Therefore, the life expectancy of LEAD should be strictly considered when choosing the revascularization modality. As the current findings mainly based on data of retrospective cohort studies, additional high-quality studies are essential to substantiate these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Systematic Review Registration</title><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#recordDetails" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#recordDetails</ext-link>, identifier CRD42022317239.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lower extremity artery disease</kwd><kwd>open surgery</kwd><kwd>endovascular</kwd><kwd>revascularization</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd><kwd>peripheral artery disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Provincial Health Research Project</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn001">AHWJ2022a031</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Shanghai Jiaotong University</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn002">Jyhz2101</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Shanghai Jiao Tong university School of Medicine</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn003">JYZZ161</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Anhui Provincial Health Research Project (AHWJ2022a031), the top priority of nursing research in School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University (number: Jyhz2101), and the Fundamental research program funding of Ninth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong university School of Medicine (JYZZ161).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="0"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Atherosclerosis and Vascular Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is currently an important global problem, affecting nearly 200 million people (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is the manifestation of PAD in the lower extremities and is also the main disease of PAD. The primary symptom of early-stage LEAD is intermittent claudication, while rest pain and gangrene of limbs occur with the progress of LEAD (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In 1997, the Rutherford classification was recommended to describe lower extremity ischemia and is still widely applied (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). According to this classification, the end-stage of LEAD is also termed chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), which includes ischemic rest pain and tissue loss (Rutherford 4&#8211;6). The main treatment of LEAD is revascularization. If there is no timely revascularization, 20% of CLTI patients will have to receive major amputation surgery within a year, and the overall mortality will reach to 22% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, timely and effective treatments are crucial for LEAD patients.</p><p>To date, endovascular revascularization (EVR) and open surgical revascularization (OSR) are the two most common options for revascularization of LEAD patients. EVR is mainly composed of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy, and stenting, while OSR is treated by surgical bypass and endarterectomy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Presently, the optimal option of revascularization is debatable. Several previous studies revealed that OSR is accompanied by low long-term mortality (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Abu Dabrh et al. concluded that there is no statistical difference between EVR and OSR in long-term mortality (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A recent meta-analysis by Wang et al. revealed that OSR reduces the long-term mortality of CLTI patients but increases the risk of short-term mortality and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACEs) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, several articles fulfill the inclusion criteria have been ignored (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and a large number of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published after 2018 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

Exclusion criteria: (1) patients with the iliac aortic disease; (2) studies written in non-English text; (3) case report, case series, letter to editor, review and animal research.

Two independent reviewers (SH, XX) conducted this selection. Any inconsistency in study selection was settled by discussing with a third reviewer (HQ).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Data extraction and outcomes of interest</title><p>Data were extracted by two independent reviewers (SH, XX) using a standardized Microsoft Excel file, and discrepancies were resolved by discussing with a third reviewer (HQ). The following items were extracted: the first authors' s name, year of publication, country, study design, disease stage, population characteristics, endovascular intervention, open surgery, number of patients, average age, and time of follow-up. Data were preferentially selected if shown as data after propensity-matching. The data of follow-up were shown as the maximum time-point of the Kaplan&#8211;Meier curve. For study in the absence of full text, we sent an email to authors to obtain relevant information.</p><p>The outcomes of interest included short- and long-term outcomes. 30-day and in-hospital outcomes were deemed as short-term outcomes that comprised 30-day mortality, major amputation, wound complication, MACEs, and length of hospital stay (LOS); while long-term means more than 1-year which comprised overall survival (OS), amputation-free survival (AFS), freedom from re-intervention (FFR), primary patency (PP), and secondary patency (SP) were considered as long-term outcomes.</p><p>We assessed the quality and risk of bias of enrolled studies using the Newcastle&#8211;Ottawa scale (NOS) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or Cochrane risk of bias tool (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Two reviewers (HQ, SH) independently processed the assessment. For cohort studies, NOS was applied to assess quality. A cohort study with an NOS score &lt;6 was regarded as high-risk and should be excluded from the current study. Studies with NOS scores of 6&#8211;7 and 8&#8211;9 were deemed to be at moderate risk and low risk, respectively. Regarding Cochrane Collaboration's tool, the risk of bias 2.0 tool (RoB 2.0) will be used to assess the quality of RCTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized for binary variables. Meanwhile, weighted mean difference (WMD) with its 95% CI was applied for continuous variables. For time-to-event data, hazard ratio (HR) with standard error (SE) was obtained from original articles and pooled according to the generic inverse-variance method. If an original article did not contain HRs and SE, HRs and SE were obtained using the Tierney method (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Due to the possible heterogeneity among the enrolled studies, the outcomes of this study were combined with the random-effects model using the Der Simonian-Laired method, and the inter-study heterogeneity was expressed with <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> values (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). For the 30-day mortality and OS, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were carried out to explore the sources of heterogeneity with respect to the following perspectives: study design (prospectively cohort, retrospective cohort), regional characteristics (Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Australia), sample size (&lt;1,000, &gt;1,000), and disease stage (according to information provided by the author in original studies, patients were divided into three groups: Rutherford 1&#8211;3, Rutherford 4&#8211;6, and Rutherford 1&#8211;6). For all outcomes, a leave-one-out analysis was conducted as a sensitivity analysis to explore the stability of each outcome. The funnel plots and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value of Egger's test were constructed to estimate publication bias; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 of Egger's test indicated the potential publication bias (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) v0.9.5.10 Beta software was utilized to conduct the TSA for 30-day mortality (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The required information size (RIS) and the trial sequential monitoring boundary (TSMB) were calculated under the following conditions: relative risk reduction of 20%, the first type of error (<italic toggle="yes">&#945;</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.05), and power of 80%. The sample size of the accumulated evidence was sufficient when the RIS threshold was crossed by the cumulative <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-curve; otherwise, the sample size is inadequate and additional studies are still needed. Furthermore, the results showed significant differences if the cumulative <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-curve passed the TSA threshold. In this study, a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant, except for a <italic toggle="yes">P-</italic>value &lt;0.10 in the chi-square test. All data analyses were carried out using Review Manager V5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, K&#248;benhavn, Denmark), Stata 17.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), and TSA v0.9.5.10 Beta software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The process of study selection was shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>.

Meanwhile, the pooled outcomes of RCTs also revealed EVR is associated with better short-term outcomes, including 30-day mortality, wound complication, LOS, while OSR is associated with better long-term outcomes, including PP, SP. However, both RCTs and cohorts did not show significant difference in 30-day major amputation and AFS.</p><p>Three relevant meta-analyses were conducted on LEAD patients (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The first meta-analysis by Abu Dabrh et al. revealed that EVR and OSR have similar long-term mortality (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Some methodological concerns explained the difference in their conclusions from those of the current study. Firstly, many eligible studies were ignored, which could affect the pooled results. Secondly, study by Bergan et al. and Wolf et al. enrolled the same patients from 1 RCT (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, 199); therefore, their results should not be merged (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thirdly, data from cohorts and RCTs should not be combined due to different study designs. The second meta-analysis conducted by Wang et al. revealed a conclusion similar to the current study (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Their meta-analysis was very well written and their conclusions were valuable references to treatment of CLTI. However, their review focused only on the end-stage of LEAD, whereas the current study focused on the patients in all stages of symptomatic LEAD, as the patients with intermittent claudication should also receive revascularization when medical therapy is inadequate (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Notably, some eligible studies were not included in their review, which would affect the merged outcomes, our study is the most comprehensive. Meanwhile, patients in the study Dosluoglu 2009 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and Dosluoglu 2012 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) were reduplicative and should not be simultaneously included. Furthermore, the exclusion criteria of Wang et al. did not contain iliac aortic diseases, while the present only focused on the occlusion of lower limb arteries, which is emphasized in the Methods section. The TSA method was performed in the current study compared to these two previous reviews. The required sample size was estimated to be 279,101, and the cumulative <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> curve met the required sample size and conventional threshold that affirmed the validity of our study. Recently, an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, conducted by Farhan S et al, also revealed that EVR was associated with less early complications and shorter length of hospital stay than OSR, which was accordant with the current analysis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The methods of revascularization for LEAD have always been controversial. Recent guidelines indicated that the trend of EVR for LEAD had increased markedly in recent years with the advances in endovascular technology and its characteristics of minimally invasive (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Thus, some surgeons advocated EVR as the first choice for LEAD, while OSR is the second option (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, EVR is usually accompanied by injury to vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which promote the proliferation of VSMCs and cause restenosis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For OSR therapy, adequate inflow and outflow and an appropriate autogenous vein are essential but are not easily obtained in many end-stage LEAD patients (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, comprehensive evidence is an urgent requirement for the treatment of symptomatic LEAD patients. The current review concluded that life expectancy is a critical factor and should be considered when choosing the revascularization modality.</p><p>Since heterogeneity was observed in the present review, sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses were performed. Sensitivity analyses revealed that our combined data were stable and consistent. The results of meta-regression indicated that regional characteristics might be the potential source of heterogeneity. The subgroup analyses conducted according to the regional characteristics revealed that our 30-day mortality and OS data were mainly from the America. Reasonably, the pooled results of America subgroup were approximated to the whole group. A previous study also found that racial differences lead to variations in LEAD risk and presentation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, these results should be interpreted carefully as most studies were conducted in the America, and future studies should focus on the influence of regional characteristics on the prognosis of LEAD.</p><p>Nevertheless, the present study has some limitations. Firstly, only 11 RCTs were enrolled, and most of the included cohort studies were retrospective, which might cause a selection bias. The current study also showed that some combined results of RCTs and cohorts were different; as only 11 RCTs were included, more high-quality RCTs are essential. Secondly, substantial heterogeneity was noted across studies, but the sensitivity analyses revealed that our pooled data were stable and consistent. Finally, we did not define the specific modalities of EVR and OSR as inconvenient to obtain the original data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the results of cohort studies revealed that EVR is associated with lower short-term risk, including 30-day mortality, wound complication, MACEs, and LOS but higher long-term risk, such as OS, FFR, PP, and SP. Meanwhile, the results of RCTs were consistent with cohort studies in 30-day mortality, wound complication, LOS, PP and SP, which further validated the reliability of above results. Life expectancy is a critical factor for determining the specific revascularization method. For elderly patients, EVR seems to be an appropriate option, while OSR seems to be a more suitable treatment for younger patients. However, as the current findings are mainly based on retrospective cohort studies, high-quality studies are required to validate our conclusion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Many thanks to Raju Datheputhe for the English revision of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec"><bold>Supplementary Material</bold></xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s7"><title>Author contributions</title><p>RW, QH, XX, and HS conceived the original study concept and overall study design.
