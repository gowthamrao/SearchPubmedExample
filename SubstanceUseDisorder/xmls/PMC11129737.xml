Utilizing the resource-based view of the firm, this study aimed to investigate the association between electronic health record (EHR) implementation and financial performance in high Medicaid NHs. A positive correlation could allow high Medicaid NHs to leverage technology to enhance efficiency and financial health, thereby establishing a business case for EHR investments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data from 2017 to 2018 were sourced from mail surveys sent to the Director of Nursing in high Medicaid NHs (defined as having 85% or more Medicaid census, excluding facilities with over 10% private pay or 8% Medicare), and secondary sources like LTCFocus.org and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services cost reports. From the initial sample of 1,050 NHs, a 37% response rate was achieved (391 surveys). Propensity score inverse probability weighting was used to account for potential non-response bias. The independent variable, EHR Implementation Score (EIS), was calculated as the sum of scores across five EHR functionalities&#8212;administrative, documentation, order entry, results viewing, and clinical tools&#8212;and reflected the extent of electronic implementation. The dependent variable, total margin, represented NH financial performance. A multivariable linear regression model was used, adjusting for organizational and market-level control variables that may independently affect NH financial performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Approximately 76% of high Medicaid NHs had implemented EHR either fully or partially (n = 391).

According to the National Center for Health Statistics,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> there are approximately 15,600 nursing homes in the U.S., with 1.7 million licensed beds, and 1.3 million residents. In the past few decades, for-profit corporate chains have emerged as the dominant ownership form in the nursing home industry. For-profit chains operate 66% of nursing homes, with the largest ten chains owning over 10% of all beds.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Nursing homes serve vulnerable individuals who are often physically and cognitively challenged, acting as a safety net for older adults and people with disabilities. The nursing home industry operates in a highly competitive and resource-constrained environment.</p><p>Medicaid is the largest purchaser of nursing home services.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, a recent government report has estimated that the median Medicaid base payment rate was 86% of reported facility costs. Furthermore, nursing homes that serve a high proportion of Medicaid-covered residents tend to receive lower reimbursement rates.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To compensate, nursing homes cross-subsidize Medicaid residents by offsetting lower reimbursement rates with more lucrative payments from Medicare and private-pay residents. However, nursing homes with high Medicaid census face further constraints due to their heavy reliance on Medicaid for a significant portion of their funding. Yet, they operate under the same staffing and other regulatory requirements limiting their ability to cut costs.</p><p>Mor et al<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have argued that the lopsided payer mix mechanism prevalent in the nursing home industry results in a distinct two-tiered system, with Medicaid-dependent facilities falling into the lower-tier category. The high Medicaid nursing homes (defined as having a Medicaid census of 85% or more, private-pay census of 10% or less, and Medicare census of 8% of less), struggle with poor quality of care, as evident through increased health-related deficiencies and chronic nurse staffing shortages.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The inadequately remunerative payer mix of high Medicaid nursing homes is also reflected in their relatively poor financial performance. Unaddressed financial difficulties can not only lead to a further decline in quality but also result in insolvency and closures, affecting the availability of institutional long-term care in rural and other underserved areas.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As high Medicaid nursing homes disproportionately serve the poor and minorities; it is imperative to improve their performance if the goal of elevating nursing home quality is to be realized.</p></sec><sec id="s0001-s2002"><title>Electronic Health Records</title><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> (CMS) defines an Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a
<disp-quote><p>digital version of a patient&#8217;s paper medical chart that contains information about the patient&#8217;s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results.</p></disp-quote></p><p>There is a broad academic and policy consensus that nursing homes would benefit from EHR implementation.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> EHR can enhance the accessibility and sharing of resident information, reduce medical errors through applications such as alerts and reminders, and improve practice efficiency resulting in greater revenue capture and reduced costs.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;14</xref> Nursing home researchers have also reported that implementing EHR can yield substantial resident quality of care benefits such as reduced medication errors, fewer urinary tract infections, improved adverse incidence reporting, and increased immunization rates.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;17</xref></p><p>Prior literature has associated higher quality in nursing homes with improved financial performance; facilities that performed better on quality exhibited higher operating margins.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, EHR implementation in high Medicaid nursing homes has the potential to concomitantly address the two critical challenges administrators face: quality and financial performance.</p></sec><sec id="s0001-s2003"><title>The Rationale for This Study</title><p>Despite its purported impact on performance, nursing homes lag in EHR implementation.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Various factors have contributed to the relatively slow implementation of EHR systems within the nursing home industry such as financial challenges and policy choices, particularly exclusion from the meaningful use (MU) incentive program.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The MU program, initiated as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, was designed to incentivize the adoption of EHRs to improve quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care. However, the program predominantly targeted acute care settings, omitting nursing homes from its provisions.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> An additional hurdle arises from the fact that most existing EHR systems are primarily designed for acute care settings. Given that NHs often have their own unique requirements, such as specific medication dosing protocols and distinct reporting and regulatory needs, this misalignment can deter NHs from implementing EHRs.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Experts and regulatory agencies have explicitly acknowledged the need to increase EHR penetration in nursing homes.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These calls for action highlight the importance of addressing the barriers to EHR implementation within the nursing home industry to improve resident care and the overall operational efficiency.</p><p>Financial concerns are one of the main obstacles impeding wider EHR implementation in nursing homes.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Installing EHR systems is expensive as it involves investing in hardware, data migration, training, information technology (IT) support, and supporting ongoing maintenance costs.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>High Medicaid nursing homes with their lean financial resources may be particularly reluctant to invest in expensive EHR systems for two reasons: low Medicaid reimbursement and uncertainty about future revenues. Moreover, state budget-led constraints on Medicaid spending may further dampen the appetite for large capital investments, given the ambiguity surrounding the return on investment (ROI).<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Therefore, high Medicaid nursing homes face a conundrum: though they would potentially benefit the most from EHR implementation, financial limitations and fiscal challenges limit their willingness to invest in EHR systems. How do we encourage EHR implementation in high Medicaid nursing homes? Short of direct policy interventions, one approach could involve building a business case that showcases the positive impact of EHR on financial outcomes.</p><p>Although several studies have assessed the impact of EHR on hospital financial performance,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the empirical evidence in the nursing home industry is scarce. Hitt and Tambe<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> have reported that operating costs were 2.3% higher for nursing homes that implemented EHR. However, their study was limited to a single state, and the data may be outdated. The absence of recent research that has investigated the influence of EHR implementation on nursing home financial performance represents a significant knowledge gap. This study is motivated by the need to address this substantial void in the existing literature.</p><p>This study contributes to the literature in three specific ways. First, utilizing primary data, it offers a national-level examination of the impact of EHR implementation on nursing home financial performance. The primary data gathered are one of the strengths of this study, as the data on EHR implementation in administrative datasets are limited to a single dichotomous variable. Second, by focusing on high Medicaid nursing homes that serve a higher proportion of marginalized populations, the findings may significantly improve the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable Americans. Finally, the conceptual model and the employment of a rigorous analytical design, including controlling for organizational and market factors that may independently influence nursing home financial performance, lend credibility and strength to the findings of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s0001-s2004"><title>Conceptual Framework</title><p>The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm was used to examine the relationship between EHR implementation and financial performance. RBV posits that differences in firm performance can be explained by variations in their internal resources, and these differences remain stable over time, allowing firms to pursue value-creating strategies that result in sustained competitive advantage.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Adapting Bharadwaj&#8217;s<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> taxonomy, nursing home EHR-based resources are classified as the following: a) tangible resources comprising the physical EHR infrastructure, b) the human EHR-based resources comprising the technical and managerial skills and c) intangible EHR-based resources such as knowledge assets and synergy.</p><p>The physical EHR resources encompass components such as scheduling systems and clinical decision support systems. While these resources are not unique in themselves, when customized and integrated to meet specific facility needs, they gain value and can provide a strategic competitive advantage.</p><p>Human EHR skills encompass technical proficiency in using EHR components and managerial capabilities like project management.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> RBV argues that while individual human resource (HR) practices can be replicated, the unique HR systems and routines that develop over time contribute to the creation of specific human capital skills, offering a distinct competitive edge.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Furthermore, RBV explicitly recognizes the role of intangible organizational resources such as culture and reputation, which can be enhanced through EHR implementation and improved market responsiveness.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For instance, nursing homes may exploit EHR as a reputational &#8220;signaling device&#8221; to indicate higher quality. This approach could increase their market share and prompt a shift in their payer mix towards more financially advantageous Medicare/private pay residents.</p><p>Based on the preceding discussion, nursing home EHR-based resources can be classified as valuable, inimitable, rare, and organization-wide supported resource serving as a fount of sustained competitive advantage,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> an avowed consequence of its attainment is superior economic performance.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Improved financial performance may be derived from increased revenues and/or reduced costs. Hospitals may favor nursing homes with electronic patient information sharing, prioritizing these facilities for the more remunerative post-acute care patients (Medicare). Moreover, EHR systems can directly improve quality, resulting in higher ratings within the CMS nursing home five-star quality rating system. Research shows a consumer preference for facilities awarded a 5-star rating.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Revenues may also increase due to comprehensive charge capture and resource utilization group optimization. Simultaneously, cost reductions may arise from improved workflow efficiency, reduced expenditures on paper and transcription costs, and an overall reduction in waste.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35&#8211;37</xref> In summary, EHR implementation can result in increased revenues as well as lower costs, translating into improved financial performance (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Ownership identified whether a nursing home was for-profit (0), not-for-profit (1) or government-owned (2). Chain affiliation reflected whether the nursing home was part of a chain (0 = freestanding; 1 = chain affiliated). Evidence suggests that for-profit chain affiliated nursing homes generally report better financial performance.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Size captured the total number of beds within the nursing home. Larger nursing home would be expected to benefit financially from economies of scale and shared efficiencies. Occupancy rate was the percentage of occupied nursing home beds. It ranges from 0 to 100 where a higher number indicated more occupied beds in a facility. Higher occupancy rates often correlate with better financial performance due to increased revenue, allowing for better cost distribution across more residents. The presence of NPs/PAs reflected whether the nursing home utilized a NP/PA (0-no presence of NP/PA; 1 = presence of NP/PA). The presence of NPs/PAs in nursing homes can lead to better financial performance by optimizing patient care delivery and reducing hospital readmissions. Nurse staffing reflected three measures: registered nurse (RN) hours per resident day (PRD), licensed practical nurse (LPN) hours PRD, and certified nursing assistant (CNA) hours PRD. Nurse staffing is perhaps the most potent determinant of nursing home quality,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and the literature has associated higher quality with better financial performance.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The acuity index is a measure of care needed by residents in a nursing homes. It was calculated based on the number of residents requiring assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), such as bed mobility, transferring from bed to chair, as well as those needing special treatments like physical therapy or tube feeding. The acuity index ranged from 0 to 24, where the larger number indicated a resident requiring more specialized care.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The proportion of racial/ethnic minorities was the proportion of nursing home residents who were Black, Hispanic, and other race/ethnicity. Evidence suggests that nursing homes with higher proportion of minority residents experience poorer financial performance.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Market level variables included socio-economic factors that may affect the supply and demand for long-term care, and therefore the availability of environmental resources. Market factors were captured at the county level. Market variables included competition, Medicare Advantage (MA) market penetration, per capita income (U.S. dollars), unemployment rate, poverty level, education level, location (1 = urban, 0 = rural), and the proportion of population 65 and older.</p><p>Market competition was assessed through the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a metric that evaluates market concentration within an industry. It was calculated by summing the squared value of each nursing home&#8217;s market share based on inpatient days, with values ranging between 0 and 1. Higher values suggest greater market concentration, indicating more monopolistic markets, while lower values indicate higher competition. Nursing homes located in more competitive markets may experience inferior financial performance due to reduced pricing power. MA market penetration was calculated as the proportion of all Medicare beneficiaries in the county enrolled in an MA (managed care) plan. Research suggests that counties with higher MA penetration are more competitive.<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Per capita income is a measure of the average income of individuals in a county. Poverty level is the percentage of persons in the county in poverty. The unemployment rate refers to the percentage of individuals within a specific county&#8217;s labor force actively seeking employment but currently unemployed.<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Education level captured the percentage of population in the county that has greater than a high-school diploma. Counties with a higher per capita income, lower poverty level, lower unemployment rate, higher educational level, and urban location are expected to have greater environment munificence, resulting in better financial performance.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Proportion of population 65 and older was calculated at the county level, with total county population as the denominator. A higher proportion is expected to correlate with increased demand for nursing home care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0002-s2003"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>To adjust for potential non-response bias, we included propensity score weights in the regression analysis.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The propensity score weights were calculated as the inverse of the propensity scores, using a logistic regression model where the outcome variable (respondent = 1, non-respondent = 0) was regressing on the following variables: occupancy, payer-mix, size (total beds), acuity index, chain affiliation, ownership status, resident racial/ethnicity mix, nurse staffing ratios, competition, Medicare Advantage penetration rate, unemployment rate, poverty level, education level, location, and the proportion of population 65 and older. Then, the inverse of the propensity score and the propensity score weight was calculated and included in the models. Respondents had higher occupancy rate and were more likely to be not-for-profit, compared to non-respondent nursing homes. On every other metric, both groups were similar.</p><p>As the dependent variable (total margin) was normally distributed, multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship between EHR implementation (EIS) and financial performance (total margin), adjusting for both organizational and market-level variables. Stata 16 was utilized for data management and analysis, and statistical tests were evaluated at the 0.05 level of significance.

id="s0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>Drawing from the tenets of RBV, this study aimed to investigate the association between EHR implementation and financial performance within high Medicaid nursing homes. This research focused on high Medicaid facilities because they are classified as the &#8220;lower tier&#8221; among nursing homes, are under-resourced, and experience poor quality of care. These facilities often cater to marginalized populations, and improving their performance could address disparities within the nursing home industry. This study provides encouraging new evidence that these resource-constrained nursing homes may be able to improve their financial performance through EHR implementation.</p><p>Previous nursing home studies have reported sharply variable EHR implementation rates ranging from 18% to 84%,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> whereas the EHR implementation rates in hospitals and physician offices consistently exceed 90%.<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The results suggest that only 44% of high Medicaid nursing homes had a fully implemented and operational EHR. Although the samples are different and the definitions of EHR vary across studies, high Medicaid facilities appear to be trailing behind the average U.S. nursing home in EHR implementation.</p><p>As hypothesized, EHR implementation was associated with better financial performance (total margin). Nursing homes that implement EHR systems might experience increased revenue realization through improved coding efficiency, optimal utilization of available reimbursement methods, and accurate recording of comorbid illnesses.<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> EHR-linked documentation management, medication safety, adverse event reporting, reduced time to access resident data, and claims management are some of the elements that may enhance efficiency and lower costs in nursing homes.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Savings in operating expenses could also stem from a reduction in redundant tests, costs related to paper records, chart pulls, and transcription.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Finally, nursing homes may be able to achieve a more lucrative patient profile by leveraging EHR implementation to signal superior quality, thereby enhancing their market power.</p><sec id="s0004-s2001"><title>Managerial and Policy Implications</title><p>This study should provide cautious optimism to administrators of high Medicaid nursing homes wrestling with the decision to invest in an EHR system while still navigating a financially precarious environment. The findings suggest a positive correlation between EHR implementation and profitability, offering a compelling incentive for administrators to prioritize investments in EHR systems. However, the data also reveal a significant gap between EHR implementation for relatively mundane administrative tasks, and its application in more complex clinical operations, which require a higher level of employee training. Therefore, to realize the full potential of EHR systems, healthcare organizations must continue investing in both IT infrastructure and human resources.</p><p>Policymakers and regulators may not be overly concerned with nursing homes&#8217; financial performance, but their viability and the ability to deliver a minimally adequate level of care are certainly important considerations. Poor financial performance can result in nursing home closures, significantly affecting access to long-term care, particularly in underserved communities.<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> An important reason nursing homes lag hospitals and physician offices on EHR implementation is because they were excluded from the subsidies provided by the HITECH Act.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Consequently, a financial incentive structure analogous to the HITECH Act may be required to stimulate EHR implementation in nursing homes, particularly those with high Medicaid populations.</p><p>Even if subsidies were extended to nursing homes, policymakers might have a legitimate concern: would facilities, especially those with high Medicaid census, have the financial wherewithal to make the ongoing investments required to fully leverage their EHR systems? Establishing a business case for EHR implementation outlines a potential scenario wherein subsidies stimulate the initial implementation, while the financial gains encourage facilities to perceive EHR systems as an asset rather than a regulatory burden. Furthermore, the importance of efficient and accurate health information exchange has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic which disproportionately affected nursing homes.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Thus, a business case for EHR implementation could ensure continued investments, making EHR systems sustainable and beneficial in the long term.</p><p>This study presents certain limitations. First, our study sample was limited to high Medicaid nursing homes. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to the larger nursing home population. To address this, future studies should investigate the financial impact of EHR implementation across a more diverse array of nursing home settings. Second, our criteria for defining high Medicaid nursing homes, although based on previous literature, may be deemed overly restrictive considering the significant changes that have occurred in the nursing home environment over the past two decades. Therefore, future research should examine potential revisions to these criteria to evaluate their relevance and accuracy. Third, a cross-sectional study contributes to the extant literature; however, it cannot evaluate longitudinal effects over time. Additionally, nursing homes with better financial performance may be more inclined to implement EHR. Future studies that collect longitudinal data may offer a more nuanced understanding of the evolving financial impact of EHR systems in nursing homes. Fourth, despite our best attempts to measure EHR implementation, there is a need to better operationalize the combined effects of individual EHR functionalities, as done in the case of hospitals.<xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Future research should quantitatively assess the contribution of individual EHR functionalities to nursing home performance as that may lead to more precise and actionable findings. Furthermore, it is important to note that the data for our study were collected in 2017&#8211;2018, prior to the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has profoundly altered the landscape of nursing home operations, making it imperative to utilize more recent data to assess the current state of EHR implementation in nursing homes and its impact on performance. Finally, we must acknowledge the possibility of survey response bias as nursing homes that have implemented or are planning to implement EHR have a higher likelihood of responding to surveys of this nature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of EHR implementation on the financial performance of high Medicaid nursing homes. The results indicated a positive influence, demonstrating how EHR systems may financially benefit resource-constrained nursing homes that are responsible for the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable Americans. The findings of this study offer a rationale for targeted policy efforts to ensure that U.S. nursing homes are no longer the laggards in EHR implementation. It is untenable to exclude nursing homes from incentives available to other sectors of the U.S. healthcare system. For nursing home administrators, the results highlight a potential business case for EHR implementation, with the long-term financial gains outweighing the initial burden of implementation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The abstract of this paper was presented at the Gerontological Society of America&#8217;s Annual Scientific Meeting (2022) as an oral presentation with interim findings.
