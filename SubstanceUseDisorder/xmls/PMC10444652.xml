Cancer, its treatment, and non-cancer co-morbidity can all cause pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pharmacological cancer pain management in the UK commonly emulates the WHO Analgesic Ladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which advocates a proportionate, step-wise approach from non-opioid analgesics to weak opioids, followed by strong opioids for analgesia. Antineuropathic agents, including antidepressants and anticonvulsants, and other adjuvants, are also used for controlling pain in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">With the emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic (the pandemic), healthcare delivery and utilisation changed dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Public and professional uncertainties and anxieties, both in anticipation and during the height of the pandemic, affected how palliation was managed in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the UK, national guidelines included measures to minimise virus transmission to both patients and healthcare workers, incorporating reduced face-to-face consultations in primary and secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

We present a retrospective, observational study examining the impact of the pandemic on opioid and antineuropathic prescriptions in the Welsh primary care setting for both newly diagnosed cancer patients and patients who died from cancer.

WLGP contains prescribing and other GP event data from approximately 80% of all Wales general practices. The prescribing data included the exact date of prescription for each drug item and are coded using Read codes. Read codes for analgesics were classified into analgesic groups according to the UK Biobank &#8216;Primary care codings&#8217; annotation in the May 2020 edition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Medicine names and analgesic groups are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par12">Cohort I was selected to provide a relatively stable group of cancer patients (in terms of prescribing), in contrast to the end-of-Life patients in Cohort II. A 15-month survival period was used for Cohort I so that at least 12 months of prescribing data were available. This did not include the 3-month period defined as end-of-life care, which tends to have a different approach to analgesic prescriptions. Patients who experienced end-of-life care during the study are represented by Cohort II and data relating to the 3 months prior to their death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Diagnosis data for Cohort I patients, including cancer type and diagnosed stage, came from two sources (Cohort I in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Data for patients diagnosed between 2017-01-01 and 2018-12-31 came from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence &amp; Surveillance Unit (WCISU) database, the National Cancer Registry for Wales. As a provider of official statistics, WCISU data are subject to approximately two years delay before release. To meet the urgent requirement of assessing the impact of the pandemic on cancer care and services in Wales, the Rapid Cancer Diagnosis Dataset (RCDD) was created, providing data for patients diagnosed from 2019-01-01 onwards. In RCDD, records of newly diagnosed patients in secondary care inpatient hospital admissions data (Patients Episodes Dataset for Wales, PEDW) and outpatient appointments data (Outpatients Database for Wales, OPDW) were added to the list of newly diagnosed cases recorded in the Welsh national electronic clinical cancer patient record system (Cancer Network Information System Cymru, CaNISC), to achieve data completeness for newly diagnosed cases. The following International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes were used for cancer type extraction: female breast cancer (C50), colorectal cancer (C18, C19, C20), NSCLC (C33, C34), and prostate cancer (C60).</p><p id="Par14">For Cohort II, records of all patients who died with a cancer (ICD-10 codes C00-C97 excluding C44) as the underlying cause were extracted from the Annual District Death Extract (ADDE), which contains the information of all deaths relating to Welsh residents.</p><p id="Par15">Demographic information included week of birth, sex, and deprivation based on place of residence as assessed by the Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) version 2011, linked to the socioeconomic status for each individual's Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) version 2019 (Welsh Demographic Service Dataset, WDSD) with health factor of the local areas excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Only patients with both a Welsh residence address and a Welsh GP registration at diagnosis (for Cohort I) and patients who died as Welsh residents (for Cohort II) were included.

Cohort II represents cancer patients in the last 3 months of life, who are likely to have specific oncological needs. Cohort I includes patients who survived 15 or more months from diagnosis and will include asymptomatic healthy patients, patients who have been radically treated, patients with chronic malignant disease of variable morbidity, and patients with actively relapsing disease which is either locally advanced or metastatic. In Cohort I, analgesia will be used for a variety of reasons, including non-cancer comorbidity. As an overall sample, Cohort I is a reasonable comparator for the more dynamic and focussed requirements of Cohort II patients.</p><p id="Par37">We found that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a general increase in community prescription of opioid and antineuropathic analgesics for patients in Wales within the first 12 months of cancer diagnosis (Cohort I) and for cancer patients within 3 months of cancer-related death (Cohort II). Amongst the two broad analgesic groups, and the two opioid sub-groups (strong and weak opioids) evaluated, significant increases in the quantity of prescriptions were identified in both opioid (strong opioids especially) and antineuropathic prescriptions for both cohorts. A significantly higher proportion of patients within 3 months of cancer-related death were given strong opioids and antineuropathics during the pandemic period, when compared to pre-pandemic. Prescription of weak opioids showed a decreasing trend in the pandemic period. These findings are consistent with changes in community prescribing to compensate for pandemic-related service changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], including reduced access to specialist hospital-based cancer services and/or reduced specialist supervision and medication chart rationalisation, and an emphasis on primary care-based palliation. Further investigation of secondary care analgesic use will be beneficial in interpreting these results more fully.</p><p id="Par38">We observed a spike in opioid prescription for Cohort I patients diagnosed in Q2 2020 and for Cohort II patients who died in Q2 2020. This appears to be an isolated effect, coinciding with the start of UK pandemic measures. Similar spikes in non-cancer patients have been recorded in Wales for non-analgesic community prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and in England for both analgesic and non-analgesic community prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and the hypothesis is that this represents a form of stockpiling in anticipation of reduced availability. These spikes may be the result of either patient-initiated prescription requests, a more systematic primary care initiative, or a combination of the two. The prescription spikes do not necessarily equate to an increase in consumption.</p><p id="Par39">Our study is able to monitor sequential repeated prescriptions over time in primary care. It is perceived that each sequential record for prescription occurs when patients are running out of drugs, which is a proxy for daily usage and adherence of drug items prescribed for managing cancer-related pains.</p><p id="Par40">Prescription patterns are influenced by socioeconomic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and our data are consistent with this. For Cohort II patients, socioeconomic variations were less pronounced and the range was more compressed compared to Cohort I. We hypothesise that this is due to closer supervision of patients with increasingly complex and dynamic needs and demands towards the end of life. In this setting, there will likely be a regular review of medication charts, and analgesic prescription will likely be consistently applied and mainly tailored towards cancer-specific symptoms. In contrast, the variation seen in Cohort I likely reflects a combination of looser medication supervision, and a wider range of symptomatology, including analgesia for pain not directly attributable to cancer, or caused by non-malignant comorbidity, which also displays a social gradient.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par41">Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not included in this analysis, despite being some of the most commonly used analgesics. These may be prescribed, but are commonly bought across the counter, so usage is only partially ascertained in prescription analysis. Tablets or capsules containing codeine 8mg plus paracetamol 500mg may also be purchased without a prescription in the UK. In addition, this study only looks at the number of discrete analgesic prescriptions.</p><p id="Par42">While Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) are a more robust measure for prescribed items and the presence of it in the electronic records adds to the granularity of the data included in the current analysis, our focus in this study was to monitor the impact of the pandemic on prescription of each drug category. Further research on adherence and individual base item usage per day would add to the insights provided in this study.</p><p id="Par43">Some of these patients will have received hospital or hospice prescriptions, which are not captured in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">With national-scale linked data, we demonstrate significant changes to community analgesic prescription patterns for cancer patients over the course of the UK pandemic, superimposed upon pre-existing sociodemographic variation, with increased opioid and antineuropathic prescriptions for both newly diagnosed patients and patients receiving end-of-life care. The latter patient population also had a higher chance of receiving an analgesic prescription compared to pre-pandemic times. These effects reflect UK and Wales pandemic-related healthcare policy changes, as well as local primary care coping strategies, and changes in health-seeking behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
