Synthetic grafts or crosslinked animal-derived biological grafts are characterized by significant adverse reactions, which are mostly observed after their implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the decellularization protocol to produce a completely acellular full-thickness abdominal wall scaffold. Methods: Full-thickness abdominal wall samples were harvested from Wistar rats and submitted to a three-cycle decellularization process. Histological, biochemical, and DNA quantification analyses were applied to evaluate the effect of the decellularization protocol. Mechanical testing and immunogenicity assessment were also performed. Results: Histological, biochemical, and DNA analysis results showed efficient decellularization of the abdominal wall samples after the third cycle. Decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds were characterized by good biochemical and mechanical properties. Conclusion: The data presented herein confirm the effective production of a rat-derived full-thickness abdominal wall scaffold. Expanding this approach will allow the exploitation of the capacity of the proposed decellularization protocol in producing acellular abdominal wall scaffolds from larger animal models or human cadaveric donors. In this way, the utility of biological scaffolds with preserved in vivo remodeling properties may be one step closer to its application in clinical studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abdominal wall</kwd><kwd>decellularization</kwd><kwd>hernia</kwd><kwd>tissue reconstruction</kwd><kwd>biomechanical analysis</kwd><kwd>full-thickness abdominal wall scaffold</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-bioengineering-10-00913"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The restoration of abdominal wall defects as a result of trauma, infection, congenital conditions, complications of abdominal surgeries, neoplastic diseases, and others belongs among the most routinely performed surgeries in the general population [<xref rid="B1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among these defects, incisional hernias that occur after laparotomy are exhibited in 5&#8211;20% of patients, and their repair represents a highly demanding reconstructive surgery [<xref rid="B2-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is estimated that more than 700,000 surgeries for abdominal wall reconstruction are performed in the United States annually and more than 20 million are performed globally each year [<xref rid="B1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mostly, abdominal wall surgery and herniation can lead to significant complications, including muscle weakness and collagen ratio disturbance [<xref rid="B5-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Regarding the latter, it has been already described in the literature that the amount of collagen I reduces, while the amount of collagen III increases, resulting in alterations in abdominal wall tensile strength and mechanical stability [<xref rid="B5-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In accordance with the aforementioned information, the proper reconstruction of abdominal wall defects requires the use of scaffolds characterized by specific biomechanical properties to support tissue regeneration and deep wound healing [<xref rid="B9-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nowadays, a great number of commercially produced synthetic scaffolds are used as implants for abdominal wall reconstruction [<xref rid="B1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Synthetic scaffolds can be produced using either biodegradable or non-biodegradable materials. Polyglycolic acid (PLGA) and polyglactin 910 (PLGA 910) are biodegradable materials, which are degraded through the hydrolysis process [<xref rid="B12-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this way, tissue-resident macrophages can efficiently degrade these materials into monomers, which further can be deposited into the regenerated ECM. However, abdominal wall reconstruction performed with biodegradable materials results mostly in scar tissue formation at the injury site [<xref rid="B15-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This in turn can result in complications due to scar tissue formation, impairing tissue integrity and mechanical resistance. Unfortunately, new reconstructive surgery to replace the formed scar tissue is required [<xref rid="B18-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, polypropylene (PP) and expanded tetrapolyfluorethylene (ePTFE) belong to the category of non-biodegradable materials with good biomechanical properties and tissue reinforcement [<xref rid="B19-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although these materials have good properties, severe adverse reactions, such as calcification and host immune system activation, have been reported in the majority of cases [<xref rid="B1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other factors, such as the body mass index (BMI) and post-operative wound infection, also should be considered for the selection of a proper scaffold for the functional reconstruction of the abdominal wall [<xref rid="B22-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, patients with BMI &gt; 30, accompanied by other health issues, such as diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by a higher risk ratio of ventral hernia formation due to the increased stress of the abdominal wall [<xref rid="B22-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, patients with a smoking habit, prior ventral hernia restorations, and infections related to hernia repair may exhibit a great number of postoperative complications following the use of either biodegradable or non-biodegradable materials. Moreover, a meta-analysis study conducted by Darahzereski et al. [<xref rid="B23-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that synthetic materials used for hernia restoration have an infection rate of 36.5% compared to 10.9% of biological scaffolds. </p><p>Considering the aforementioned findings, scaffolds derived from different origins, e.g., a natural plant-based or an animal-derived ECM, must be evaluated as a potential new strategy for abdominal wall reconstruction. In the context of tissue regeneration, biological scaffolds composed of a native or glutaraldehyde crosslinked ECM have been used in the past with limited success [<xref rid="B24-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, after long-term implantation, aberrant host immune responses have also been reported [<xref rid="B26-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Immune system activation includes mostly the polarization of macrophages into the M1 phenotype, the activation of CD4 T cells, and the migration of Th1 and B cells to the implantation site, which further leads to calcification and tissue rejection [<xref rid="B26-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the production of biological scaffolds using advanced tissue engineering approaches, such as decellularization, may overcome the aforementioned issues [<xref rid="B29-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Decellularization relies on the use of a combination of physical and chemical methods, leading to cellular loss and the production of an acellular matrix [<xref rid="B30-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The decellularized ECM can beneficially support cell adhesion, survival, proliferation, and differentiation compared to synthetic or crosslinked scaffolds [<xref rid="B31-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The former is related also to better biomechanical properties, which can lead to improved tissue reconstruction at the injury site [<xref rid="B32-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nowadays, the use of scaffolds obtained from decellularized matrices is comprehensively investigated as a pioneer tissue engineering approach and alternative therapeutic strategy for several life-threatening diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), bone defects, and dental and craniofacial issues [<xref rid="B29-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Different research groups have elaborated on protocols for the successful decellularization of abdominal wall scaffolds of animal origin [<xref rid="B36-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The application of a decellularization protocol can be easily performed in a great variety of tissues, although the preservation of the full-thickness ECM comprises a highly demanding task. For this reason, the literature regarding the successful production of full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds is limited [<xref rid="B36-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], yet the needs for reconstructive surgery demand the production of such structures. In the past, perfusion decellularization was proposed for the production of whole-organ scaffolds; however, this process is laborious and requires advanced equipment and well-trained personnel [<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Despite the broad use of the decellularization method in different tissues and organs, serious issues concerning extensive ECM damage in the produced scaffolds have still been reported [<xref rid="B39-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, a damaged ECM is characterized by advanced difficulties in (a) performing functional restoration of the injury site, (b) repopulation by resident cells, and (c) achieving in vivo remodeling based on the new microenvironment requirements. Eventually, this could lead to unfavorable results related to the implanted scaffold, such as extensive calcification, an immune response, and graft rejection [<xref rid="B39-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on our previous experience, we validated a cost-effective perfusion-free decellularization method (avoiding extended incubation times of the ECM with the decellularization solutions), which can potentially be applied as an alternative method for the production of full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds [<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the production of an acellular scaffold originating from full-thickness rat-derived abdominal wall samples. For this purpose, our optimized decellularization protocol consisting of three cycles was applied to full-thickness rat-derived abdominal wall samples. The evaluation of the decellularized abdominal wall ECM was performed using methods such as histological analysis and biochemical and DNA quantification. Furthermore, the biomechanical properties of the abdominal wall before and after the decellularization approach were also investigated. The obtained results may lead to significant conclusions regarding full-thickness abdominal wall decellularization to be used in large-scale experimental procedures. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-bioengineering-10-00913"><title>2.

Indirect immunofluorescence against &#945;-gal (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and collagen type I (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was performed, as previously described. Secondary PE-conjugated monoclonal antibody (1:50) against &#945;-gal epitopes and FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody (1:500) against collagen type I were used for the detection of the aforementioned proteins. Finally, all samples were dehydrated, glycerin-mounted, and examined using the LEICA SP5 II confocal microscope coupled with LAS Suite v2 software (Leica Microsystems, Weltzar, Germany).

Histological and Biochemical Evaluation of Decellularized Full-Thickness Rat-Derived Abdominal Wall</title><p>To properly evaluate the decellularization process of the full-thickness rat-derived abdominal wall, histological and biochemical analyses were initially performed. The abdominal wall represents a complex tissue including a combination of circumferential and longitudinal fibers, and for this purpose, the histological analysis involved the evaluation in both axes. A total of three decellularization cycles was required for the efficient production of acellular whole abdominal wall scaffolds. By the end of the third decellularization cycle, the acellular whole abdominal wall scaffolds appeared translucent, indicating furthermore the proper elimination of the resident cellular populations (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>In addition, the ECM integrity of the decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds was retained properly among all layers of the tissue (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). No cracks or other destruction evidence was observed in the produced decellularized whole rat abdominal wall scaffolds (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). To better assess the decellularization efficacy, H&amp;E staining was initially performed. The removal of the resident cells was initially observed after the first decellularization cycle; however, total cell and nuclear material elimination was detected by the end of the third decellularization cycle (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Once the cell elimination was confirmed with H&amp;E staining, further evidence regarding the ECM composition of the acellular whole abdominal wall scaffolds was obtained based on the performance of Orcein, Sirius Red, and Toluidine Blue stains. Moreover, Sirius Red staining revealed the preservation of collagen fibers in both circumferential and longitudinal directions in the decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds. No destruction or change in the collagen fiber alignment was detected between native and decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds (after the third cycle). However, the abdominal wall is characterized by the presence of a low elastin amount, and in our case, it was difficult to be detected based on the performance of the Orcein stain; however, no significant change was observed between non-decellularized and decellularized abdominal wall samples (after the third cycle). In contrast, sGAGs in the decellularized abdominal wall appeared to be affected by each decellularization cycle (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, after the accomplishment of each decellularization cycle, Toluidine Blue staining (specifically stains sGAGs) was weaker. Finally, the acellular full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds produced (after the third cycle) were characterized by a significant loss of sGAGs, as indicated by the Toluidine Blue staining.</p><p>DNA quantification and biochemical analysis were performed to validate further the composition of the decellularized whole rat abdominal wall. Specifically, the DNA content after each decellularization cycle was statistically significantly reduced (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Non-decellularized samples contained 1363 &#177; 87 ng of DNA/mg dry tissue weight (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="app1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>), while the DNA content of decellularized samples was 542 &#177; 73, 167 &#177; 35, and 48 &#177; 12 ng DNA/mg dry tissue weight after the first, second, and third cycles, respectively. The hydroxyproline content, which corresponds to collagen, was reduced statistically significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p =</italic> 0.021) in decellularized samples. The hydroxyproline content of non-decellularized samples was 26 &#177; 5 &#956;g/mg dry tissue weight. The hydroxyproline content of decellularized samples after the first, second, and third cycles was 22 &#177; 4, 20 &#177; 3, and 20 &#177; 2 &#956;g hydroxyproline/mg dry tissue weight, respectively (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="app1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). The sGAG content of non-decellularized samples was 9.1 &#177; 1.7 &#956;g sGAGs/mg dry tissue weight, while decellularized samples had 5.3 &#177; 1.7, 2.1 &#177; 0.6, and 1.1 &#177; 0.3 &#956;g sGAGs/mg dry tissue weight, respectively (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="app1-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>).

In addition, indirect immunofluorescence against collagen type I in combination with the DAPI stain was performed to validate further the decellularization process. The results of indirect immunofluorescence showed the preservation of collagen type I in decellularized whole abdominal wall scaffolds (after the first, second, and third cycles) in both axes. However, the DAPI stain, which was specific for the cell nuclei, gradually lost its intensity signal after the first decellularization cycle (<xref rid="bioengineering-10-00913-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To confirm these results, the determination of the MFI of collagen type I and DAPI stain was performed in all samples.

For this purpose, the application of a non-immunogenic biological scaffold using state-of-the-art tissue engineering methods for abdominal wall defect restoration may represent a promising alternative source of transplants. This study aimed to produce full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds using a validated decellularization approach. For this purpose, rat-derived abdominal wall samples were decellularized appropriately to produce acellular non-immunogenic biological scaffolds to serve as potential grafts for future abdominal wall tissue restoration. Histological analysis revealed that complete decellularization of full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds was achieved after the accomplishment of the third cycle. Cell removal was initiated after the first decellularization cycle; however, complete cell and nuclear remnants were eliminated by the end of the proposed protocol. In addition, decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds (after the third decellularization cycle) were characterized by the preservation of collagen, a significant ECM component. In contrast, sGAGs appeared to be significantly removed after the application of the decellularization protocol. Regarding the elastin content, in addition to its low presence in the abdominal wall, no significant alteration between non-decellularized and decellularized samples was observed. The preservation of collagen in decellularized samples was further confirmed with indirect immunofluorescence (against collagen type I in combination with DAPI). Moreover, collagen type I fibers in decellularized samples retained their alignment both in the circumferential and in the longitudinal axis in the same way as the non-decellularized samples. The preservation of collagen type I in decellularized samples is of significant importance, being one of the major proteins of the ECM structure, thus contributing to a great number of processes, such as hemostasis performance and regulation of the wound-healing process in the injured area [<xref rid="B41-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition to its function in tissue healing, collagen type I plays a significant role in the recruitment and attachment of specific cellular populations to the wounded region through binding to arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid (RGD) binding motifs [<xref rid="B34-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B42-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Indeed, various cellular populations, such as fibroblasts, pericytes, and mesenchymal stromal cells, can bind to collagen fibers through the interaction of &#945;1&#946;1, &#945;2&#946;1, and &#945;&#957;&#946;1 with the RGD binding motifs of well-aligned collagen fibers, thus further promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B34-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B42-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Specifically, it has been shown that integrin-mediated binding with the RGD motifs can lead to an important intracellular signaling cascade through the upregulation of ILK&#8211;NF-&#954;b and GSK3&#946;&#8211;AP1&#8211;cyclinD1, promoting in this way cell survival, migration, and proliferation to the injured site [<xref rid="B41-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition, sGAGs also play an important role in collagen fiber orientation, and their loss after the decellularization process may affect the ECM structure and mechanical properties of the scaffold produced [<xref rid="B51-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, the results of this study seem to be in accordance with previously performed works, where also significant differences in the sGAG content were observed in decellularized samples. Importantly, in the studies by Luo et al. [<xref rid="B53-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and Gui et al. [<xref rid="B54-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the levels of the sGAG content of decellularized heart valves and umbilical arteries, respectively, were lower compared to the non-decellularized tissues. This can be explained by the knowledge of the anionic nature of SDS, which is used as a basic detergent in all these studies [<xref rid="B30-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SDS can interfere with the negatively charged sites of sGAGs and thus can efficiently remove them from the decellularized tissues [<xref rid="B30-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B52-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>These results regarding collagen, sGAG, and cell removal were also confirmed with quantification assays performed in this study. Importantly, cell removal was further confirmed by the low levels of the DNA content isolated from decellularized samples. Indeed, the performance of each decellularization cycle appeared to be lower compared to the previous one. Finally, after the third decellularization cycle, the DNA concentration was below 50 ng/&#956;L dry tissue, thus confirming further the criteria for successful tissue decellularization, as outlined by Gilbert et al. [<xref rid="B30-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Crapo et al. [<xref rid="B55-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, the DNA concentration was determined through the measurement of a 260 nm/280 nm ratio with a spectrophotometer, avoiding in this way false quantification results occurring using commercial kits, such as the Picogreen assay. Most of these commercial kits determine only double-stranded (ds) DNA, without measuring single-stranded (ss) DNA, which may also be present, especially in decellularized tissues [<xref rid="B52-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B56-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Using a spectrophotometer, genetic material quantification is most accurate, representing better the DNA content of the decellularized tissues. It is also widely known that both ds- and ssDNA can initiate a specialized immune response against the implanted graft, which could result in significant adverse reactions to the host [<xref rid="B52-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B56-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Biomechanical properties play an important role in tissue mechanics and therefore were evaluated before and after the decellularization process applied to the full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds. Interestingly, the decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds were characterized by higher values of &#963;<sub>Trans</sub>, &#949;<sub>Trans</sub>, &#963;<sub>UTS</sub>, &#949;<sub>UTS</sub>, El-E, and Col-E compared to the non-decellularized samples, suggesting the adaptation of a stiffer behavior by the produced scaffolds. Also, differences in biomechanical properties were observed after each decellularization cycle. Overall, the increase in abdominal wall scaffold strength is related to the ECM structure. Considering that collagen fibers are responsible for the preservation of tissue integrity during overload differences in the corresponding anatomical area, changes in collagen orientation play an important role in the altered mechanical properties of the produced scaffolds. In addition, the decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds were characterized by greater extensibility than the non-decellularized samples, which is further related to the disorganized collagen fiber alignment. To assess the relationship between the ECM structure and biomechanical properties, extensive histological analysis of all study samples in both circumferential and longitudinal directions was performed in this study. However, histological analysis results did not reveal any change in the collagen fiber orientation (in both axes). Moreover, the indirect immunofluorescence results against collagen type I confirmed further the results obtained from the histological staining, thus confirming the preservation of collagen fiber alignment after the decellularization procedure. In addition to collagen fibers, elastin fibers also play an important role in tissue mechanical strength and extensibility. However, the elastin content of the abdominal wall is relatively low and elastin fibers are mostly disorganized compared to other tissues, such as elastic vessels (e.g., thoracic or abdominal aorta). However, no change in the elastin content was observed between non-decellularized and decellularized abdominal wall samples. The explanation regarding the stiffer behavior of the decellularized scaffolds may be attributed to the cellular population elimination in the produced scaffolds. Indeed, SMCs and ECs, in addition to their important role in other biological processes, have the ability to retain the orientation of collagen fibers, thus contributing further to the preservation of ECM integrity. Based on the histological analysis, the collagen fibers in the non-decellularized samples were fully crimped, while in the decellularized scaffolds, they became uncrimped after each decellularization cycle. In addition to this phenomenon, the reduction in the sGAG content observed in decellularized scaffolds may also play a role in collagen crimping. It is known that sGAGs form large polymers called proteoglycans, which actively contribute to collagen crosslinking [<xref rid="B58-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The significant reduction in sGAGs, in combination with cellular elimination, may lead to an important change in collagen crosslinking, thus affecting further their crimping. Similar alterations in biomechanical properties have also been revealed in the past in other structures, such as the aorta, intestine, and elastic vessels, and have been extensively reported by Sexton et al. [<xref rid="B59-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], Stehbens et al. [<xref rid="B60-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], Sokolis et al. [<xref rid="B61-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and Stergiopoulos et al. [<xref rid="B60-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Specifically, Stergiopoulos et al. [<xref rid="B62-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] indicated in their model that the alteration of the biomechanical properties acquired by decellularized scaffolds cannot be the mere result of cellular elimination only but that further structural ECM changes may provoke altered mechanical behavior. In a similar way, there is substantial evidence for the physical link between SMCs, ECs, and ECM components, which may further contribute to the existence of residual forces in the abdominal wall. However, decellularization causes alterations at both structural and cellular levels of the ECM; thus, prestressed fibers no longer exist, and this may be the explanatory cause of the stiffer behavior of decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds. In addition to this evidence for altered mechanical properties, stiffer abdominal wall scaffolds have been observed in other studies conducted with similar preparation methods. Specifically, Sanchez et al. [<xref rid="B36-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Buell et al. [<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and Chiu et al. [<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated decellularized abdominal wall constructs with similar biomechanical properties as those presented herein. The immunogenicity of decellularized scaffolds constitutes another important parameter for them to serve as potential biological grafts. To assess whether the proposed decelluarization protocol can be submitted for the preparation of acellular scaffolds of animal origin, the determination of &#945;-gal epitopes was performed. Complete elimination of &#945;-gal epitopes was achieved after the third decellularization cycle, as indicated by histological and quantification analysis results. &#945;-Gal epitopes have been considered main immunogenic antigens and have been related to hyper-acute rejection when xeno-transplantation was performed in the past [<xref rid="B63-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Currently, there is a great amount of effort to produce &#945;-Gal-epitope-free knockout pigs, which can offer a solution for a global shortage of organs; however, this attempt is costly [<xref rid="B66-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In the context of biological scaffold production originating from animal models, the decellularization method could potentially assist with this issue. SDS, a detergent of decellularization, is known for its ability to break hydrophobic interactions and ionic and hydrogen bonds, and thus, it can successfully remove negatively charged proteins and genetic material. In this way, SDS has been shown to have the potential to interfere with &#945;-gal epitopes, forcing their elimination by the tissue&#8217;s ECM. Although efforts to remove animal-derived antigens from biological scaffolds have been made, &#945;-gal epitopes have been found in transplants, such as heart valves, SIS-ECM, and vessel grafts, impairing the graft longevity after transplantation [<xref rid="B63-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this study, the proposed decellularization protocol successfully eliminated &#945;-gal epitopes from the produced scaffolds, thus decreasing their potential immunogenicity upon implantation [<xref rid="B68-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Moreover, molecular and cytometry analysis revealed the absence of both cellular populations, e.g., ECs and SMCs, and other antigenic epitopes, e.g., <italic toggle="yes">RT1 classes I</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">II</italic>. RT1 class I and class II comprise the analog genes of histocompatibility in rats [<xref rid="B71-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Histocompatibility antigens are actively implicated in transplantation and graft survival, and their removal may be related to the production of universal biological transplants. In a previous study conducted by our lab, the same decellularization protocol was applied in human umbilical arteries, where also the elimination of HLA class I and II antigens was confirmed after the accomplishment of a comprehensive shotgun quantitative proteomic analysis [<xref rid="B73-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. These results suggest further that the proposed decellularization protocol successfully produces low-immunogenic full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds derived from Wistar rats. The study presented herein demonstrates a proof-of-concept protocol for the production of acellular full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds for potential use as transplants. In this study, an already established decellularization protocol, which has been validated by our research team in several tissues and organs, including the human umbilical cord artery, Wharton&#8217;s jelly tissue, the esophagus, and kidneys, was evaluated for the proposed tissue [<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B50-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B73-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In the past, other research groups have also tried to produce full-thickness abdominal wall scaffolds, with contradictory results. Specifically, Chiu et al. [<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated the production of the porcine acellular dermal matrix (ADM) decellularized with the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO<sub>2</sub>). Chiu et al. [<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] successfully produced the ADM with this method; however, both the ECM ultrastructure and the main components appeared to be significantly affected by SCCO<sub>2</sub>. There was a significant difference between non-decellularized and decellularized samples regarding the histological stain intensity. In addition, ADM samples under higher magnification were characterized by alterations in ECM integrity. In contrast, in our study, no alteration in histological stain intensity between non-decellularized and decellularized samples (from the first, second, or third cycle) was observed. Only the sGAG content was affected by the proposed decellularization protocol, as confirmed by both histological and quantification results. However, in the majority of the studies focused on the production of decellularized scaffolds, a similar loss of sGAGs has been observed [<xref rid="B40-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B53-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B73-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Moreover, sGAG content loss and cellular population elimination are responsible for the altered mechanical properties of acellular scaffolds. In addition, although the studies conducted by Sanchez et al. [<xref rid="B36-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Buel et al. [<xref rid="B37-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have indicated the production of acellular abdominal wall scaffolds, the tissue ECM was affected in a similar way as in the study by Chiu et al. [<xref rid="B38-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Taking into account the available data from the literature, in our study, a comprehensive evaluation of the decellularized scaffold histology (circumferential vs. longitudinal axis) was performed in order to reach safe conclusions.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study clearly showed the successful production of a full-thickness rat-derived abdominal wall scaffold. Moreover, major immunogenic epitopes, such as &#945;-gal and RT1 class I and II antigens, were removed; thus, the produced scaffolds were characterized by low immunogenicity. Considering our results, in the near future, a second study will be primarily prepared, where implantation of the produced full-thickness decellularized abdominal wall scaffold will be performed in an animal model in order to investigate deeper the behavior of the transplant in terms of mechanical strength, capability for tissue integration, non-immunogenic nature, and also underlying tissue remodeling mechanisms. The proposed decellularization protocol could be assessed for the production of acellular abdominal wall scaffolds derived from larger animal models (porcine origin) or human cadaveric donors. Furthermore, this study exploited the possibility of the production of non-immunogenic acellular meshes, with good tissue integrity and mechanical properties, that potentially could be used as transplants in abdominal wall defects. Such acellular biologic scaffolds, with in vivo tissue remodeling properties, may be considered superior to the current gold-standard methods (e.g., synthetic scaffolds). Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the properties of decellularized biologic scaffolds is required to be performed in the future to ensure appropriate FDA clearance. Moreover, specific regulatory concerns regarding the use of decellularized abdominal wall scaffolds, especially those derived from cadavers, should also be considered before their commercialization [<xref rid="B32-bioengineering-10-00913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Under these circumstances, the ultimate goal will be the use of these scaffolds by clinicians in the near future, bringing them one step closer to their clinical utility.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

Hematoxylin staining was only evident in non-decellularized samples, which further confirmed the presence of cell nuclei. No hematoxylin staining was weaker after each decellularization cycle. Decellularized samples after the 3rd cycle were characterized by the absence of hematoxylin stain, thus confirming further the removal of cellular materials. No alteration in Orcein staining between non-decellularized and decellularized samples was observed either in the circumferential (<bold>A5</bold>&#8211;<bold>A8</bold>) or in the longitudinal (<bold>B5</bold>&#8211;<bold>B8</bold>) axis.
