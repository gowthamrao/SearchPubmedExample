Oncologists treating patients with NSCLC were recruited for study participation from 23 regions of the Russian Federation. Eligible patients were prospectively included, or their relevant medical record data were retrospectively analyzed by the participating physicians using a protected, online-based data collection form. Patient data were depersonalized and anonymous. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the principal investigators and the Russian Society of Clinical Oncology (RUSSCO) Independent Ethics Committee. All patients provided their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Patient Selection</title><p>In this study, patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>)&#8211;negative metastatic NSCLC were screened. To be eligible, patients were required to have confirmation of <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic> rearrangement via diagnostic procedures (fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, or polymerase chain reaction) used in the molecular testing RUSSCO national program and to be age 18 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Patients were included if treatment with crizotinib or the investigator&#8217;s choice of platinum-based chemotherapy had been initiated as first-line or later therapy for metastatic <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>-positive NSCLC between January 2016 and January 2017.

Patients who were treated with crizotinib as part of a clinical trial were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Outcome Variables</title><p>Various demographic and clinical characteristics were described for each patient. The primary end point was OS in the study and control groups.

Markers of progression were therapy change and death. Switch to subsequent treatment was defined as a switch as a result of disease progression or toxicity. Some patient records did not include all the parameters; available data from these patients were used when applicable.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics (mean, median, and proportion) were used to summarize baseline patient characteristics and treatment patterns. OS time was calculated from the date of therapy initiation to the date of death. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with statistical significance of survival differences assessed using a nonparametric log-rank test.

Moreover, our population included predominately women (59%) and never-smokers (74%) or former smokers (11%) and had a greater prevalence of adenocarcinoma histology (95%). Finally, 71% of patients were treated with crizotinib as first-line therapy in the study group, and all patients received first-line chemotherapy in the control group. Sixty-two percent of patients received crizotinib as first-line therapy in the US study, and only 5% of patients were treated with crizotinib in the first-line setting in the French study. No patients with <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>-positive NSCLC received chemotherapy in these trials. Treatment with crizotinib seemed to be well tolerated in our study; only 3% of patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related toxicity.</p><p>We report a median OS of 31.0 months after initiation of crizotinib, which is comparable with the previous estimation of 33.8 months reported by the US retrospective observational study evaluating crizotinib in the first- and second-line settings.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, the median OS time in these two studies was longer than the median OS time of 23.4 months in the retrospective medical record review conducted in the United States and Canada by Davis et al.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Two hundred twelve patients were included in this review, and 65% of patients initiated crizotinib as first-line therapy. A majority of patients were men (69%), were current or former smokers (66.5%), and had not previously received other cancer-directed treatment (52.8%).</p><p>In prior studies in which more than half of the patients received crizotinib as second-line or later therapy, the median survival time ranges from 16.6 to 20.4 months.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the US retrospective observational study, the median OS time was 26.8 months in patients initiating crizotinib as second-line treatment.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the current study, 29% of patients received crizotinib in the second-line setting. No patients initiated crizotinib as third-line or later therapy, and this could increase the median OS to 35 months. All studies showed no statistically significant differences in OS between first and later lines of therapy. Our results support these findings.

Median OS has been significantly improved from 15 to 31 months.</p><p>The question of access to innovative drugs in oncology is extremely important and complicated by financial burden of the medical social problem. In a number of countries, access to drugs is regulated by separate reimbursement rules and restrictive lists. In this regard, there are often issues with fast and full access to drugs already approved by regulatory national authorities, including delay and other gaps. However, the contribution of innovative drug therapy in metastatic NSCLC could be considered as comparable to modern surgical intervention in operable NSCLC. Thus, despite the limited budget of health care systems in developing countries, therapy with <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic> inhibitors should be considered as lifesaving and a priority first-line therapy in metastatic NSCLC. RUSSCO strongly recommends using crizotinib as first-line therapy in patients with <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>-positive metastatic NSCLC in the Russian Federation.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>A Russian study has several important limitations. First, this trial was not randomized and had a prospective-retrospective cohort design. Second, the study and control groups were not well balanced. Finally, our patients composed a heterogeneous population; for example, patients with brain metastases were included.</p><p>The improved OS observed in crizotinib clinical trials in <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic>-positive metastatic NSCLC has been observed in less selective patient populations treated in daily practice. The use of chemotherapy in these patients seems inappropriate now that a more effective treatment is available.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s11"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><bold>Conception and design:</bold> Ilya Tsimafeyeu, Fedor Moiseenko, Sergei Orlov, Elena Filippova, Ahmed Abdelgafur, Irina Titova, Oksana Barkovskaya, Marina Gikalo, Evgeny Imyanitov, Sergei Tjulandin</p><p><bold>Administrative support:</bold> Galina Statsenko, Dmitry Kosov</p><p><bold>Provision of study materials or patients</bold><bold>:</bold> Sergei Orlov, Elena Karabina, Valentina Shikina, Ahmed Abdelgafur, Galina Makarnyaeva, Marina Gikalo, Nikita Savelov, Evgeny Imyanitov</p><p><bold>Collection and assembly of data:</bold> Ilya Tsimafeyeu, Fedor Moiseenko, Sergei Orlov, Elena Filippova, Alexander Belonogov, Amir Khalimov, Elena Karabina, Valentina Shikina, Ahmed Abdelgafur, Galina Statsenko, Galina Makarnyaeva, Oksana Barkovskaya, Marina Gikalo, Nikita Savelov, Dmitry Kosov, Evgeny Imyanitov, Irina Demidova, Aleksey Nebesnykh, Aleksey Mordovskiy, Aleksey Smirnov</p><p><bold>Data analysis and interpretation:</bold> Ilya Tsimafeyeu, Fedor Moiseenko, Sergei Orlov, Elena Filippova, Ahmed Abdelgafur, Dmitry Isaichikov, Oksana Barkovskaya, Marina Gikalo, Dmitry Kosov, Evgeny Imyanitov, Sergei Tjulandin, Aleksey Nebesnykh, Aleksey Mordovskiy, Aleksey Smirnov</p><p><bold>Manuscript writing:</bold> All authors</p><p><bold>Final approval of manuscript:</bold> All authors</p><p><bold>Accountable for all aspects of the work:</bold> All authors</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this manuscript.
