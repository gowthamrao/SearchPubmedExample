</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background and rationale {6a}</title><p id="Par8">In the past two decades, the rate of opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has more than quadrupled, constituting a US public health crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Perinatal OUD presents a unique set of healthcare challenges for affected mothers and their children across a continuum of care. For this population, multiple clinical and psychosocial risk factors contribute to increased rates of pregnancy complications, newborn morbidity, and childhood developmental and health concerns. Although most research on perinatal OUD has focused on pregnancy and birth hospitalization care, fewer studies have focused on pediatric primary care after discharge from the hospital, when ongoing risks associated with OUD may include a myriad of factors including fear of stigma, low health literacy, maladaptive parenting behaviors, and economic and social barriers to seeking healthcare.</p><p id="Par9">Addressing social and emotional determinants of health is a core focus of pediatric primary care clinicians, particularly in the context of well child care (WCC) visits. WCC visits, which occur at age-specific intervals defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics, emphasize anticipatory guidance, psychosocial screening, connection to community resources, and assessments of child growth, health, development, and behavior. There is evidence that WCC could be improved for children impacted by maternal OUD, who often experience multiple clinical and psychosocial concerns in infancy and early childhood such feeding difficulties, hepatitis C exposure, and developmental delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite these concerns, low attendance to WCC for this patient population has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and mothers with OUD have described traditional WCC visits in the pediatric primary care setting as limited in time and resources to comprehensively address their questions and needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lack of time and resources to comprehensively address care needs of mothers with OUD and their children has also been reported by primary care pediatricians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is an urgent need for research to enhance the effectiveness, perceived value, and quality of pediatric primary care for this growing and underserved population.</p><p id="Par10">One promising intervention for mothers in treatment for OUD and their children is group WCC, in which multiple mother&#8211;child dyads receive pediatric care together. Group WCC visits encourage increased breadth and depth of discussion, peer-to-peer support, and greater emphasis on self-care and behavior change. In addition to standard WCC topics focused on child health and development, the group WCC visit format places emphasis on maternal wellness including nutrition and exercise, family planning, stress reduction, and interpersonal relationships. Available research suggests this intervention increases patient-reported satisfaction and adherence to recommended care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, evidence supporting the use of group WCC for mothers with OUD is lacking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives {7}</title><p id="Par11">The overall objective of this trial is to evaluate a group model of WCC for mothers with OUD and their children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design {8}</title><p id="Par12">This is a single-site cluster randomized controlled trial. One hundred eight pregnant and parenting women receiving treatment for OUD from one single opioid treatment program will be enrolled into the study. Twenty-six consecutive clusters&#8212;based on the one-month birth intervals of participants&#8217; infants&#8212;of&#8201;~&#8201;4 dyads will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two study arms. Thirteen clusters will be randomized to individual WCC (control group), and 13 birth clusters will be randomized to group WCC (intervention arm), with concealment of randomization from participants until after they have completed their initial enrollment study visit, or, for those who are pregnant at time of enrollment, immediately following delivery. Randomization by birth month was selected to ensure a close age range among infants receiving group WCC together in the intervention arm. Blocking or stratification was not used in the randomization. Dyads in both study arms will be followed prospectively for 18&#160;months, and data will be compared between the two study arms. Primary outcomes include well child care quality and utilization, child health knowledge, and parenting quality. We hypothesize that at the end of the study period, participants in the intervention arm will have increased WCC engagement, knowledge about parenting, and maternal responsiveness compared to participants in the control arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods: participants, interventions, and outcomes</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting {9}</title><p id="Par13">This trial is conducted within a single, urban substance use disorder (SUD) treatment center affiliated with a university and university health system. The treatment center includes a licensed outpatient opioid treatment program and a residential treatment program, both of which serve pregnant and/or parenting women exclusively. At both outpatient and residential levels of care, all patients receive comprehensive wraparound services, including methadone and buprenorphine as medications for OUD, psychiatric medications and psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based therapy for substance use disorder in individual, family, and group formats, case management, medical care coordination, peer recovery support, mindfulness-based parenting psychoeducation, and various other services especially needed by the population of pregnant and/or parenting women with SUDs. At the residential level of care, women live with their children at the facility and receive the majority of programming at the facility for an average of 6&#160;months. Upon completion of residential treatment, the majority of patients continue their SUD treatment at the outpatient facility. Patients are welcome to participate in the outpatient program for as long as they desire, and the average length of outpatient treatment is 3&#8211;4&#160;years. Across both programs, the treatment center serves approximately 250 women each year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria {3}</title><p id="Par14">Inclusion criteria for screening for and consent into the trial are as follows: (1) 18&#160;years or older, (2) at least 28&#160;weeks pregnant or parenting a child less than 12&#160;months of age, (3) receiving treatment for OUD from the recruitment opioid treatment program, (4) ability to read and speak English, (5) plans to parent infant after delivery (if pregnant), (6) intent to seek pediatric care within the affiliated health system, and (7) intent to remain in the local area for the next 2&#160;years. Exclusion criteria include (1) inability to speak English, (2) plans to move outside of the local area in the next 2&#160;years, (3) plans to not parent infant after delivery, and (4) plans to seek pediatric care outside of the affiliated health system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title><p id="Par15">A 2-page study flyer is posted at the check-in desks of the treatment program&#8217;s outpatient and residential facilities. This flyer explains the study and provides contact information for the research coordinator and principal investigators. Additionally, research personnel review the opioid treatment program&#8217;s pregnancy census list weekly for new pregnant admissions or newly delivered clients. Staff at the opioid treatment program are asked to identify eligible individuals. All identified individuals are contacted by study personnel, either by phone or in-person, informed about the study, and asked if they are willing to participate. If they agree, an enrollment interview is carried out. Study personnel explain the purpose of the study, answer questions, and obtain written informed consent from those who meet study inclusion criteria. Those who consent to participate are provided with a copy of the consent form with contact details of the research team. Eligible individuals who do not agree to participate are asked to self-report basic sociodemographic information (e.g., age, education level, number of kids, and reason for refusal) to allow a comparison of enrolled and non-enrolled individuals. All staff responsible for obtaining consent are trained and certified in the protection of human subjects and study-specific consent procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b}</title><p id="Par16">When obtaining informed consent, participants are informed that their data will be de-identified and stored in a secure database and that any data released will not be identifiable.

Standard individual WCC is the comparator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention description {11a}</title><p id="Par18">As the framework for the group WCC intervention, we leveraged Centering&#174;, a model of care delivery developed by The Centering&#174; Healthcare Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Centering&#174; seeks to shift the paradigm of health services from individual to group care, bringing patients out of a traditional office and into a group setting where they learn from their providers and each other. Each group session has planned core content, with consistency of providers across all sessions, and 2&#160;h per session for health assessment, interactive learning, and community building. Instead of didactic education, providers use facilitative leadership, encouraging patients to fully engage in their care and raise issues of importance to them.</p><p id="Par19"><italic toggle="yes">CenteringParenting</italic>is the pediatric adaptation of Centering&#174; and is based on the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended schedule of visit periodicity, including developmental milestone assessments, anticipatory guidance, and immunizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This consists of an initial 30-min newborn visit usually within 2&#8211;3&#160;days after discharge at the affiliated pediatric primary care office, with any additional 15-min visits in the first few weeks of life as needed, i.e., for jaundice or a weight check. Beginning with the 1-month WCC visit, mother-infant dyads grouped by birth month (anticipated <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8211;5 per group) are scheduled for WCC together, with subsequent visits occurring at the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended intervals (2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18&#160;months of age). Group WCC visits occur on-site at the opioid treatment program. Infants with an extended hospitalization beyond 1&#160;month are eligible to join into a later group session if needed.</p><p id="Par21">Participants who are already parenting a child&#8201;&lt;&#8201;12&#160;months of age at the time of enrollment and are randomized to the intervention arm are grouped with other mother-infant dyads by infant birth month and scheduled for WCC together. Group WCC visits occur on-site at the opioid treatment program. Visits occur at the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended intervals.</p><p id="Par22">Group WCC sessions diverge from individual WCC in the following ways:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic toggle="yes">Setting and duration</italic>: Group WCC sessions occur in a dedicated group room at the SUD treatment program and last 2&#160;h. A room divider with a computer and an examination table offers a private area for pediatricians to examine the infant and review history, current issues, and other maternal concerns. The group space itself entails a circle of chairs or pillows on the floor with mats in the middle for infants. There are shelves with children&#8217;s books and toys that participants may use. Healthy snacks are provided during the session for the mothers and their children (when age appropriate).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24"><italic toggle="yes">Provider interaction</italic>: Each group is assigned to one pediatrician who will lead all WCC sessions for that group, with a nurse practitioner from the opioid treatment program serving as co-facilitator.

A pediatric nurse assists with immunizations and other procedures.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25"><italic toggle="yes">Content</italic>: A structured, reproducible modular curriculum guides session content, with flexibility based on group needs. Facilitated group discussions provide opportunity for skills building, knowledge sharing, and normalization of early parenting experiences.

This practice site includes 14 physicians and nurse practitioners, serves a predominantly Medicaid-insured population, and is a training environment for students and residents. Newborns are scheduled for an initial 30-min visit within 3&#8211;5&#160;days after discharge home, with any additional 15-min visits in the first few weeks of life as needed (i.e., for jaundice or a weight check). Subsequent 15-min WCC visits occur at recommended intervals per American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, and 36&#160;months of age). Routine care in this practice setting includes maternal depression screening, provision of books as part of a national literacy promotion program, developmental screening, and social determinants of health screening. A dedicated RN coordinator tracks receipt of preventative services for all patients and provides outreach to patients who no-show for WCC, and access to subspecialty care, social work, and lactation services are available on-site. Scheduling of visits may occur in-person at the registration desk, through an online patient portal, or by telephone.

Issues such as maternal substance use or relapse, child safety concerns, and indications for child protective service involvement as well as housing, family safety, and other concerns are addressed with the team and clinical therapists, social workers, navigators, or peer support specialists are engaged to address issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}</title><p id="Par75">Regular meetings (weekly/monthly) will be held to monitor the study conduct and address potential problems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g., trial participants, ethical committees) {25}</title><p id="Par76">Changes to the protocol will be communicated to the IRB and approval from the IRB will be obtained prior to implementing any proposed changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Dissemination plans {31a}</title><p id="Par77">Trial results will be disseminated at local and national conferences and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par78">Given the current opioid epidemic and the increase in opioid use and misuse among pregnant women in the USA, this project is timely and highly relevant. The integration of group WCC into maternal OUD treatment represents a &#8220;game-changer&#8221; in disrupting health system silos and addresses the intergenerational effects of maternal OUD by improving parenting and engagement in and experience of preventative care.
