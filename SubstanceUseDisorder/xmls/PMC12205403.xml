To address this coverage gap, the American Rescue Plan of 2021 allowed states to extend postpartum coverage for up to 12 months post partum beginning on April 1, 2022. To date, all states except Arkansas have implemented or plan to implement a full or partial extension.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> While it may be too early to assess the full effects of the 12-month postpartum extension, the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) established a moratorium on disenrollment in Medicaid, effectively extending coverage for pregnant people well beyond the traditional 60-day period. This policy offers a window into the potential effects of extended Medicaid coverage for postpartum individuals.</p><p>Our study provides early evidence on the implications of postpartum coverage extensions by analyzing the experience of birthing parents in North Carolina. We differentiate among 3 time periods: before the public health emergency (pre-PHE) when post-partum coverage was limited to 60 days, during the public health emergency (PHE) when states were required to maintain coverage, and after North Carolina implemented the 12-month postpartum extension (extension). We document how Medicaid postpartum coverage differed across cohorts and then describe Medicaid-financed care utilization during 3 to 12 months post partum among the PHE cohort, including maternity as well as physical and behavioral health care.</p><p>We also examine differences among the 3 cohorts in their use of services in the 60-day postpartum period. We hypothesize that having coverage for a longer time period may affect the timing of care for services such as primary or even behavioral care, although the direction is not clear. For example, people with only 60 days of coverage may actively seek care during this period of low out-of-pocket-costs and extending coverage may decrease the urgency of using services during the 60-day postpartum period. For others, a short coverage window may discourage their use of services during the 60-day period if they felt they could not receive necessary follow-up care (such as for most behavioral health services). For this group, extended coverage may increase the use of services during the 60-day postpartum period. Finally, we compare 60-day service use for the pre-PHE cohort to 12-month service use in the extension cohorts to calculate the extent to which extended coverage is associated with overall Medicaid-financed service use.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-AOI250035"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-AOI250035"><title>Data and Study Sample</title><p>We used North Carolina Medicaid membership, claims, and encounter data from March 2016 through December 2023. Our study sample included Medicaid enrollees aged 14 through 48 years who had a Medicaid-funded birth between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. The University of North Carolina institutional review board approved this study. The requirement for informed consent was waived under 45 CFR 46.116(d). We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-AOI250035"><title>Insurance Coverage</title><p>We identified the Medicaid program that covered the birthing parent&#8217;s delivery hospitalization as the baseline eligibility category. The 12-month postpartum extension primarily affected those with pregnancy-specific Medicaid eligibility (called Medicaid for Pregnant Women [MPW] in North Carolina) and thus we focus most of our analyses on birthing parents eligible for MPW. Other relevant baseline categories included full Medicaid, which does not have time limits on postpartum coverage and emergency Medicaid. In North Carolina, MPW and full Medicaid covered the same set of benefits although they are distinct eligibility categories. Emergency Medicaid covered only obstetric delivery or emergency care and not antepartum or postpartum care. Family planning coverage was an eligibility category examined after delivery; it provides very limited coverage, only covering visits that increase access to reproductive services.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H2-3-AOI250035"><title>Policy Timing and Cohort Definition</title><p>On March 18, 2020, the beginning of the PHE, Congress established a moratorium on disenrollment from Medicaid, effectively extending coverage for pregnant people beyond 60 days. While the PHE ended in May 2023, North Carolina adopted and implemented a 12-month postpartum extension for MPW in April 2022, which conferred guaranteed 12-month coverage for those who gave birth on February 1, 2022, or later.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> While this change occurred during the PHE moratorium, it increased the certainty around postpartum coverage so we consider it a separate policy period. People who gave birth on or after April 1, 2022, were eligible for a guaranteed 12 months of coverage post delivery; in contrast, the length of the postpartum coverage period was uncertain for people who gave birth between March 18, 2020, and March 30, 2022, due to the uncertainty regarding when the PHE would end.</p><p>We identify 3 cohorts of beneficiaries differentiated by their eligibility for postpartum Medicaid coverage at the time of their delivery: (1) pre-PHE, who delivered between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019; (2) PHE, who delivered between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022, prior to the postpartum extension; and (3) extension, who delivered between April 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022. The second and third groups effectively had at least 12 months of coverage, but only the third group had certainty on the length of coverage. Although the PHE did not start until March 2020, coverage was retained for people who gave birth starting in January 2020, since their 60 days of coverage ended after the start of the PHE.</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-AOI250035"><title>Birth Identification</title><p>We identified births in Medicaid claims databased on <italic toggle="yes">International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)</italic> diagnosis codes, <italic toggle="yes">Current Procedural Terminology</italic> codes, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes indicating labor and delivery (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-AOI250035-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). We coded the delivery date as the date on the professional claim (with a delivery code) during an inpatient stay. To identify distinct deliveries, we included deliveries that were more than 300 days apart. Pregnancy episodes included 280 days before to 12 months after obstetric delivery.</p></sec><sec id="H2-5-AOI250035"><title>Utilization Measures</title><p>Utilization outcomes included indicators of (1) the receipt of at least 1 postpartum visit; (2) any contraceptive visit; (3) any primary care visit; (4) any outpatient mental health care; and (5) any outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) care (eTables 1 and 2 in <xref rid="note-AOI250035-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="H2-6-AOI250035"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We first examined insurance coverage for those covered by Medicaid at time of delivery and at 2, 4, and 12 months post partum, both overall and by type of coverage at the time of delivery. We then characterized utilization during the first 2 months, 3 to 6 months and 7 to 12 months post partum among those who had MPW for delivery in the PHE cohort, stratifying the behavioral health outcomes by receipt of corresponding behavioral health services prior to delivery.</p><p>We also compared utilization in the first 60 days post partum among the PHE and extension cohorts compared with the pre-PHE cohort. To control for differences in the composition of the cohorts by utilization and to account for nonindependence in the presence of multiple births, we estimate generalized estimating equation models with a logit link of receipt of the outcomes during the first 2 months of coverage controlling for covariates. The key model covariates were the indicators for beneficiaries in the 2 extended cohorts, with the pre-PHE cohort as the referent category. We note that these indicators will pick up differences in the outcomes for each cohort due both to differences in policies among the cohorts (eg, extended coverage, COVID-19 mitigation policies such as mask wearing or telehealth) as well as changes in the composition of the cohorts not otherwise controlled for by included covariates (eg, potentially greater job loss during the PHE might have newly qualified some birthing parents for MPW coverage). We also included delivery month fixed effects to control for seasonal trends; an indicator of whether any part of the postpartum period occurred during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders (March-May 2020); an indicator for beneficiaries who transitioned to managed care during their postpartum period; and birthing parent characteristics including age at delivery, rural, race and ethnicity, insurance less than 1 month in the prenatal period, and prenatal diagnoses of mental health or SUD. Race and ethnicity were reported in Medicaid databased on enrollment files. Race and ethnicity are included as demographic characteristics and were studied given data on racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and outcomes. We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding births during the stay-at-home orders (March-May 2020).</p><p>Finally, we compared overall utilization rates between the pre-PHE cohort with 2 months of coverage to utilization by the PHE and Extension cohorts with 12 months of coverage to estimate the additional Medicaid-financed service utilization that occurred during both types of extended coverage. Statistical significance was set at 2-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.05.

Pre-PHE, 7 of 10 lacked comprehensive Medicaid coverage by 4 months post partum; during the extension period, 97% of birthing parents kept comprehensive Medicaid through 12 months after delivery. Increased insurance continuity is important and has also been associated with reduction in overall and racial disparities in maternal mortality.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These results may be useful for policymakers, administrators, and clinicians to meet service demands.</p><p>The results are consistent with studies of the effects of the Affordable Care Act on Medicaid coverage among birth people as well as evidence from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) during the PHE.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, PRAMS data did not demonstrate evidence of improved outcomes such as contraceptive use, breastfeeding, or depression symptoms.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Our study documents that Medicaid beneficiaries with extended coverage frequently accessed Medicaid-financed care in the 3 to 12 postpartum months, including postpartum follow up, contraception, PCP visits, and behavioral health services, with some beneficiaries using important postpartum services after 60 days.</p><p>We found some evidence of care delays when people had access to coverage for a longer time period. Expanded postpartum coverage was associated with decreased postpartum visits and contraceptive visits in the first 60 days post partum for the PHE and Extension cohorts relative to pre-PHE cohort (<xref rid="aoi250035t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, overall utilization of postpartum visits over 12 months for both post-PHE cohorts was similar to 60-day utilization for the pre-PHE cohort (<xref rid="aoi250035t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We do note a modest correlation with lower rates of postpartum visits within 12 months among the extension cohort at a time when access to care should have been increasing due to the end of the pandemic and greater certainty about insurance coverage. One hypothesis is that we may be observing a trade-off between visit and clinician types during the extension if patients are seeing primary care practitioners who do not code the service as a postpartum screening visit (<xref rid="aoi250035t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Patients may also have had difficulty obtaining care even though they had coverage.</p><p>While initiation of contraception is recommended prior to resumption of intercourse to promote healthy birth spacing and reproductive autonomy,<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> many birthing parents may not start contraception in this timeframe or may change contraceptive type. We find evidence of substantive Medicaid-financed contraceptive use during the extended postpartum coverage period. Sixteen percent of beneficiaries had their first contraceptive visit outside the 60-day timeframe and 31% had 1 or more follow up visits, which can be an opportunity to switch contraceptive types to a modality more appropriate with their longer term health status.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>We find extended coverage was associated with more mental health service use during the 60-day postpartum period, particularly among those who were previously diagnosed, and also more use of Medicaid-financed mental health services after 60 days. These findings warrant further examination as it could be associated with the policy change or with observed postpandemic population-level increases in mental health diagnoses.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> These results suggest that extended postpartum coverage could help address important postpartum mental health challenges. Suicide and behavioral health conditions accounted for one-third of North Carolina&#8217;s pregnancy-related deaths in 2018-2019, making them the most prevalent cause of death, as is true nationally.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Treatment of substance use disorder deserves particular attention given state and national increasing trends in pregnancy-associated death from drug overdose.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-10-AOI250035"><title>Limitations</title><p>A key study limitation is the lack of information on services not financed by Medicaid, including possible undercounting of prenatal care visits or post-pregnancy care.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Increases in Medicaid-financed services may not necessarily translate to increases in the use of any service, particularly if people would have transitioned to commercial insurance after 60 days. Evidence using PRAMS data, however, suggests that around 20% of individuals with Medicaid-financed births obtain commercial insurance post partum, which slightly declined following implementation of extended coverage, suggesting that health care use covered by alternative coverage sources may have been minimal.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="aoi250035r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Additionally, it is possible in this descriptive study that observed changes in utilization may be due to factors unrelated to insurance coverage, such as changes in availability of care during the PHE. It is also important to consider the North Carolina context when interpreting the findings. North Carolina expanded Medicaid coverage in December 2023, after our study period. In addition, MPW coverage in North Carolina confers full Medicaid benefits, unlike other states that may restrict covered benefits to pregnancy-related care.<sup><xref rid="aoi250035r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The study period includes the July 2021 implementation of Medicaid Managed Care in NC. While this may have disrupted or consolidated care networks, our analysis controls for managed care implementation. Finally, both coverage and utilization are intermediate outcomes; future research should more directly assess beneficiary health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI250035"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we observed substantial utilization of Medicaid-financed care among birthing parents in North Carolina following the implementation of extended Medicaid postpartum coverage.
