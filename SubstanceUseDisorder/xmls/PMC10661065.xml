Methadone, an OUD treatment, has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of overdose and improving overall health and quality of life.

The secondary outcome was Medicaid prescriptions for methadone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Methadone distribution for OUD has expanded significantly over the past decade, with an average state increase of +96.96% from 2010 to 2020. There was a significant increase in overall distribution of methadone to OTP from 2010 to 2020 (+61.00%, p&lt;0.001) and from 2015 to 2020 (+26.22%, p&lt;0.001). However, the distribution to OTPs did not significantly change from 2019 to 2021 (&#8722;5.15%, p=0.491). There was considerable state-level variation in methadone prescribing to Medicaid patients with four states having no prescriptions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There have been dynamic changes in methadone distribution for OUD. Furthermore, pronounced variation in methadone distribution among states was observed, with some states having no OTPs or Medicaid coverage.

</p></supplementary-material><p>Methadone is a safe and effective treatment for OUD in fentanyl users and is the preferred medication over buprenorphine in this population. Methadone treatment is associated with a significant decrease in illicit drug use, including fentanyl. Patients with OUD who are using fentanyl are at increased risk of overdose and relapse, but methadone treatment can significantly reduce this risk. Additionally, patients who test positive for fentanyl use at the start of methadone treatment are just as likely to achieve remission as patients who test negative for fentanyl use. Methadone may also be protective against fentanyl overdose deaths.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These findings suggest that methadone is a valuable tool for treating OUD in fentanyl users.</p><p>There have been over 1 million drug overdoses in the USA since the start of the opioid epidemic.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous stress on the healthcare system including the access to providers and availability of OUD treatments. Between 2019 and 2020, there was a +48.8% increase in overdose mortality among Black people, compared with +26.3% among white people.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Moreover, from April 2020 to April 2021, the number of drug overdoses in the USA exceeded 100 000, a +28.5% increase over the previous year.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> With a +60%&#8201;rise in overdoses compared with the previous year, May 2020 became the deadliest month on record.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>A cross-sectional study, conducted from May to June 2020 in the USA and Canada, found that new patients wishing to initiate methadone treatment were faced with a barrier in 20% of clinics.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Similarly, prior to the pandemic, both methadone and buprenorphine-based OTPs were found to be effective in US jails and prisons. However, following the pandemic, some of these OTPs have been expanded while others were discontinued.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#8211;33</xref></p><p>This study obtained data from the Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s (DEA) Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS), a federal programme established by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, to monitor the distribution of DEA-controlled substances from various sources including retail pharmacies, hospitals, practitioners, teaching institutions, mid-level practitioners and OTPs.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Previous pharmacoepidemiological studies have also used the ARCOS Database.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#8211;39</xref> It is important to note that ARCOS does not provide information on the number of patients receiving methadone. This caveat is important because it prevents an accurate representation of the amount of methadone used for each OUD patient. However, federally funded OTPs record number of patients receiving treatment, which could be a useful resource in understanding the true scale of the OUD epidemic in the USA and the effectiveness of treatment efforts. The Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration&#8217;s (SAMHSA) National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services&#8217; (N-SSATS) annual report provides national data regarding alcohol and drug abuse facilities.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The number of patients receiving methadone for OUD decreased by almost one-quarter (&#8722;23.7%) from 2019 (408 550) to 2020 (311 531)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ARCOS, Medicaid&#8217;s State Drug Utilization Data (SDUD) Database was used in this study.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Medicaid is a programme at the federal and state level which functions to aid in covering healthcare costs for patients with limited resources.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Medicaid.gov publishes all prescription drugs covered by Medicaid every year for all 50 states and the District of Colombia (DC) in the SDUD Database. The State Health Official Letter, released on 30 December 2020, states that the SUPPORT Act of 2018 mandates the inclusion of Medicaid coverage for MOUD for all eligible patients with OUD. Subsequently, the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2021, which added to the SUPPORT Act, requires rebates on methadone and other MOUD starting from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2025.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> However, not all states have equal coverage of medications, which can lead to discrepancies in the prescription numbers reflected by the SDUD. There is variation among states regarding methadone coverage, which in turn affects prescribing methadone patterns.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>This manuscript aims to address the paucity of research on methadone for OUD treatment over the past decade and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19-related policies on individuals with OUD is poorly understood, and this manuscript seeks to shed light on this important area of research. The use of both ARCOS and SDUD Databases provides a comprehensive picture of the distribution and utilisation of methadone for the OUD treatment over the past decade. Together, it is critical to examine the changes in methadone distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine whether there are national or regional barriers to accessing this evidence-based pharmacotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The quantities of methadone distributed (in grams) per state were obtained from the ARCOS yearly drug summary reports for the years 2010, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Results of the one-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of time on milligrams of methadone per person per state (F(4, 200)=24.535, p&lt;0.001). Specifically, the average per cent change in state distribution of methadone for OUD from 2010 to 2020 significantly increased by +96.96% (SD=146.64%, Sidak post hoc p&lt;0.001), with 43 states showing an increase, 5 states a decrease (DC, Florida, Maine, Tennessee and West Virginia) and 3 states showing no change (North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming).

Slightly over half (28) of states showed an increase and 22 states exhibited a decrease. No significant (p=1.000) differences were found between 2019 and 2020. Examination of specific states revealed an increase in Kentucky (+18.68%) and a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in Ohio (+26.02%) relative to the national mean. In contrast, there were appreciable decreases in Nebraska (&#8722;16.6%), South Dakota (&#8722;17.27%) and Mississippi (&#8722;20.53%), and significant decreases (p&lt;0.05) in Alabama (&#8722;21.96%), New Hampshire (&#8722;24.13%) and Florida (&#8722;28.97%) relative to the national mean (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).

Eighteen states showed an increase, while 31 states showed a decrease. Ohio (+47.53%) had a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) relative to the national mean.

In summary, methadone distribution declined from 2019 to 2021, with significant decreases in four states and an increase in one state.</p><p>The average methadone distribution in the USA for OUD was 43.75&#8201;mg/person (SD=35.01) in 2021. There was significantly elevated methadone distributed in Rhode Island (155.13&#8201;mg/person), Delaware (147.27&#8201;mg/person), Connecticut (126.66&#8201;mg/person) and Vermont (125.06&#8201;mg/person) relative to the national mean (43.75, p&lt;0.05). Therefore, the distribution was relatively uniform in 2021, with significant elevations in Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut and Vermont.</p><p>The total number of OTPs distributing methadone in the USA increased +18.6% from 2010 (1139) to 2015 (1351) and peaked in 2021 (1738, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 2B</xref>). In comparison, the number of pharmacies distributing buprenorphine (49 041) was 43.1-fold greater than OTPs distributing methadone in 2010. However, this ratio decreased to 33.3-fold in 2021. Results of the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between time and OTPs per 1 million persons per state (F(3, 150)=38.067, p&lt;0.000). The number of OTPs per 1 million persons per state significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001) from 2010 to 2021. In addition, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Sidak post hoc revealed 2010&#8211;2015 (p&lt;0.0001), 2010&#8211;2020 (p&lt;0.0001), 2015&#8211;2020 (p&lt;0.0001) and 2015&#8211;2021 (p&lt;0.0001) were each significantly different. The number of OTPs per 1&#8201;million persons per state in 2020 relative to 2021 did not significantly increase (p=0.683). Twenty states had fewer OTPs in 2021 relative to 2010, 2015 or 2020 (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Washington). One state (Wyoming) did not have a single OTP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 3</xref>). To sum up, the number of OTPs distributing methadone increased significantly from 2010 to 2021 but plateaued in 2021. The number of OTPs per million persons per state also increased significantly, but there was no significant increase from 2020 to 2021.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Medicaid</title><p>The SDUD Database showed considerable variation in methadone prescribing between states and regions for patients covered under Medicaid (mean=475.39, SD=1097.78 with four states having values of 0).

Nonetheless, the rate of methadone overdose deaths remained low with no significant increase in this report, suggesting no change in non-prescribed methadone use during the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Conversely, others have reached the opposite conclusion.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Since OTPs were not distributing additional methadone Morphine Mg Equivalents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and overdose rates continue to surge, this emphasises the need for expanded access to methadone treatment and reduced treatment barriers. Individuals who overdose on illicit and prescription opioids including heroin and fentanyl may be prime candidates for methadone treatment. Additional solutions can include allowing for earlier access to take-home methadone from OTPs and allowing for patients to obtain methadone prescriptions from community pharmacies after a period of OUD stability, which is currently prohibited by law outside of an OTP.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Another uncommonly employed solution is to provide travelling methadone treatment on a daily route which can allow observed administration and decreased need for transportation to a further location.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> This would be particularly beneficial not only for rural areas but also useful for zip codes with a limited number of methadone programmes.</p><p>Despite methadone being an effective evidence-based treatment for OUD,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> only 41 states in 2018 had methadone covered under Medicaid.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Twelve states located predominantly in the South and Midwest opted to not expand Medicaid, leaving patients in these areas vulnerable to inaccessible treatment.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> States where methadone was not covered included: Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> It was also found that only four states with 5.40% of the US population accounted for the preponderance (64.03%) of prescriptions. Although this lab has prior experience with Medicaid in various capacities (clozapine, esketamine, etc), the data acquired should be viewed with substantial scepticism unless subsequently verified by others, as some states may not have uploaded all their methadone data.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> This pronounced disparity indicates that patients in certain states and regions have appreciably better access to this evidence-based treatment for OUD than others.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>This study suggests the importance of policy change as there is a pressing need for additional access to OUD therapy, specifically methadone treatment, in the USA. Over 400&#8201;000 people in the USA received methadone from an OTP pre-pandemic, 2019, with over 90% located in urban areas, making it challenging for rural patients to receive their medication.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56&#8211;59</xref> SAMHSA released guidelines in March 2020 allowing the regulatory authorities of all states to request blanket exceptions to allow OTP patients to take home doses of methadone and buprenorphine.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> These guidelines were extended in November 2021. However, the number of patients receiving methadone declined in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic by one-quarter.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Many providers and public health researchers are calling for these take-home dosage rules to be continued post-pandemic,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 62</xref> although others that evaluated the number of overdoses involving methadone are more cautious.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 63</xref></p><p>The number of pharmacies which dispensed buprenorphine was 34-fold greater in 2021 than the number of OTPs that dispensed methadone, indicating that buprenorphine is more easily accessible and available than methadone. On the other hand, the volume of methadone distributed by weight from OTPs was 2.4-fold higher than buprenorphine from pharmacies, hospitals and OTPs combined (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>). It is currently curious that there are more restrictions in the USA for prescribing methadone than for other Schedule II substances like fentanyl or oxycodone. Overcoming the &#8216;Not in my Backyard&#8217; stigma surrounding OTPs is not a trivial undertaking and is exacerbated by a common lack of understanding of OUD as a chronic disease.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> It will require a paradigm shift to allow supervised administration in pharmacies, primary care offices, mobile units as are common in other western nations and even video-observed therapy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 30 64 65</xref></p><p>Expanding the role of specialty trained pharmacists by expanding the MOUD regulations to allow provider-delegated induction with buprenorphine in pharmacies can immediately increase access to MOUD.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64&#8211;68</xref> According to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023, which was passed on 29 December 2022, medical providers with a current DEA registration number are now able to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD without needing an X-DEA waiver if state law permits it.<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> Overall, this is important because it aims to remove existing barriers to OUD treatment and increase access to care for individuals who need it.</p><p>During the pandemic, daily visits to a methadone clinic were a health hazard and regulations governing the clinical work of methadone clinics were changed. Nonetheless, methadone remains more challenging for patients to access on many counts. Additionally, the regulatory burden surrounding methadone maintenance means that creating clinics requires substantially more time, money and effort than even specialty addiction medicine clinics where buprenorphine can be prescribed. This means that there will always be fewer methadone clinics than buprenorphine prescribers. This difference between the two medications may account for some of the change in methadone use described in this article. With the removal of the X-DEA waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescription, and the expansion of the exception to the Ryan Haight law<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> which governs prescribing scheduled drugs over telemedicine, it is reasonable to expect that an increasing proportion of people who have OUD will receive buprenorphine rather than methadone. Despite lack of robust head-to-head trials,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> methadone has long been considered to have utility when other MOUDs have been ineffective and is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate initiation or ongoing treatment with buprenorphine. Thus, there remains a strong need for wide and equitable methadone availability during this ever-worsening opioid crisis.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></p><p>The non-homogeneous distribution within states should also be a concern for policymakers. The paucity of methadone OTPs across rural states like Wyoming (253&#8201;000 km<sup>2</sup>), South Dakota (200 000 km<sup>2</sup>) and Nebraska (200 ooo km<sup>2</sup>) is an important finding. However, prior research found that another rural state, Maine, which ranked 10th in the USA, had three OTPs in a single 30 000-person city (Bangor) and none in other areas in northern Maine.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Providing funding opportunities to train addiction medicine fellows who will focus on rural care postgraduation can result in a pipeline of addiction medicine leaders to many areas of the USA which are most in need.</p><p>The strengths of this report include novel and timely data from ARCOS which is comprehensive for both distribution and number of distributors. This investigation extends upon earlier research both pre-COVID-19<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and post-COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> Potential caveats and limitations stem from the fact that methadone distribution is reported in ARCOS by weight rather than prescriptions per individual at an OTP. It is notable that ARCOS reporting does not differentiate between pharmacological formulations. Further, this pharmacoepidemiological report does not contain detailed patient-level information including medical comorbidities or social determinants of health. These contributions should be further explored in future investigations with electronic medical records. Because SAMHSA&#8217;s N-SSATS annual reports contain data on the total number of patients receiving methadone at OTPs, they could complement the ARCOS data and allow for a more detailed analysis of opioid-prescribing patterns and patient outcomes (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Importantly, other pharmacoepidemiological research that compared another Schedule II substance from ARCOS with a state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program identified a high correspondence (r=+0.985).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The inclusion of Medicaid data also, at least partially, offsets this concern. However, the substantial state-level inhomogeneity of methadone as reported by Medicaid should be viewed carefully and warrants further study. A reported value of zero for four states could possibly be explained by factors such as states not reporting data or changes in how states report these data over time. Future research should also be focused on determining which patient subgroups were most impacted by the reversal in methadone distribution. As the number of pharmacies nationally distributing buprenorphine decreased (&#8722;4.7%) from 2019 to 2021, further research should evaluate if both methadone and buprenorphine continue to be underused in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>). This research is essential to guide policy and practice efforts to ensure that all individuals with OUD have access to effective MOUD treatment options.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study highlights the trend over the past decade of methadone distribution for OUD in the USA and disparities in access to OTPs in rural and western states. The findings of this study have the potential to guide improvements in OUD treatment policies at the state level, by providing valuable information on disparities in access to OTPs that could lead to the implementation of more permanent solutions. The many policy accommodations to COVID-19 may present an important opportunity to determine which factors most impact the accessibility, adherence, safety and efficacy of methadone. Policy solutions that increase access to MOUD are urgently needed to continue to address the ongoing opioid epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e195" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2023-074845.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e196" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
