We identified a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with HNC (N = 25,572), with &#8805; 1 patient-reported pain event.

After adjusting for covariates, smoking was associated with a 25% increased odds of reporting pain incidents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.52). There was no statistically significant difference in odds of pain reporting between White versus non-White patients (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.30).

This database consists of both source data through integration with clinic electronic health records, as well as electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO), triage, and care management data from <italic toggle="yes">Navigating Cancer's</italic> digital health solution. Electronic health record data include demographic variables (date of birth, race, sex, smoking history, etc) and clinical data elements (diagnosis code, date of diagnosis, cancer stage, and information on systemic therapy). Patient-level data are obtained from structured sources, and all ePRO data within <italic toggle="yes">Navigating Care's</italic> digital health solution are collected in a user-friendly, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&#8211;compliant manner for applicable patient subjects that use the system, and institutional review board approval for the study was received from Duke University.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Navigating Cancer's</italic> ePRO tool, Health Tracker, allows patients with cancer on active treatment to report 14 common cancer-related symptoms via email or text with the ability for patients to add additional toxicities in a free-form text box. These are (1) general pain, (2) constipation, (3) cough, (4) diarrhea, (5) fatigue, (6) fever, (7) mouth or throat sores, (8) nausea, (9) numbness or tingling, (10) rash, (11) shortness of breath, (12) swelling, (13) urinary problems, and (14) vomiting. Each of the terms included in this modified patient reported outcomes version of the common terminology criteria for adverse events (PRO-CTCAE) item library is assessed relative to one or more distinct attributes, including presence or absence, severity, frequency, and/or interference with usual or daily activities. All responses are provided on a four-point Likert scale. The modified language for the PRO-CTCAE recall period is in the past week. Moderate-severe symptoms trigger a real-time notification to nursing staff to address the symptom issue, and associated information is captured in the care management data set as described below.</p><p>In addition to the ePRO data, data on symptom issues are collected via phone-in nurse triage for patients in a reactive manner. Structured fields in the care management platform are also based on the modified PRO-CTCAE instrument, as described above, to enable nurses to capture this information in a consistent manner for all patients. All associated intervention and resolution data for each symptom issue, whether reported through the ePRO tool or via phone-in triage, is captured in structured fields within <italic toggle="yes">Navigating Cancer's</italic> care management system and stored within the Navigating Cancer database.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Our cohort of patients with HNC was based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), between January 2017 and October 2021. Anatomic subsites included were broadly grouped as oropharynx or nonoropharynx or unknown (Data Supplement, online only). We characterized demographic (age, sex, race, marital status, smoking history) and clinical factors (cancer site) associated with any reported pain, and pain resolution by a new prescription for pain management, on the basis of race (White <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> non-White patients) and other characteristics.

Inactive patients with HNC, defined as any patient who had &gt; 180 days between last known treatment date and first symptom report or &gt; 365 days between date of diagnosis and first symptom report, were excluded from the study. Patients with HNC with missing or unknown race values were also excluded in the analysis specific to race, resulting in our final analytical sample size of n = 857 for patients with reported pain, and n = 1,474 for patients without any pain report (Appendix Fig A<xref rid="figA1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, online only).</p></sec><sec><title>Incident Resolution Time Calculation</title><p>Each patient-reported incident includes comprehensive log activity, with associated creation, update, and resolve datetimes.

Pain reporting mechanisms are subjective and often lack standardization; this is especially true in the management of HNC, in which pain is a significant part of symptom burden and opioid use is a mainstay for pain management.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Given that these patients are vulnerable to the stressors associated with both the disease and its management, it is especially important to examine prevalent characteristics in the group of patients with HNC who report pain, as well as pain management for these patients. We found that while there was no significant difference between the number of pain incidents reported by White patients with HNC and non-White patients with HNC, White patients were significantly more likely to receive new pain medications; reported time to pain resolution was also longer for White patients than for non-White patients. Additionally, we found that patients with HNC with a history of smoking were more likely to report pain than were patients without a history of smoking. These findings are significant and might inform guidelines for the provision of high-quality, equitable care for patients with cancer.</p><p>White patients were significantly more likely to receive a new prescription for management of HNC pain than were non-White patients with HNC in this study cohort, despite there being no significant difference in pain reporting between these two groups. Evidence from the literature suggests that pain management has historically differed for patients in different racial groups, without concomitant scientific support for differences in pain perception or pain management preferences on the basis of race or ethnicity.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Given that these patients did not report significantly different amounts of pain by race, it is important to investigate whether the factors driving this variation are patient versus physician-driven or whether they are mostly system-level factors.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Since pain management is a complex subject especially among patients with cancer, the drivers of the racial disparities in pain prescriptions seen in the current study could be similarly convoluted.<sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Previous studies have suggested that patients' pain perception might differ on the basis of sociodemographic characteristics, as well as differences in patient-physician communication, decision making, health literacy, and other social determinants of health.<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Physicians demonstrate high variability in cancer pain management decision making,<sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and patients vary in their opioid preferences.<sup><xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Given the several potential contributors to the variations in pain management observed in the present cohort of patients with HNC, further exploration of disparities in pain management preferences and prescriptions is warranted.</p><p>In addition to White patients with HNC being more likely to receive pain prescriptions, the current study also found that White patients reported a significantly longer time to pain resolution than did non-White patients. Given that our data set does not include information on physician attitudes and practices, and due to the subjectivity of pain reporting and how a patient might assess adequate relief, this finding can be interpreted in different ways. This result might be reflective of physician effort; however, these data alone cannot substantiate the thought that physicians may spend more time focused on pain resolution for White patients. Another explanation for the disparity in time to pain resolution is differential perceived pain intensities among patients; however, previous studies have suggested that pain intensity and prescription preferences do not completely explain the differences in pain management outcomes seen in patients with chronic pain problems, including those of patients with cancer.<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The current study design does not assess causality, nor does it evaluate pain on an objective scale; further investigation is warranted to elucidate the patient-physician factors that drive time to pain resolution.</p><p>One hypothesis that might explain the variations in pain resolution time observed in this study is differential pain resolution expectation among patients. Evidence suggests that racial minorities are significantly more likely to expect their pain to be inadequately resolved, have lower perceived control over their pain problems, or use other external, nonprescription methods for coping, such as turning to faith and spirituality.<sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> It should also be noted that age younger than 65 years was significantly associated with a decreased odds of reporting pain; however, there were no significant differences in how this pain was managed when compared with individuals older than 65 years. These differences in pain reporting and management were associated with race and not age; it is possible that, though several components might contribute to whether a patient reports pain, could be an important factor in how reported pain is managed. Future research should test the above hypothesis with respect to survivors' pain resolution expectations.</p><p>Patients with HNC with a history of smoking were more likely to report pain incidents. Smoking is an important cause of HNC; about 80% of patients with HNC have a history of tobacco use, and many continue to smoke after diagnosis and during treatment.<sup><xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Previous HNC studies indicate associations between pain reporting, opioid use, and smoking.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Patients with HNC and other patients with cancer may use smoking as a mechanism to cope with their chronic pain, with or without opioid.<sup><xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Also, patients with HNC who are current smokers are more likely to report general and oral pain than former smokers or never-smokers<sup><xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>; this is unsurprising, given that smoking is abrasive to the oral mucosa and is linked to general pain.<sup><xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Further, race might contribute to the variations in pain prescription rates in smoking and nonsmoking patients. Several studies have established that differences in smoking behaviors are not independent of race and ethnicity<sup><xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>; White patients have been shown to smoke for shorter periods of time and find more success in smoking cessation compared with other minority groups.<sup><xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> This association between smoking and opioid use and/or pain reporting might be important clinically in tracking patients at risk for opioid dependence, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>In cancer treatment, adequate pain control is considered a benchmark for high-quality, equitable care, and opioid use among cancer survivors is almost double that of the national population.<sup><xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Pain is one of the most feared symptoms for patients with HNC, and HNC has some of the highest reported pain prevalence of all cancer sites. As the need for pain management is inevitable in HNC care, the findings from this study expose an issue of pain control equity; this mirrors the equity issues present in wider society both for chronic, noncancer pain and for cancer pain, with non-White patients being less likely to receive pain prescriptions despite their similar rates of reported pain. This is undoubtedly a complex problem that merits examination of the multilevel drivers of disparity in management of pain in oncology.</p><p>This study was not without limitations. The <italic toggle="yes">Navigating Cancer</italic> data used for the current study did not include some relevant information such as treatment modality, tumor p16 status, and staging information. Further, the cross-sectional design meant that no causality could be ascertained. In addition, the variability of reporting of pain and pain resolution opens these results to wider interpretation; pain is a subjective experience, so, by definition, there exists no categorical scale that patients might use to classify their experiences. Another important limitation of the current study is that we grouped race as White versus non-White. Our data set had mostly White patients, and analysis specifying minority racial/ethnic groups, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, was impractical. We acknowledge that while our White versus non-White grouping has given some insight into racial disparity in pain prescription in HNC, the lack of granularity in our grouping masks whatever differences in pain prescription patterns might exist among individuals from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds. Future studies with more representative data are needed to validate our results among individuals from minority racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, some of the patients in our cohort may have reported other symptoms concurrently with pain, which could influence our estimated pain prevalence. Another limitation was our inability to further examine the impact of time since diagnosis with HNC and pain management, as the amount of time living with HNC is likely to influence patients' pain experience. This will be the subject of a future study with a larger sample size and a robust design that allows observation of patients with HNC from several months before HNC diagnosis and would include information on staging and treatment.</p><p>Notwithstanding these limitations, the present study is the first, to our knowledge, to describe pain reporting and treatment triage among patients with HNC in the community oncology setting. Further examination of this cohort could yield important insights in cancer survivorship and quality of care for HNC survivors.</p><p>In conclusion, in a cohort of patients with HNC in a community oncology setting, at least one in three patients reported a pain incident. While patients may not differ in number of pain incidents reported, White patients with HNC are significantly more likely to receive new pain prescriptions than non-White patients and report longer amounts of time to pain resolution. In addition, patients with HNC with a smoking history were more likely to report pain. As pain management is a mainstay of HNC care, it is important to address the disparities associated with pain management in HNC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="presented-at"><title>PRIOR PRESENTATION</title><fn specific-use="presented-at" fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented in part as a poster in the 2021 ASCO Quality Care Symposium, Boston, MA, September 24-25, 2021.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="contributed"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p><bold>Conception and design:</bold> Arun Bhardwaj, Amila Patel, Blaine D.
