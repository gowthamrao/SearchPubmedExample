Among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), an estimated 20% eventually die of drug overdose [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases also contribute to mortality rates. Patients with OUD who are hospitalized for OUD-related and other diagnoses are often medically complex and face life-threatening illnesses. These patients experience higher mortality rates than hospitalized patients with similar conditions [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Hospitalization is a vulnerable time for patients with OUD. People with OUD may leave the hospital before completing recommended medical therapy if withdrawal symptoms are untreated [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. People who withdraw from opioids have lower drug tolerance and increased risk of drug overdose after discharge in the absence of treatment for OUD [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, can reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose in patients with OUD [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These medications work as opioid receptor full agonists (methadone), partial agonists (buprenorphine), or antagonists (naltrexone) [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the success of MOUD to reduce opioid overdose deaths, most hospitalized patients with OUD are not started on MOUD [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0256793.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], though, when offered, nearly three-quarters of patients with OUD choose to start MOUD [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interventions to improve initiation of MOUD among hospitalized patients are urgently needed [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Addiction consult services (ACS) are an emerging intervention to engage hospitalized patients in care and meet patient-driven goals for substance use treatment [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Typically, they include care from an interprofessional team that may include medical providers, social workers, nurses, and alcohol and drug counselors [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some intentionally include people with lived experience in recovery [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ACSs typically address the needs of people who use any substance (for example, stimulant, alcohol, and opioids). Care includes comprehensive assessments, withdrawal management, medication treatment, psychosocial and harm reduction interventions, and efforts to support patient engagement and linkage to care across settings. ACSs commonly also provide staff education and patient advocacy [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0256793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0256793.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Evaluation of ACS demonstrates improved engagement in post-hospitalization treatment and decreased substance use [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0256793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, assessing the effect of ACS using gold-standard study designs is challenging because of the costs and logistical challenges associated with multi-site, cluster-randomized trials. Additionally, it can be difficult statistically to assess distal, rare outcomes like drug-related mortality in the context of a hospital-based intervention. We consequently do not know how ACSs affect post-discharge drug-related mortality or non-drug related mortality for patients with OUD.</p><p>Simulation modeling allows researchers to rapidly test different care delivery scenarios and capture robust estimates of study outcomes, which can support healthcare system decision-making and answer salient clinical questions in the midst of the opioid overdose epidemic. Modeling inpatient care scenarios can guide healthcare systems in addressing a rapidly evolving epidemic more quickly and adaptively than randomized trials.

IMPACT is a hospital-based service that utilizes an interdisciplinary team of physicians, advanced practice providers, social workers, and peers with lived experience in recovery to support non-treatment seeking adults with substance use disorder. Patients are eligible to be referred if they have known or suspected substance use disorder (SUD), other than tobacco use disorder alone. IMPACT conducts substance use assessments, initiates medication-based treatment (including buprenorphine, methadone and extended release naltrexone for OUD) and behavioral treatment where appropriate, and connects patients to post-discharge SUD treatment. IMPACT utilizes a harm reduction approach and integrates principles of trauma-informed care.

Recent research has shown that evidence-based MOUD has superior outcomes in preventing mortality and decreasing opioid use [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For this reason, we defined post-discharge OUD treatment engagement as: 1) at least two filled prescriptions for buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, or methadone from an Opioid Treatment Program in the 30 days following hospital discharge, or 2) a prescription for extended-release naltrexone or buprenorphine that covered 28 of the 30 days post-hospital discharge [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>12-month mortality</title><p>At twelve months, deaths are classified as drug related versus non-drug related (including as circulatory, neoplasm, infectious, digestive (including alcohol-related liver disease), external (including suicide and unintentional injury), respiratory, endocrine, and other) by ICD-10 mortality codes described by Hser et al.

We needed a dataset of patients, where some patients were referred to ACS and some were not. Then, we needed to be able to match ACS patients to controls as one way to account for some confounding. We needed the dataset to follow both patients referred to ACS, and those not, through 12 months after hospital discharge. Finally, we needed the dataset to have additional covariates to control for additional confounding, which we planned to do via logistic regression models at each transition point. Below, we describe the merging of OHSU&#8217;s ACS dataset with Oregon Medicaid data and Vital Statistics data, to achieve our goal for a dataset for the model population. Because we wanted to incorporate national estimates into our dataset, we used Bayesian logistic regression to integrate expert opinion into our estimates. We describe each of these steps below.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Participants</title><p>To generate probability of ACS referral and post-discharge treatment engagement, we used Oregon Medicaid claims data to identify patients with OUD hospitalized at least once from April 2015 through August 2018, including IMPACT patients. Because OHSU IMPACT was the only ACS in Oregon during the study window, we used IMPACT registry which tracks all referrals to identify patients with Oregon Medicaid who were referred to ACS. To generate probability of 12-month mortality, we utilized mortality data from Oregon Vital Statistics through December 31, 2018; thus, we included only patients admitted through January 1, 2018 to allow 12 months of follow-up time. [Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were over 18 years old and had an ICD-9 (304.*) or ICD-10 (F11*) diagnosis of OUD during a hospital admission.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Cohorts for transition points</title><p>We defined three cohorts for our analyses utilizing Oregon Medicaid data. First, we included all patients who met eligibility criteria in analysis for our first transition, referral to ACS.

We matched without replacement on hospital admission quarter and admission number, including one admission per person.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Transition data</title><p>For ACS referral, we identified all hospitalized patients with OUD in Oregon during the study period, and then identified the subset who were referred to the ACS. For post-discharge OUD treatment engagement, we used Oregon Medicaid claims data to identify if patients met the modified HEDIS engagement measure in the 30 days following hospital discharge. For 12-month mortality, we used Oregon Vital Statistics data to identify deaths in our cohort during the study period through December 31, 2018. For mortality models, the cohort was limited to include only participants seen before January 1, 2018 to allow for 12 months of follow-up time for all participants. We classified deaths as drug related versus non-drug related as indicated above. We manually reviewed deaths that were not captured by these codes and reclassified to fit into drug versus non-drug related categories.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Transition probabilities</title><p>We used a Bayesian approach to obtain transition probabilities for our Markov model using Oregon data. In short, we integrated national expert information with estimates from Oregon data for each of our three transition steps: ACS referral, post-discharge MOUD, and 12-month mortality. We also adjusted for confounding at each transition point. Bayesian logistic regression allowed us to accomplish this goal. We ran logistic regression models for each transition point, using the transition as the outcome (i.e. an outcome of 12-month post-discharge mortality) and the prior step as the primary covariate of interest (i.e. 30-day post-discharge MOUD), adjusting for all other covariates in the model. We extract a marginal probability from this logistic regression model- this is our Bayesian likelihood. We used information from experts in addiction as our prior. The Bayesian approach allows the integration of the prior and likelihood to estimate a posterior probability, which we use as our posterior probability.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Bayesian priors via expert elicitation</title><p>Because of the novelty of ACS, few published papers existed from which we could have derived prior estimates of transition probabilities for Bayesian analysis. Thus, we used expert elicitation to capture prior information for our models. The Bayesian process helped account for some for some of the uncertainty that comes from incorporating expert opinion. We identified important covariates at each transition point, including age (in years), gender (female/male), race (White/not White/unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic/Not Hispanic), concurrent alcohol use disorder (yes/no), concurrent stimulant use disorder (yes/no), hospital length of stay (in days), rural residence (yes/no), filled at least one prescription for medication for OUD in the month before hospital admission (yes/no), previously admitted to the hospital (yes/no), and Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) Score (continuous). The engagement model also included referral to an ACS (yes/no). The mortality models included engagement in care after discharge (yes/no) and filled a naloxone prescription in the 30 days after hospital discharge (yes/no).</p><p>We used a clinical-vignette design to ask providers about the relevance of covariates on patient outcomes.

First, a recent paper used a similar approach and data structure to evaluate the impact of prenatal maternal factors on nonadherence to infant HIV medication in South Africa. After building our Bayesian model, we used the deidentified data from the South Africa analysis to attempt to replicate identical results as were published. The built model exactly replicated the results of the South African analysis. Second, we conducted classic logistic regression models for each transition point in addition to the Bayesian models. We placed a 1/3, 1/3 noninformative prior (Kerman&#8217;s prior) on all covariates, which should be roughly approximate to the classic logistic regression results. Our results with non-informative priors were sufficiently similar to classical logistic regression results. Finally, we conducted code &#8220;walk throughs&#8221; as suggested, where the analyst (CK) walked through code with an expert in these methods (RC).</p><p>In addition to the above steps, because we used Bayesian analyses for our transition probabilities, we needed to ensure that our final estimates of confidence intervals around engagement and mortality estimates actually encompassed the observed number of people who engaged, and people who died from drug-related and non-drug related deaths. We simulated estimates, generating &#8220;Low&#8221; and &#8220;High&#8221; modeled estimates based on &#8220;best&#8221; and &#8220;worst&#8221; cases of model dynamics (e.g. lower confidence bound of estimate for ACS referral, lower confidence bound for post-discharge OUD treatment engagement, upper confidence bound for drug-related mortality generates an estimate for &#8220;High&#8221; death). Of the 6,654 patients with 12 months follow-up time, the model estimates that 1,330.8 patients engage in care (Low, High = (1,064.6, 1,597.0)). We observed 1,318 patients who engaged in care in the cohort. Additionally, the model estimated 357.2 drug related deaths (Low, High = (98.5, 632.6)); there were 114 observed drug related deaths in the dataset. Similarly, the model predicted 570.8 non-drug related deaths (Low, High = (263.6, 865.0)); there were 408 observed non-drug related deaths in the dataset. Mortality analyses rarely account for all sources of follow-up which may mean that reported mortality estimates in the literature are lower than in reality. Thus, it was not surprising that modeled transition probabilities from Bayesian logistic regression for 12-month mortality may be higher than raw observed proportions.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Cross-validation</title><p>Researchers at a separate academic medical center have developed, validated and calibrated the Reducing Infections Related to Drug Use Cost-Effectiveness (REDUCE) model, a Monte Carlo microsimulation model [<xref rid="pone.0256793.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This model has the capacity to answer similar questions to what we post here, using estimates derived from published data and from expert sources.

First, as previously mentioned, the REDUCE model simulates data from patients who inject drugs, while ours models patients who have OUD more generally. There are important demographic differences between these two groups, including that our model also includes patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer. Next, the percentage of people seen by an ACS in the REDUCE model was higher than in our model: 25% of patients in REDUCE were seen by an ACS versus 4% in our model. The REDUCE model uses data from Boston, where higher numbers of patients are seen by ACS. This makes it challenging to understand REDUCE estimates in the context of Oregon specifically. Additionally, patients had a higher post-discharge treatment engagement rate in the REDUCE model. In REDUCE, approximately 25.2% of patients receive medication for OUD for at least one week in the month following discharge, versus our model, where 20% of patients not seen by an ACS receive MOUD after discharge. Finally, data from the first simulated admission was used to estimate 12-month mortality from REDUCE; because we matched our cohort controls on the number of previous admissions among patients seen by an ACS, it is possible that our patients were older and sicker than patients who had never previously been admitted to the hospital. While the base model structures are similar, our model is populated with data that provides a focused understanding of addiction consult services in Oregon. Populating our model with different data, including Boston estimates, could provide tailored explorations of ACS in different settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>External validity</title><p>To examine external validity, we used large, high-quality, recent studies of representative populations in independent cohorts of participants to separately validate post-discharge OUD treatment engagement and 12-month drug related and non-drug related mortality.

We used a Bayesian framework to integrate clinical expertise with data from Oregon Medicaid claims to estimate transition probabilities in our model. After development, we validated our model using ISPOR-SMDM standards, evaluating face validity, internal validity, cross validity, predictive validity and external validity.</p><p>Compared to the REDUCE model&#8212;another model that assess ACS care delivery&#8212;our estimates are more context-relevant estimates of post-discharge OUD treatment engagement and 12-month drug and non-drug related mortality in Oregon. Our overall mortality estimate is higher than the REDUCE model, which may reflect severity of illness of people who are older, sicker, with more previous inpatient hospitalizations and limited linkage to post-discharge OUD care in Oregon. This is important as one potential use of our populated model is to predict the impact of expanding inpatient ACS care in Oregon; a model populated with Oregon data may better reflects the local care setting at baseline may provide more accurate results following intervention. Additionally, populating our model with different data in different ACS context may similarly provide tailored results.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, because we sought to build a model that reflected addiction care in Oregon, the model may not be generalizable to other settings. Still, the Oregon experience may help inform modeling in other states with limited ACS uptake, and we used Bayesian estimates from national experts to inform transition probabilities. Second, Medicaid claims data are often inaccurate in classifying patient race and ethnicity; our study estimates may not correctly capture the experience of people of color in Oregon. Third, we originally planned to use 30-day mortality as an outcome for this study, but we were unable to do so because of limited drug-related mortality in the 30-day post-discharge period; we used 12-month mortality data instead. Fourth, deriving Bayesian priors from expert elicitation may be less than ideal; clinician estimates may be inaccurate. However, in the absence of published priors available for our transition probabilities, expert elicitation was an appropriate first step to help answer these research questions. Finally, Medicaid claims data does not separate costs for inpatient delivery of medication for OUD, so it was not possible to tell if patients received OUD inpatient outside of an ACS.</p><p>This model can be used to evaluate changing scenarios of care in spaces where healthcare providers, healthcare systems, or policymakers are considering implementing or changing ACS coverage in their applicable system. Specifically, this model has been used to evaluate the impact of expanding ACS in Oregon on post-discharge treatment engagement, and to estimate the impact of increasing fentanyl in Oregon&#8217;s drug supply on post-discharge overdose deaths. Results from these analyses have been submitted to help inform Oregon Medical Association and Oregon Hospital Association decision-making about ACS expansion in the state. The strength of the model comes from the estimates used to populate it, and with recalibration, the model can be adapted to different settings of ACS care delivery. For example, a different hospital with an ACS could estimate transition probabilities by using this model and their own local data. Similarly, hospitals considering ACS expansion could use our Bayesian estimate of ACS effectiveness (derived with a prior from sites across the United States) and combine this with local data for other estimates. This could provide hospitals with an estimate of what might be feasible with ACS implementation. In this paper, we describe data that reflects ACS care in Oregon. Using this data, we can model changing scenarios of care in Oregon, from increasing ACS care delivery to implementing drug-policy related changes, potentially including reducing barriers to naloxone access, implementing safe consumption sites or safe supply interventions, and others. Future research should use this model to evaluate changes in care delivery in Oregon to understand how these changes may impact survival among patients with OUD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hospitalization is a critical time for patients with OUD, and addiction consult services can help support patients during hospitalization and connect them to post-discharge care. Markov modeling can help researchers, clinical teams and policy makers understand how changes in care systems might impact patient outcomes. Additionally, our model allows healthcare systems and policymakers to evaluate the impact of ACS on mortality. In this work, we built and validated a Markov model that reflects the trajectories of care and survival for patients hospitalized with OUD in Oregon. Future research should use this work to evaluate state-wide clinical and policy changes that may impact patient survival.</p></sec><sec id="sec029" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting

The topic is indeed very important given the state of the opioid crisis and the purpose of modeling the effect of such services can be significant in helping other health systems model the impact of creating similar addiction services.

However, given Plos one has a wide array of readers from different research areas, it is likely others will also require further explanation of this process and I provide some comments below with specific questions/suggestions about the methods and elsewhere.</p><p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript with regards to your points below, and believe this has improved readability, particularly for audiences from different research areas. </p><p>Intro</p><p>1. The 20% of people who die from a drug overdose is an estimate from one study/region - authors should include the word &#8220;an estimated 20%&#8221; to clarify this is not necessarily a comprehensive/representative rate.</p><p>We have made this change (Introduction, paragraph 1). </p><p>2. The second sentence ends quite abruptly with &#8220;also contribute.&#8221; (contribute to risk of death among this population?)</p><p>We have updated to include the following:</p><p>&#8220;Among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), an estimated 20% eventually die of drug overdose (2), but cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases also contribute to mortality rates.&#8221; (Introduction, paragraph 1).</p><p>3. Given some readers of Plos One may not have a background in addiction treatment, the intro should at least give 1-2 more sentences about what it means to start people on MOUD in the hospital and transition them to ongoing care.</p><p>We have updated to include the following:</p><p>&#8221;Hospitalization is a vulnerable time for patients with OUD. People with OUD may leave the hospital before completing recommended medical therapy if withdrawal symptoms are untreated (3). People who withdraw from opioids have lower drug tolerance and increased risk of drug overdose after discharge in the absence of treatment for OUD (4-6). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, can reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose in patients with OUD (7). These medications work as opioid receptor full agonists (methadone), partial agonists (buprenorphine), or antagonists (naltrexone) (8). Despite the success of MOUD to reduce opioid overdose deaths, most hospitalized patients with OUD are not started on MOUD (9, 10), though, when offered, nearly three-quarters of patients with OUD choose to start MOUD (11). Interventions to improve initiation of MOUD among hospitalized patients are urgently needed (12).&#8221; (Introduction, paragraph 2).</p><p>4. The fourth paragraph should refer to &#8220;simulation modeling&#8221; rather than modeling so the reader knows what type of modeling is being referred to</p><p>We have made this change (Introduction, paragraph 4).</p><p>Methods</p><p>5. The entire order of the methods section is very confusing. It is not clear what piece of the process came first, what estimates are derived from the Oregon data itself vs. the simulated model or even what data were used for deriving these estimates and the model parameters. I recommend the section begin by describing all the datasets and variables that were used in this analysis and then moving chronologically through the process of generating the model and the estimates. For example, it&#8217;s unclear if the authors had data on ACS participation or if this was simulated. It is unclear how these data were linked (if at all) - the hospital ACS information, the Medicaid data, and the mortality data. Related to the prior comment, it is not clear how the models are taking into account the different characteristics of people who do and do not get referred to an ACS - for example, a person referred to an ACS can be at a much more advanced stage of OUD and therefore have higher mortality than someone who was never referred - how is that taken into account? Later the authors mention covariates but there is no explanation of how they get incorporated into the Markov model (again, this may be my limitation in understanding, but an explanation of how/if this comes into play would be helpful)</p><p>Thank you for this very helpful comment. We have reorganized the methods to make our order of steps clear. For example, we now state:</p><p>&#8220;We developed and validated a Markov model to estimate the impact of ACS care on 12-month mortality among hospitalized patients with OUD (Fig 1). We organize our methods in the order of completion: first, we decided on model structure, next we used available data to populate the model, and last, we validated the model. As such, we describe: 1) model structure, 2) model data, and 3) model validation.&#8221; (Methods Paragraph 2). </p><p>We then number to delinate each step, and then provide additional introduction sections where we thought there was confusion. For example, at the beginning of the model data step, we wrote the following, which also highlights the integration of observed ACS data, Oregon Medicaid data and Vital Statistics data. </p><p>&#8220;We had multiple goals in using data to populate our model. We needed a dataset of patients, where some patients were referred to ACS and some were not. Then, we needed to be able to match ACS patients to controls as one way to account for some confounding. We needed the dataset to follow both patients referred to ACS, and those not, through 12 months after hospital discharge. Finally, we needed the dataset to have additional covariates to control for additional confounding, which we planned to do via logistic regression models at each transition point. Below, we describe the integration of OHSU&#8217;s ACS dataset with Oregon Medicaid data and Vital Statistics data, to achieve our goal for a dataset for model population. Because we wanted to incorporate national estimates into our dataset, we used Bayesian logistic regression to integrate expert opinion into our estimates. We describe each of these steps below.&#8221; (Methods Paragraph 8)</p><p>We have also clarified where data is from simulated vs observed estimates, for example,</p><p>&#8220;Among this subset, at twelve months, 114 (1.7%) participants died from drug-related causes and 408 (6.1%) died from non-drug related causes. Participant demographics of observed data are included in Table 1.&#8221; (Results Paragraph 1)</p><p>We included the following sentence to highlight that ACS referral data was observed:</p><p>&#8220;Because OHSU IMPACT was the only ACS in Oregon during the study window, we used IMPACT registry which tracks all referrals to identify patients with Oregon Medicaid who were referred to ACS.&#8221; (Methods Paragraph 10)</p><p>Confounding was accounted for by extracting estimates from logistic regression models that accounted for confounders. So, for example, we used logistic regression to evaluate the impact of post-discharge MOUD on 12-month mortality, accounting for confounders. From the adjusted model, we extracted the marginal probability of post-discharge MOUD; this is our base transition probability. The Bayesian model uses the national estimate from experts as our prior, and integrates the marginal probability from the logistic regression model, to give us an updated posterior probability that incorporates both estimates. We have updated the manuscript to better describe this for a lay audience:</p><p>&#8220;We used a Bayesian approach to obtain transition probabilities for our Markov model using Oregon data an describe this below. In short, we wanted to integrate expert information nationally with estimates from Oregon data for each of our three transition steps: ACS referral, post-discharge MOUD, and 12-month mortality. We also needed to adjust for confounding at each transition point. Bayesian logistic regression allowed us to accomplish this goal. We were able to run logistic regression models for each transition point, using the transition as the outcome (i.e. an outcome of 12-month post-discharge mortality) and the prior step as the primary covariate of interest (i.e. 30-day post-discharge MOUD), adjusting for all other covariates in the model. We extract a marginal probability from this logistic regression model- this is our Bayesian likelihood. We used information from experts in addiction (described below) as our prior. The Bayesian approach allows the integration of the prior and likelihood to estimate a posterior probability, which we use as our posterior probability.&#8221;(Methods, Paragraph 12)</p><p>Length of time with OUD was not available as a confounder, and is not possible to accurately calculate from Oregon Medicaid data. </p><p>6. The authors call this an &#8220;intention to treat&#8221; approach - which is a term used for randomized studies. Since this is not a randomized study, nor a quasi experimental study, it seems nonsensical to use this word as the process of whether someone is referred to an ACS does not seem to be random at all.</p><p>Thank you- we agree. We have updated to read as follows:</p><p>&#8220;For this model, all patients referred to ACS were included regardless of level of care engagement or specific services received.&#8221; (Methods, Paragraph 2). </p><p>7. I am wary of this process by which probability parameters are being estimated from expert opinion - clinicians are generally not good at guessing probabilities from their own experiences so it&#8217;s unclear how this is a meaningful source rather than estimates that have been derived in the literature for example? If this is indeed a valid method that has been used in the past to estimate probabilities of this nature, authors should in the least explain this process and cite reference to this method being a valid way to generate these simulations</p><p>Thank you for this comment. ACS are a novel intervention, and prior to this manuscript, there were no published estimates of the parameters we sought to evaluate for ACS involvement. Thus, we chose to use expert elicitation to derive study estimates. Often models rely on expert opinion when there is a lack of available data to inform model parameters. We agree that expert opinion may be less than optimal, however, the Bayesian process we used helps account for some of the uncertainty that comes from incorporating expert opinion. We have updated the methods and limitations to describe this (Methods, Paragraph 11; Discussion, Paragraph 3). </p><p>&#8220;Because of the novelty of ACS, few published papers existed from which we could have derived prior estimates of transition probabilities for Bayesian analysis. Thus, we used expert elicitation to capture prior information for our models. The Bayesian process helped account for some for some of the uncertainty.&#8221;(Methods, Paragraph 11)</p><p>&#8220;Fourth, deriving Bayesian priors from expert elicitation may be less than ideal; clinician estimates may be inaccurate. However, in the absence of published priors available for our transition probabilities, expert elicitation was an appropriate first step to help answer these research questions.&#8221; (Discussion, Paragraph 3)</p><p>8. There needs to be greater explanation of how the expert opinion probabilities were integrated with their actual estimates derived from Oregon data to inform the models ? Again, further explanation of Markov models may generally help readers from different disciplines better understand the methods for this paper and also the added value of using these models here</p><p>Thank you. We have updated to include the following:</p><p>&#8220;We used a Bayesian approach to obtain transition probabilities for our Markov model using Oregon data an describe this below. In short, we wanted to integrate expert information nationally with estimates from Oregon data for each of our three transition steps: ACS referral, post-discharge MOUD, and 12-month mortality.

The Bayesian approach allows the integration of the prior and likelihood to estimate a posterior probability, which we use as our posterior probability.&#8221;(Methods, Paragraph 12)</p><p>Results</p><p>9. In the first paragraph, who are the 6,654 patients? those seen by ACS?</p><p>Thank you- this sentence was confusing. We have rewritten as follows:</p><p>&#8220;There were 8,450 patients admitted at least once with OUD in Oregon from April 2015 through August 2018. A subset of 6,654 patients were seen by January 1st, 2018. Among this subset, at twelve months, 114 (1.7%) participants died from drug-related causes and 408 (6.1%) died from non-drug related causes.&#8221; (Results, Paragraph 1)</p><p>Discussion</p><p>10. It would be helpful to include greater discussion around how such modeling adds value - for example, how hospital systems may use such models to make calculations on value of incorporating such programs or how hospitals with ACS could use these modeling techniques to better understand their own population and how they can improve their protocols/systems.</p><p>We have updated the final paragraph of the Discussion to read as follows:</p><p>&#8220;This model can be used to evaluate changing scenarios of care in spaces where healthcare providers, healthcare systems, or policymakers are considering implementing or changing ACS coverage in their applicable system. Specifically, this model has been used to evaluate the impact of expanding ACS in Oregon on post-discharge treatment engagement, and to estimate the impact of increasing fentanyl contamination in Oregon&#8217;s drug supply on post-discharge overdose deaths. Results from these analyses have been submitted to help inform Oregon Medical Association and Oregon Hospital Association decision-making about ACS expansion in the state. The strength of the model comes from the estimates used to populate it, and with recalibration, the model can be adapted to different settings of ACS care delivery. For example, a different hospital with an ACS could estimate transition probabilities by using this model and their own local data. Similarly, hospitals considering ACS expansion could use our Bayesian estimate of ACS effectiveness (derived with a prior from sites across the United States) and combine this with local data for other estimates. This could provide hospitals with an estimate of what might be feasible with ACS implementation. In this paper, we describe data that reflects ACS care in Oregon. Using this data, we can model changing scenarios of care in Oregon, from increasing ACS care delivery to implementing drug-policy related changes, potentially including reducing barriers to naloxone access, implementing safe consumption sites or safe supply interventions, and others. Future research should use this model to evaluate changes in care delivery in Oregon to understand how these changes may impact survival among patients with OUD.&#8221; (Discussion, Paragraph 4). </p><p>11. Reviewer #2: The statistical analysis looks complete from the perspective of the data gathered, but it is not clear how this can be used by others in the field, especially by decision-makers in public policy.</p><p>Thank you. We have updated the Discussion; please see comment 10 above from Reviewer #1. Additionally, we have included Appendix 3, which is a lay-summary for healthcare policy makers who may wish to use the model to estimate policy changes.</p><p>12. The paper presents a Markov-chain based model to analyze data from patients suffering from OUD. A Bayesian regression-based model is used to estimate the transition probabilities of different stages. The data set is quite large, and the work is described well. While I do believe this work will benefit decision makers, the authors definitely need to do some additional analysis of what the impact is of the consultation service. What is the difference in mortality when they take the consultation service and/ or do not use the post-discharge treatment? Without this analysis, it is unclear what gap in the literature is filled and what the motivation is for this research: it just provides some data, but not clear how it may be used by decision-makers in public policy. It is possible to use steady-state probabilities to determine the long-run survival and mortality rates (see e.g., Gosavi et al., 2020). Further, even some basic analysis is possible from the probabilities in Fig 2: what is the probability that someone who took advantage of the consulting service survived, vs that of someone who did not? </p><p>Thank you. We agree. We had two goals for this work: to derive a simulation model using Bayesian techniques that could estimate post-discharge mortality, and to derive estimates of mortality under different conditions to answer pertinent health policy questions. This manuscripts addresses the first question. To answer the second, we conducted several other analyses, which we have described in publications that have been submitted elsewhere. These manuscripts estimate changes in treatment engagement and mortality outcomes in the context of ACS engagement. The first explores the impact of ACS expansion through Medicaid Coordinated Care Organizations in Oregon, on post-discharge treatment engagement. The second evaluates the impact of increasing fentanyl contamination in Oregon on post-discharge mortality, and elucidates the role ACS expansion could play in decreasing mortality. We originally considered combining all estimates into one paper. However, the work in this manuscript is itself novel in constructing the model, and, for maximum impact, we wanted to write the additional manuscripts with only as much technical information as was necessary to interpret model results. To achieve this balance, we decided to submit this manuscript as a model development and validation paper, with subsequent manuscripts geared at using the model to answer pertinent policy questions. In case of interest, abstracts from these two additional manuscripts are as follows: </p><p>Expanding inpatient Addiction Consult Services through Accountable Care Organizations for Medicaid enrollees: A modeling study </p><p>Introduction</p><p>Addiction Consult Services (ACS) care for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the hospital. Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) could enhance access to ACS. This study extends data from Oregon's only ACS to Oregon's 15 regional Medicaid Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) to illustrate the potential value of enhanced in- and out-patient care for hospitalized patients with OUD. The study objectives were to estimate the effects of 1) expanding ACS care through CCOs in Oregon, and 2) increasing community treatment access within CCOs, on post-discharge OUD treatment engagement. </p><p>Methods</p><p>We used a validated Markov model, populated with Oregon Medicaid data from April 2015 to December 2017, to estimate study objectives.</p><p>Results</p><p>Oregon Medicaid patients hospitalized with OUD with care billed to a CCO (n=5,878) included 1,298 (22.1%) patients engaged in post-discharge OUD treatment.

Ten of fifteen (66.7%) CCOs had fewer than 20% of patients engage in post-discharge OUD care.
