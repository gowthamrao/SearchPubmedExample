Despite substantial efforts, achieving sustained smoking cessation continues to be a significant public health challenge. In 2022, 67.7% of the 28.8 million US adults who smoked expressed a desire to quit, and 53.3% attempted to do so. However, only 8.8% successfully quit smoking [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This limited success highlights the complexity of the cessation process, driven by a multitude of biological, psychological, and social factors. Advanced research methodologies are needed to better identify the key predictors of cessation behaviors and improve the efficacy of future interventions.</p><p id="P8">Smoking cessation success is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, including genetic [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], psychological [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], social and environmental elements [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which interact in dynamic and multifaceted ways. Better understanding of the key predictors of cessation success is essential for enhancing quit rates. Traditional machine learning methods, such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest, have demonstrated their efficiency in automatically identifying variables significantly associated with smoking behaviors within extensive datasets [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These methods, however, require rigorous training on empirical data to be effective.</p><p id="P9">Unlike classical machine learning models, several recent studies have indicated the potential of large language models (LLMs) in performing feature selection based solely on textual descriptions of survey variables, without direct access to the dataset [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ability to pinpoint important variables predictive of tobacco use behaviors without conventional data access could be invaluable in the design of surveys. LLMs are deep learning models with a massive number of parameters that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to perform a variety of tasks such as language translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, text generation, information retrieval etc. [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

By leveraging their advanced natural language processing capabilities, LLMs have the potential to transform data interpretation and inform decision-making processes in public health and clinical settings.</p><p id="P10">The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study is a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study that collects comprehensive data on participant socio-demographic information, tobacco use patterns and habits, tobacco risk perceptions, and health status among others [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is an invaluable resource for studying smoking cessation behavior. In this study, we investigate the use of a LLM &#8211; OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4.1 - in identifying the most important predictors of smoking cessation success in the PATH data. We first employed GPT-4.1 to perform feature selection based solely on the text descriptions of the variables, without accessing the actual data. Then we used XGBoost to evaluate how well these GPT-4.1-selected features are at predicting smoking cessation success in 2 years using the PATH data. XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and integrates them to enhance prediction accuracy, while also handling large datasets efficiently [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By leveraging the robustness and efficiency of XGBoost, we seek to 1) assess the efficacy of GPT-4.1 for text-based feature selection, 2) gain deeper insights into the factors that facilitate or impede smoking cessation success. The pioneering use of LLMs to study smoking cessation behavior will pay the way for future exploration of this innovative approach to address other tobacco-related issues. This study&#8217;s findings could inform targeted interventions and policies designed to support individuals in their efforts to quit smoking, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Data</title><p id="P11">For this study, we utilized data from the adult PATH survey [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] waves 5 (December 2018 to November 2019) and 6 (March 2021 to November 2021). The adult PATH study employs a four-stage stratified sampling design to collect data from individuals aged 18 and older, both tobacco users and non-users, who live in U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized settings [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The combination of these two waves provides us with a robust sample size for assessing smoking cessation success defined as 12-month smoking abstinence. The cohort included current smokers who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes in their lifetime and were smoking some day or every day at wave 5. Among 34,309 adults who completed wave 5, 25,743 (75%) also participated in wave 6. Of these, 6,120 (24%) were classified as current smokers in wave 5 and had a non-missing 12-month smoking status in wave 6. Smokers were considered to have successfully quit smoking if they had not smoked a cigarette in the 12 months leading up to the wave 6 survey. Among 6,120 smokers from wave 5, 496 (8%) successfully quit by wave 6.</p><p id="P12">We started with a merged wave 5 and wave 6 dataset that consists of 2,315 wave 5 variables, encompassing participants&#8217; various social demographic characteristics, heath status, and tobacco-related information among others. We first filtered the data to include only current smokers from wave 5, removing not directly relevant variables such as survey weights, random variables, and those with more than 2.5% missing data or low variation. Missing values were imputed using mean for numerical variables and mode for factor variables. Subsequently, we eliminated highly correlated variables with a cutoff probability of 0.75 to further reduce the number of independent variables and enhance the performance of downstream models.</p><p id="P13">Our final dataset contains 6,120 wave 5 current smokers, of whom 496 individuals were abstinent from smoking for 12 months by wave 6, and 303 wave 5 variables, which were used for further analysis. Of these variables, we employed GPT-4.1, a state-of-the-art LLM from OpenAI [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], to select the top 45 most important variables from wave 5 in predicting smoking cessation success in wave 6. This selection was based solely on the textual descriptions of the variables, rather than their values. Subsequently, we trained XGBoost on the data with GPT-4.1-selected variables to evaluate the efficacy of GPT-4.1 in context of feature selection and gain insights into quitting behavior. The dataset was divided into training data (80%), which was used for fine-tuning XGBoost&#8217;s hyperparameters and training XGBoost, and test data (20%) which was exclusively for evaluating the performance of XGBoost on unseen data. We used GPT-4.1 to perform feature selection based solely on textual descriptions of survey variables, i.e., without access to the actual dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Feature Selection</title><p id="P14">To enhance the performance of XGBoost and decrease computational costs, we leveraged GPT-4.1 to conduct feature selection using prompting techniques to identity a subset of the most informative wave 5 variables that are highly predictive of smoking status in Wave 6. Specifically, we crafted prompts that presented the model with descriptions of PATH survey variables one at a time, using the model to assign a numerical score ranging from 1 to 100, with 1 being the least influential and 100 being the most influential, to reflect each variable&#8217;s importance in predicting smoking cessation status. Notably, while the model processed the descriptive text of each variable, it did not have direct access to any actual data within the dataset. Additionally, we did not provide the model with any survey details or context. We anticipated that the model&#8217;s extensive training would enable it to effectively rank these variables based on its pre-existing knowledge. Further details on our prompt design can be found in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix</xref>. Due to random nature of LLMs, we requested GPT-4.1 to rank each variable 50 times and each variable&#8217;s the final score is the average of 50 scores to obtain robust rankings of these variables. The efficacy of GPT-4.1 in the context of text-based feature selection would be evaluated using XGBoost in the following section.

To evaluate the performance of XGBoost on the test data in each case, we conducted a series of experiments with 1000 different splits of the training dataset into training and validation subsets. For each experiment, several hyperparameters of XGBoost [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] such as learning rate (<italic toggle="yes">eta</italic>), maximum tree depth (<italic toggle="yes">max_depth</italic>), minimum child weight (<italic toggle="yes">min_child_weight</italic>), subsampling (<italic toggle="yes">subsample</italic>), and column sampling (<italic toggle="yes">colsample_bytree</italic>) were optimized using Bayesian optimization [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] within predefined parameter ranges to enhance model performance, see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table A1</xref> in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix</xref>. These parameters helped balance learning speed, control model complexity, and ensure generalization by using subsets of features and data at each iteration. The <italic toggle="yes">scale_pos_weight</italic> parameter, which addresses class imbalance in the dataset, was set to 3.4, calculated as the square root of the ratio of the number of successful quitters to the number of unsuccessful quitters at the time of the wave 6 survey.

Averaged AUC and its standard deviation were computed after 1000 runs. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were calculated after each iteration to determine the contribution of each variable to the model&#8217;s predictions. SHAP, a technique based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory, are used to explain the output of machine learning models [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For a given an observation, SHAP values quantify each feature&#8217;s contribution to the deviation of the individual prediction of that observation from the average model prediction [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Features with positive SHAP values positively influence the prediction, while those with negative values exert a negative impact. By aggregating SHAP values from the 1000 runs, we aimed to gain insights into the directional impact of each instance on the model&#8217;s predictions and to identify the top 10 most important variables for predicting participants&#8217; 12-month smoking abstinence status.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Results</title><p id="P17"><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the basic demographic characteristics of our study sample.

When training XGBoost, 12-month smoking abstinence status is encoded as 1 if an individual reported having not smoked in the past 12 months at time of wave 6 survey, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, variables&#8217; values with negative SHAP values are associated with a decreased likelihood of having not smoked in the past 12 months, while those with positive SHAP values indicate an increased likelihood. For example, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows that individuals with a high &#8220;past 30-day cigarette smoking frequency&#8221; in wave 5, which indicates greater nicotine dependence, were less likely to achieve 12-month smoking abstinence in wave 6.

Leveraging its extensive pre-trained knowledge, GPT-4.1 was able to assign importance scores to wave 5 PATH survey variables for predicting 12-month smoking abstinence status in wave 6, using only variables&#8217; text descriptions and without direct access to the data. With the 45 highest-scored variables, XGBoost predicted smoking cessation status in the outcome wave with high accuracy. In particular, the performance of XGBoost trained with the 45 GPT-4.1-selected variables was similar to that trained with the 303 variables (AUC: 0.752 vs AUC: 0.749). This suggests the high quality of the selected variables, demonstrating the promising capability of GPT-4.1 and LLMs in general in performing text-based feature selection.

It is worth noting that our baseline population of interest consists of individuals who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoked cigarettes either some days or every day. This implies that current everyday tobacco users include a subset of our baseline population who smoked every day. These factors, directly or indirectly, reflect individuals&#8217; nicotine dependence levels, indicating that those with lower dependence were more likely to successfully quit smoking within two years [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p id="P25">Furthermore, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows that current every day electronic nicotine product users were linked to an increased probability of being 12-month smoking abstinent. The association between daily electronic nicotine product user and smoking cessation success has been controversial in the literature with previous studies reported different findings, see [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and references therein. More research into this issue is needed to reach a consensus on the role of electronic nicotine products in smoking cessation. Individuals whose important people had negative views on tobacco use and who did not spend time mostly with smokers were more likely to quit smoking compared to their counterparts [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This suggests that social environment plays a significant role in smoking cessation. In addition, smokers are moderately or very concerned about their future health due to their tobacco use were linked to an increased likelihood of achieving 12-month smoking abstinence. However, this association has not been well-reported in the literature (for example [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported similar finding to ours, while [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] did not). Finally, our findings also indicate that current smokers who completely agreed with the statement &#8220;smoking/using tobacco product(s) really helps me feel better if feeling down&#8221; in wave 5 were correlated with successfully quitting smoking by wave 6. In summary, further studies are required to verify the associations that are not yet well-established in the literature.</p><p id="P26">In addition to GPT-4.1, we tested older versions of OpenAI&#8217;s GPTs (e.g., GPT- 3.5-TURBO and GPT- 4&#8211;0613). While these models generally performed reasonably well, GPT-4.1 provided more robust importance scores compared to the others. Future studies focusing on testing and comparing different available LLMs would be beneficial in selecting the best model for text-based feature selection. With classical machine learning methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost, we have a clear understanding of the criteria (e.g., SHAP values [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease impurity [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) that are used to provide importance scores for variables. However, it is important to note that for LLMs, we do not know the criteria on which their provided scores are based [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because the findings of this study are based on the PATH data, it also bears the limitations of the PATH study [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, this study highlights the promising capability of LLMs, particularly GPT-4.1, in identifying the most important variables for predicting 12-month smoking abstinence using solely variable descriptions, without direct access to the dataset itself. Leveraging this ability among many others, LLMs can be used to aid researchers in designing survey questionnaires by allowing them to focus on the most relevant factors, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float"
