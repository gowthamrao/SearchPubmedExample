One reward-related behavior that develops during adolescence is social behavior.

We thus hypothesized that morphine exposure during the female critical period would result in adult sociability deficits in females, but not males, and morphine administered during the male critical period would result in adult sociability deficits in males, but not females.

We thus hypothesized that the developmental stage of morphine exposure will differentially impact social behavior development in each set such that: (1) morphine administered during the female critical period will result in adult sociability deficits in females, but not males, while (2) morphine administered during the male critical period will result in adult sociability deficits in males, but not females. We restricted morphine administration to either the female or the male adolescent critical periods in rats, and then measured their sociability in adulthood. We found that morphine exposure during the female critical period primarily resulted in deficits in sociability in females, while morphine exposure during the male critical period resulted in deficits in sociability primarily in males. However, depending on the test performed and the social parameter measured, social alterations could be found in both sexes during morphine exposure at either adolescent stage.

Prior to morphine or vehicle exposure, rats to be exposed to morphine during the female critical period were handled for ~5 mins twice daily on two separate days. Rats to be exposed during the male critical period were handled for ~5 mins once daily on five separate days. During the final handling session for rats to be exposed to morphine during both critical periods, injection acclimation with vehicle was performed. Irrespective of the age exposure, morphine was injected at a dose of 3mg/kg for the first three days and 6mg/kg for the last two days (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3.</label><title>Behavioral tests</title><p id="P7">Experimental rats (P75+) and their sex- and age-matched novel conspecifics were handled for ~5 mins on five different days in the room where all behavioral tests were to be performed. The order of behavioral tests was counterbalanced and one behavior test per day was performed. Social choice tests (which we shall refer to as social vs object choice), social interaction, and open field tests were recorded for 10 mins using ANY-Maze Behavioral tracking software. The first 5 mins of social vs object choice and social interaction tests and full 10 mins of open field were used for analysis. For the open field test experimental rats were placed in an empty open field box with overhead recording. The time spent in the center (inner zone) was automatically quantified using ANY-Maze software. For social vs object choice testing rats were first acclimated (~10mins) in the empty three-chamber box. The three-chamber box is a behavior box with three compartments, an experimental compartment is placed in between two flanking smaller compartments where rats or objects can be placed and separated from the experimental compartment by a transparent plastic wall with several small holes not large enough for an animal to move across. Overhead video recordings of the social vs object choice tests were collected and hand coded by a blinded experimenter with Solomon Coder software (Andras Peter; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://solomoncoder.com/" ext-link-type="uri">solomoncoder.com</ext-link>) for the time spent in social exploration (zone in experimental compartment proximal to novel conspecific) and nonsocial exploration (zone in experimental compartment proximal to novel object) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Social interaction tests were performed in empty rat housing cages. Rats were acclimated for ~10 mins to the interaction cages prior to each experiment. Novel social interaction was performed by placing an experimental rat and a novel age- and sex-matched conspecific in the same cage for 10 mins. Familiar social interaction was performed with pair-housed cage mates re-paired for the test after a ~20min separation. Interaction behaviors were quantified using Solomon Coder software separating out four social behavior phenotypes, 1. Active social is defined as the rat facing conspecific and physical contact with conspecific, 2. Passive social is defined as the rat facing the conspecific and no physical contact with the conspecific, 3. Nonsocial contact is defined as the rat not facing the conspecific and physical contact with the conspecific, 4. Nonsocial attention is defined as the rat not facing the conspecific and no physical contact with the conspecific.

Two-way ANOVAs were used to calculate main effects (Drug and Sex) and interaction (Drug X Sex). P23-27 and P31-35 exposure groups were performed at different times rather than simultaneously and had different handling protocols due to pre-weaning handling being required for manipulation during the female critical period. Thus, we will analyze those data separately rather than including adolescent stage as a third independent variable.

However, familiar interaction tests are just one type of social behavior. We next sought to better understand how morphine exposure would impact novelty-directed social behaviors. In social vs. object choice tests, there was no evidence that morphine exposure during the female critical period influenced the social vs object choice in males nor females (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).

Moreover, how one assesses social behavior can also impact whether a social phenotype will be observed after adolescent morphine exposure.</p><p id="P15">Herein we discuss social behavior under the construct of sociability. Sociability is the tendency of individuals to associate with other individuals. This behavioral construct excludes behaviors that are primarily influenced by reproductive- and parental-related behaviors [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Sociability can be further broken down into the identification, classification, integration, and response to social cues [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and is among the most complex sets of behavioral features controlled by the central nervous system [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our study focuses on changes in sociability in the context of rat models of social vs object choice and free social interaction tests. In social vs object choice, we define an increase in sociability as an increase in the time spent in social exploration and/or the social half. Interaction tests probed two aspects of sociability: (1) social touch is rats having physical contact with conspecifics [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and is quantified in active social interaction and nonsocial contact, and (2) Visual social attention is rats having conspecifics in direct gaze [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and is quantified in active and passive social interaction. Active social interaction is a mixed social phenotype containing both aspects of sociability while nonsocial attention is the absence of any social aspects quantified. Thus, we define an increase in sociability as an increase in time spent in active social, passive social or/and nonsocial contact. Finally, we found that morphine exposure did not alter anxiety-like or exploratory behaviors in the Open Field test (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, we interpreted results based on the assumption that deficits in social tests resulted from changes in sociability and were not affected by anxiety-like phenotype.</p><sec id="S14"><label>4.1.</label><title>Sex-specific vulnerability of social development to morphine during adolescence is dependent on adolescent period</title><p id="P16">Epidemiological data in humans indicates that acute exposure to opioids during adolescence increases the risk of psychiatric illness and substance use disorder later in life [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Developmental differences in response to opioids are documented in behavior [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], pain and hyperalgesia [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], glia [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and neurons [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We demonstrate that developmental stage and sex also play a role in the vulnerability to opioid exposure. This is an important link built on the knowledge that males and females adolescent development occurs at different periods, with females generally moving into puberty earlier than males [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] including social development [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, we expected that morphine-induced sociability deficits would differ by period of exposure, and that female deficits would be restricted to morphine exposure during the female critical period and vice versa for males. The reality was more complex, which we will discuss further below. Discriminating sex and period specific opioid use vulnerabilities during adolescent social development will inform best practices around opioid prescriptions for adolescents which impair social behavior later in life. However, unexpectedly, these two injection periods also appeared to be differentially modulated by vehicle injections. Injection stress has been reported to alter normal development in rodent models [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We did not have an injection-naive group for comparison to directly test injection stress, however, we report that period of injection stress results in different levels of sociability that prevented us from analyzing the data using a statistical approach to include period of morphine exposure (3-way ANOVA: drug x sex x age). Thus, these adolescent periods may be vulnerable not just to morphine or injection stress, but to many different stressors. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a large long-term study of juvenile neurodevelopment [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The ABCD study may reveal grey and white matter changes that are associated with adolescent adverse experiences such as the effects of acute opioid exposure.

While there is agreement that multiple adverse experiences across development lead to worsening effects, whether these effects build up by worsening of specific behavior features or whether different adverse experiences alter different behavior features are in the early stages of study [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is plausible that adolescent opioid exposure primes individuals for worsening social development and subsequent adverse experiences cause progression of deficits. It will be important to determine in future studies whether different addictive substances or other stressors impact social development in similar or different ways between the sexes. An integrated model of unexpected stress after adolescent morphine exposure during the male and female critical period may answer the question of the sex and period specific vulnerabilities followed by additional adverse experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><label>4.2.</label><title>Social abnormalities depend on how you assess social behavior</title><p id="P17">Social context influences the type of social response [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Males, but not females, exposed to morphine during the male critical period of social development had decreased sociability (reduced active social interaction) indicating a male-specific social developmental vulnerability induced by morphine at this stage of adolescence (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Conversely, morphine exposure during the female critical period increased sociability (reduces nonsocial behaviors) compared to vehicle groups in females, but not males. Although familiar interaction tests are infrequently used in the literature, we propose they make a strong addition to a social behavioral battery. Familiar social relationships like families fill a core and often life-long social role in one&#8217;s life [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our studies, rats were pair housed with a sex-, age- and treatment group-matched rat, and thus these rats had a matched history of morphine or vehicle exposure. Hence, if morphine exposure did induce social deficits, we expected these to be magnified due to the presence of at two socially deficient rats. Substance use disorder is affected by worsening of both familial and broad social bonds [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], our results suggest that even an acute exposure leads to lasting social deficits. Thus, with respect to models of drug exposures, we argue that familiar interaction tests are an essential complement to tests with novel social stimuli and may be more sensitive to subtle differences in social behaviors.</p><p id="P19">The social vs object choice test assesses the natural proclivity for rats to prefer novel social stimuli over novel nonsocial stimuli [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and is a frequently used and simple test of sociability in rodents. Unlike the familiar interaction test, neither male nor female rats exposed to morphine during the female critical period for social development had any changes in sociability in this test (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Similar to the familiar interaction test, males, but not females, exposed to morphine during the male critical period for social development had reduced sociability (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Novel social interaction test assesses the quality of free social behavior with a novel conspecific [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. To our surprise, there was very little change in novel social interaction in the experimental rats (those that received morphine or vehicle during adolescence). Morphine exposure during the female critical period for social development had no sociability deficits (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), while there was a main effect of morphine exposure during the male critical period, resulting in increased sociability (increased active social interaction) that appeared to be present in both sexes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P21">There are few instances in the literature in which the conspecific&#8217;s social behavior is coded alongside the experimental target&#8217;s behavior.

Research in humans indicates that people tend to spend more time interacting with neurotypical persons [<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], this can be among the reasons people with psychiatric illness or substance use disorder are more likely to have insufficient social connections that get worse with time and disease progression [<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Understanding the responses naive individuals have to individuals that have social deficits is therefore an important aspect to model. Thus, we decided to code both sets of social behavior in case there was an altered social response in conspecifics due to the adolescent morphine/vehicle history of their social partners. Our data reveal that conspecific, non-manipulated rats do indeed respond differently depending on whether rats were exposed to morphine during adolescence (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). In fact, these differences were far more robust in the conspecifics than in the experimental animals to which they were responding. Because there are few overt social changes in the experimental rats in this test (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), these data suggest that social partner rats can identify differences in behavior caused by adolescent morphine exposure, which in turn elicits different behavioral responses. Interestingly, analyzing the behavior of the naive conspecific rats may shed light on deficits that are beyond the limitations of our study design. What the conspecifics are responding to is unclear at this point, however, we speculate the possibility of olfactory, vocal, and rodent body language signals that we were not measuring in the current studies [<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. These more covert social cues will be important to assess in future studies. Regardless, it is important to distinguish effects of opioids in different spatial and social contexts because therapeutic approaches could be optimized by adequate social environment cues, an idea supported by work indicating that volitional abstinence from addictive substances can be induced by social interaction [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>4.3.</label><title>Importance of social function in substance use disorders</title><p id="P22">There is extensive literature acknowledging that addictive substance use during adolescence disrupts normal adolescent development [<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].

Adolescent social development in males and females regulated by the nucleus accumbens (NAc) requires synaptic pruning and occurs earlier in females P20-28 than males P30-38. Male synaptic pruning is aimed at downregulating Dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) positive synapses by tagging with complement factor 3 (C3), an &#8220;eat me&#8221; signal for microglia phagocytosis. In females, synapses are tagged by C3 for pruning but the target(s) for pruning on synapses are unknown [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

We have shown that morphine modulates phagocytosis of microglia in vitro through activity on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], and thus we predict that morphine increases pro-phagocytic neuroinflammatory profile of microglia via TLR4 during sex specific critical periods causing increased pruning and sociability deficits in adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>4.5.</label><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p id="P27">The golden standard in rodent drug studies is self-administration [<xref rid="R118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, <xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>].
