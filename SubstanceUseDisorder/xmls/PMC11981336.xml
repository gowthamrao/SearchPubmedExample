Protocols for effective management of burn pain vary and mostly rely on opioids, a drug class well-known for dependence and adverse effects from misuse.

In 2019, a total of 8&#160;955&#160;228 new cases (95% uncertainty interval 6&#160;820&#160;977&#8211;11&#160;157&#160;666 cases) of burns were reported worldwide. Men and women made up about equal numbers of these cases, with the majority falling within the 10- to 19-year-old age range[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Burns are a major cause of both acute and persistent pain. Burns produce pain by irritating and stimulating nociceptors in the dermis and epidermis, which send A-delta and C nerve impulses to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Along with the production of several compounds that sensitize and activate the harmful substances on the site of damage for many days, the brain&#8217;s descending and peripheral impacts alter the magnitude of the impulses<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. There are two categories of pain experienced in burn injuries. Procedural or evoked pain is experienced during predictable incidents (e.g., following a procedure) or with activities (e.g., movement, physical therapy, and dressing changes). These are usually intense but temporary, in addition to the background pain, which is felt even when at rest and is not triggered by anything. Overall, it is believed to be less severe than evoked pain, but it is persistent. Exacerbations may occur spontaneously and for no apparent cause<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The extent of involvement in the body surface area affected and the depth of the skin injury are used to classify the severity of the burn[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Superficial burns cause more agony than full-thickness burns, where the nerve endings are either destroyed or severely damaged. Scales like the abbreviated burn severity index are used to determine the severity of a burn injury based on the total body surface area (TBSA), burn depth, the presence of an inhalation burn, age, and gender[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These scales are important in providing information on the patient&#8217;s prognosis and the treatment plan[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Given the complexity of the factors influencing pain, treating burn patients requires a multidisciplinary approach[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Opioids were the main type of analgesics used, but they are associated with a high risk of opioid-related disorders and opioid dependence[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This has led medical professionals to create novel strategies and procedures aimed at lowering opioid overdose and dependency. Numerous studies have indicated that a lidocaine infusion is effective in treating pain when other medications fail<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Comprehensive evidence is required to assess the safety and effectiveness of lidocaine infusions in the treatment of burn pain. Therefore, we have systematically reviewed and summarized the data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to guide clinical practice. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of lidocaine infusion in reducing pain and opioid use in patients with burn injuries, as well as assess the side effects and adverse events associated with lidocaine infusion in burn pain management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. The study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, the study has been critically appraised using AMSTAR (Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) checklist[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Randomized controlled trials were included, either published in peer-reviewed journals or posted results on ClinicalTrials.gov, studying patients with burn injuries of any age and gender who required pain management and comparing intravenous lidocaine infusions to placebo or other standard pain management interventions. Therefore, we included studies with lidocaine infusion of any dose and duration, morphine of any dose and route regardless of other analgesics, change in morphine consumption and pain score regardless of the time interval, any pain score, and pain of burn or during dressing/procedure. The primary outcome was a decrease in opioid consumption. The secondary outcomes were pain scores measured using three different pain scores and incidence of side effects and adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, convulsion, and urine retention). The pain scores are the visual analog scale (VAS) in the study by Abdelrahman, 2011[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], verbal rating scale (VRS) in the study by Wasiak, 2011[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) range in the study by Haghighi, 2023[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each scales provide evidence to support test&#8211;retest reliability and ratings of them strongly supporting validity<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, but each scale has its power and limitations across different populations<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. However, VAS can be more sensitive to any small alterations in pain<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Unlike the NRS and VRS, it has been found to be easier to use than the VAS with lower incorrect response rates and it was also found to be more sensitive to alterations in pain[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These scales are widely trusted and validated across different age groups, although it is found to be affected by both cultural and demographic factors[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The VAS is great for adults and older children because it measures pain intensity precisely. However, it can be difficult for younger children or people with cognitive impairments. The VRS, which categorizes pain as mild, moderate, or severe, works well for children, older adults, and those with difficulty in understanding more complex scales. The NRS, where patients rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, is simple and validated for use in adults, children, and the elderly. Studies, like the study by Madelon <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, 2007, have shown that these pain scales are effective and reliable across different age groups, making them invaluable tools for assessing pain in children, adults, and the elderly[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>We excluded other types of studies, like case reports, cohorts, and review articles. Clinical trials with no control group were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Search strategy</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, from March 16 to 10 June 2024. The same search strategy was applied in all databases which were [(lidocaine OR lignocaine OR xylocaine) AND (burns) AND (analgesia)]. There was no restriction on language or publication date, and no filters were used. Also, we manually searched the references and similar articles in the included articles. Two of the four studies included are published in one or more of the databases listed above (Wasiak, 2011; Abdelrahman, 2020). One study (Haghighi, 2023) was cited in a PubMed article. The fourth study was a clinical trial registry found on ClinicalTrials.gov. The process of screening was reported using the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of the study selection process.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ms9-87-1628-g001.jpg"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction and management</title><p>Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. The full-text articles were screened for eligibility based on their methodology and relevant outcomes. The discrepancy during the screening was solved by a third author. Data were extracted using Google Spreadsheets by two independent authors and revised by a third one for any conflict. These data include study characteristics, participant details, intervention specifics, and outcomes. Three RCTs reported morphine consumption and pain score using mean and standard deviation (SD), while the fourth unpublished data used median and interquartile range (IQR), so we converted median and IQR into mean and SD using a formula reported in Wan&#8217;s paper, 2014[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The formula used the median, sample size, and the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles to calculate the mean and SD. In the Wasiak study, the morphine consumption was reported by mean and 95% confidence interval (CI), so the SD was calculated using the formula reported in the Cochrane library book[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The formula used the mean, percent of CI, number of participants, and upper and lower CI limits to calculate the SD. Abdelrahman&#8217;s study reported the morphine consumption and pain score in figures, so we used an online graph reader to obtain the mean and SD from the figures[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In some trials where the post-intervention SD was not given and could not be calculated, it was assumed to equal the baseline SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk of bias assessment</title><p>The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This evaluated five domains, including randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, the completeness of outcome data, and selective reporting of outcomes. The tool was used to assess the three published studies, and it indicates an overall low risk in all of them (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig position="float" id="F2" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Risk of bias assessment summary for the included studies.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ms9-87-1628-g002.jpg"/></fig>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This review and meta-analysis article aimed to assess the effectiveness of lidocaine infusion in reducing opioid use in patients with burn injuries. Our results revealed a small, insignificant reduction in morphine use and a decrease in pain scores. Intravenous lidocaine has been used to reduce multiple acute and chronic types of pain, such as neuropathic pain, headache, burn pain, renal colic, limb ischemia, and postoperative pain[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It works by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibiting nerve conduction and interrupting pain transmission. By doing so, it prevents the use of large doses of opioids[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. That is why several RCTs evaluated the effect of lidocaine on opioid consumption for procedural pain, and they reflected conflicting findings<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. The focus of this study is pain associated with burns, which affects millions worldwide and leads to persistent neuropathic pain regardless of progress in patient care[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Neuropathic pain reduces quality of life and appears as tingling, burning, shooting, or electrical pain<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup>. Risk factors for neuropathic pain include the elderly, alcohol, smoking, substance abuse, a greater TBSA, and longer hospitalizations[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The literature recommends the use of lidocaine as therapy for neuropathic pain, and other literature indicates opioid-based treatment as the best choice for treating burn patients<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup>. A RCT conducted in 1999 opened the area for discussion on the effect of lidocaine on opioid dependence. They found a reduction in pain scores and no need for opiate supplements in burn patients using intravenous lidocaine[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Morphine consumption</title><p>In our meta-analysis, burn patients in the lidocaine group used less morphine than those in the control group, which means more opioid-sparing in the lidocaine group. However, the differences between these two groups were not significant, which indicates some differences that can be further studied in future trials. The non-significant result can be due to the small number of studies included in our meta-analysis and also to the significant variability among them.</p><p>The need for lidocaine as adjuvant therapy in burn patient therapy can be justified by the severity of pain and the opioid dependency when morphine is used alone[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Opioid-based analgesics are thought to be the best option for treating burn pain. However, a variety of adverse effects that are frequently dose-related can be brought on by opioids<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup>. Lidocaine was known to be used in several procedural pains to reduce opioid dependence. Some trials have found similar results to our meta-analysis. In these trials, lidocaine was used in robot-assisted colorectal surgery and post-operative pain<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, in colorectal surgery, more opioid consumption was reported among the lidocaine group[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similar findings were reported in thoracic surgery and gynaecological surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup>. The earliest trials of the use of lidocaine in burn patients have shown some efficacy in reducing opioid consumption[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pain</title><p>When investigating the effectiveness of lidocaine infusion in decreasing pain in burn patients &#8211; adding to the heterogeneity of the studies &#8211; there were significant differences between lidocaine and control groups as the lidocaine group had lower pain scores. However the difference in reducing pain score from baseline was not significant among the two groups. This may indicate that the significant difference in post-dressing pain scores may be attributed only to different baseline pain scores rather than the ability of the drugs to reduce pain. However, lidocaine has been reported to be effective in different types of acute pain. It has reported higher efficacy compared to morphine in surgical acute abdomen (renal colic) and vascular conditions (critical limb ischemia)[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Lidocaine was also reported to be effective in reducing post-operative pain, both immediately and during the subsequent 24&#160;hours, but not after 48&#160;hours. It is mostly used with reported benefits in abdominal surgeries[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Side effects</title><p>Regarding side effects, our results were inconclusive. Nausea was reported approximately equally in both groups. As opioids were used in both groups, this may indicate that the induced nausea may be due to morphine alone and not the use of lidocaine. The nausea- and vomiting-inducing effects of opioids have been reported in many studies. It occurs due to acting on the chemoreceptor trigger zone, leading to an increase in vestibular sensitivity and a delay in gastric emptying<sup>[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup>. A previous trial also did not find any significant difference between the lidocaine group and the control group regarding incidents of nausea[<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].Other side effects were reported in the included studies. Some of them had higher incidents in the lidocaine group, such as numbness, tingling, and urine retention. While the rest of the side effects were higher in the control group, such as vomiting, twitching, and pruritus. In addition, no serious adverse events like convulsion, arrhythmia, or respiratory arrest were reported in all the included studies. This indicates the safety of intravenous lidocaine for managing burn pain. A study by Cassuto <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported euphoria and lightheadedness. However, no cardiovascular or respiratory side effects were noted. Notably, no tolerance or addiction was reported, as would occur with opioid use[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another paper by Cassuto <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> indicated the same as they reported normal Blood pH and cardiovascular function[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is hard to decide if the side effects were due to morphine, lidocaine, or both of them. However, several side effects have been found to have some association and underlying mechanisms. Twitching, numbness, and vomiting have been associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Pruritus was found to be associated with opioid use, and it is dose-dependent[<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Most of the reported side effects are manageable unless lidocaine toxicity develops. However, for toxicity to develop, the dose needs to be higher than 7 mg/kg in adults. This is higher than any dose reported in the included studies. Below this range, allergic reactions (such as pruritus, nausea, and vomiting) can occur. This can be avoided by a skin prick test or managed using histamine, epinephrine, or other drugs[<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Numbness, dizziness, and tingly sensations could be signs of central nervous system (CNS) penetration in cases of lidocaine overdose. These symptoms can also be prevented by maintaining a safe dose (below 4.5 mg/kg) and using a local vasoconstrictor. These initial CNS symptoms can be managed before they progress to seizures and cardiac arrhythmia[<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Heterogeneity</title><p>The studies we included in our meta-analysis covered a wide range of burn severities, with TBSA percentages varying from as low as 3% up to over 20%. This difference introduces some clinical variability. Generally, patients with larger burns experience more intense pain, often requiring higher baseline doses of opioids, which could affect the impact lidocaine has on reducing opioid use. The research on patients with burns that cover less than 20% of the TBSA, for example, may demonstrate a more pronounced decrease in opioid use than research on patients with more severe burns. These differences in burn severity between studies imply that patients may react differently to lidocaine depending on the size of their burns. Future studies that use more uniform TBSA criteria may be able to shed light on how lidocaine functions at different burn severity levels. Moreover, regarding pain score tools, methods used to measure pain varied between the research; some used the VAS, while others used the VRS, and others used the NRS. Although effective, each scale varies in sensitivity and may not be directly comparable. In pain measurement, this creates heterogeneity because results from several scales might not match exactly. Pain assessments across research would be more consistent if they used a uniform pain scale. Timing of the pain assessment was also different, which could affect how we interpret the results. Some studies measured pain relief just 24&#160;hours after a lidocaine injection, while others assessed it after 6&#160;days, and one study even looked at pain 12&#160;days later. The analgesic effect of lidocaine tends to change over time; pain, therefore, is subjected to variation if measured at varying stages. Standardizing the timing of pain evaluations in future research, preferably at a constant time point, should help reduce variability and provide more trustworthy results concerning lidocaine&#8217;s impact on opioid use. The fact that different lidocaine dosing methods were used in the research likely adds to the unpredictable nature of the findings. Because different techniques can affect the safety profile and efficacy of lidocaine, it is challenging to directly compare results across studies because of these variations in dosing schedules and dosages. A more uniform approach to dosage would reduce fluctuations and facilitate the assessment of lidocaine&#8217;s actual pain-relieving efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical importance</title><p>Examining the distinction between clinical and statistical significance is also crucial, particularly in smaller studies like this one. Although statistically meaningful results can be difficult to get with small sample sizes, the 95% CI occasionally suggests that treatment might have practical implications. Our results imply that the therapy is probably successful in lowering pain. Other outcomes, such as morphine consumption, have a CI ranging from &#8722;1.18 to 0.24, suggesting a trend toward a decrease in morphine use, which may be clinically significant for patients even though the results do not reach statistical significance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> =&#160;0.19).</p><p>The results suggest several key takeaways. First, the pain score data support using this treatment in clinical practice to help manage pain, which could be particularly beneficial for patients needing effective relief. Second, even when some outcomes (like morphine use) did not reach statistical significance, the CIs suggest that there might still be a real benefit. This could encourage healthcare professionals to consider the treatment, especially when reducing opioid use is important for patient safety and comfort.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This meta-analysis has important limitations to be considered. First, there was significant heterogeneity in most of the outcomes measured, especially the pain scores (VAS, NRS11, and VRS) due to the different scales used by the included trials. To adjust this issue statistically, we used the SMD to decrease the heterogeneity and make the analysis applicable. Second, the sample size was very small (152 patients) and included a diverse population, which may affect the reliability of the results. Some adverse effects, such as convulsions and arrhythmia, were more likely to be reported in a larger sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results were inconclusive about the safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine as an adjuvant in the analgesia of burns. The significant heterogeneity among the studies used in this analysis limits our ability to draw a definitive conclusion. Larger clinical trials with homogenous samples are necessary to increase the quality of data and decrease heterogeneity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Sponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Published online 07 February 2025</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval was not required as this was a systematic review study.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>No informed consent was needed for the systematic review.
