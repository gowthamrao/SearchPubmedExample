HCV infections are common among people who use drugs (PWUDs), when sharing needles, syringes, or other equipment for injected drugs. The advent of pangenotypic direct-antiviral agents (DAA) in 2017 transformed the treatment landscape for HCV, but PWUDs remain a complex and hard-to-treat population with high risk of HCV reinfection. The aim of this real-world analysis was to characterize the demographic and clinical features of PWUDs in Italy, also focusing on comorbidity profile, treatment with DAAs, resource consumptions for the National Health System (NHS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>During 01/2011&#8211;06/2020, administrative databases of Italian healthcare entities, covering 3,900,000 individuals, were browsed to identify PWUDs with or without HCV infection. Among HCV+ patients, a further stratification was made into treated and untreated with DAAs. The date of PWUD or HCV first diagnosis or DAA first prescription was considered as index-date. Patients were then followed-up for one year. Alcohol-dependency was also investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Total 3690 PWUDs were included, of whom 1141 (30.9%) PWUD-HCV+ and 2549 (69.1%) PWUD-HCV-. HCV-positive were significantly older (43.6 vs 38.5 years, p &lt; 0.001), had a worse comorbidity profile (Charlson-index: 0.8 vs 0.4, p &lt; 0.001), and high rates of psychiatric, respiratory, dermatological, musculoskeletal diseases and genitourinary (sexually transmitted) infections. Moreover, they received more drug prescriptions (other than DAAs, like anti-acids, antiepileptics, psycholeptics) and had undergone more frequent hospitalization, predominantly for hepatobiliary, respiratory system and mental disorders. DDA-untreated had significantly higher Charlson-index than DAA-treated (0.9 vs 0.6, p = 0.003). Alcoholism was found in 436 (11.8%) cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This Italian real-world analysis suggests that PWUDs with HCV infection, especially those untreated with DAAs, show an elevated drug consumption due to their complex clinical profile. These findings could help to ameliorate the healthcare interventions on PWUDs with HCV infection.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>drug abuse</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>alcohol dependency</kwd><kwd>real-world evidence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gilead and CliCon S.r.l.

Hence, the proper management of HCV infection in injecting or not only injecting drug abusers denotes a priority for several reasons: (i) they represent a risky reservoir for viral transmission<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> (ii) PWUDs have high morbidity and mortality due to limited access to treatments;<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (iii) therapy aimed at keeping viral load under control serves as a preventive measure to control virus circulation and transmission, new infections and re-infections.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Before 2014, the interferon-based HCV therapy, characterized by 24&#8211;48 weeks treatment, a complex adverse event profile and relatively low cure rates, made HCV cure arduous, mainly for fragile patients such as PWUDs.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The introduction of oral interferon-free direct-acting agents (DAAs) provided significant benefits to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of more than 95% with shorter treatment length and a less demanding patient management.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Nevertheless, despite the advantages of a high virologic response, DAAs might also expose patients to the risk of drug&#8211;drug interactions (DDIs), feasibly related to the metabolic pathway requiring P450 cytochromes and/or transport through P-glycoprotein (P-gp).<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is estimated that 30&#8211;60% of patients taking DAAs are at risk of clinically significant DDIs: this might be explicated by the fact that these patients are commonly burdened by several comorbidities requiring polypharmacy treatment regimens.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>To date, limited real-world studies are available on the clinical and therapeutic management of PWUDs, and this gap of information needs to be filled in view of the everchanging epidemiological scenario of HCV, especially after the introduction of pangenotypic DAAs in 2017. Over the last two decades, Italy has shown dramatically high numbers in HCV infections, and mortality rates from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, among the highest in Western Europe.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> So far, updated epidemiological estimates either for the general population or for PWUDs in Italy are currently inconsistent. Some modelling approaches based on Italian real-world data have been proposed to forecast HCV burden in upcoming years and the chances to achieve to reach the WHO elimination goals established within 2030.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Thus, the present analysis was undertaken to describe the current epidemiology of PWUDs in Italy, focusing on demographic features, clinical status, comorbidity profile, pharmacological treatments, and the deriving healthcare resource consumptions for the National Health System (NHS). A comparative evaluation was carried out firstly between on PWUDs with and without HCV infection, then the HCV positive population was analysed after stratifying patients into treated and untreated with DAAs. The additional investigation on HCV-infected PWUDs has been carried out to understand the possible epidemiological differences with the non-infected subjects and to describe treatment behaviours in the two cohorts in terms of both DAAs and comedications.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Data Source</title><p>This retrospective observational analysis utilized data retrieved from administrative databases, as previously described.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Briefly, the data were extrapolated from the administrative flows of a pool of Local Health Units (LHUs) geographically distributed in the Italian territory, covering approximately 3.9 million health-assisted residents. These databases include the healthcare services provided by the Italian NHS, which is funded on the principle of universal coverage of healthcare expenses for all national and legal foreign residents. Therefore, these databases are repositories of information to be used for reimbursement purposes. Specifically, the following databases were used: i) demographic database, which contains patients&#8217; demographic data, such as gender, age, date of death; ii) pharmaceuticals database, which collects information on drugs reimbursed by the NHS, namely the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, number of packages, number of units for each package, unit package cost, and date of prescription; iii) hospitalization database, which encloses all hospitalizations data, like discharge diagnosis codes based on ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes, Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) and DRG-related charge (provided by the NHS); iv) outpatient specialist services database, which includes information on specialist visits and diagnostic tests (date and type of delivery, description activity and laboratory assay or specialist visit fees); v) payment exemption database, which provides data of exemption codes that allow to waive the contribution charge for services/treatments in case of specific disease diagnoses.</p><p>In order to ensure data privacy, an anonymous and univocal numeric code was assigned to each patient, in full compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2016/679). The patient code allowed the electronic linkage between databases. All the results of the present analysis were provided in aggregated form, thus never attributable to a single institution, department, doctor, individual, or individual prescribing behaviours. Informed consent was waived because obtaining it was not possible due to organizational reasons (pronouncement of the Data Privacy Guarantor Authority, General Authorization for personal data treatment for scientific research purposes &#8211; n.9/2014). The participating LHUs are the owners of their data and CliCon S.r.l. Societ&#224; Benefit collected those that were necessary to perform the analyses. Each LHU was responsible for data extraction from its administrative databases and provided them to CliCon in an anonymized form.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the following Institutional Review Boards (or Ethics Committees) of the Healthcare Departments involved in the study: i) Comitato Etico Interprovinciale Area 1 (A.O.U.

Among them, HCV infection was detected through the hospitalization discharge diagnosis for HCV (ICD-9-CM codes 070.4, 070.5, 070.7) or exemption code (016) or by the prescription of DAAs (ATC code J05AP) (the detailed list of DAAs is provided in <underline><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=409134.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link></underline>), during all the available period. Based on the presence or absence of HCV diagnosis, PWUDs were divided into PWUD-HCV+ and PWUD-HCV- cohorts, respectively. HCV infection was searched throughout the period of data availability, therefore during the observation period no HCV negative subject switched his/her HCV status. After 2017, when pangenotypic DDAs were introduced in the clinical practice, PWUD-HCV+ with at least one prescription of DAAs (ATC code J05AP), were assigned into the PWUD-HCV+ treated cohort, while those without any DAA prescription were identified as untreated (regardless of the presence of therapies other than DAAs). The date of PWUD status detection or HCV first diagnosis or DAA first prescription was considered as index-date. Patients were characterized for their baseline variables during all the available period before the index-date and were followed-up for all the available period after the index-date, at least 12 months.

Particularly, a special focus was given to the impact of comorbidity profiles in infected subjects, the role of treatment patterns and the subsequent rebounds on the consumptions of healthcare resources for the Italian NHS.</p><p>Among the study sample, 3690 PWUDs have been identified. They resulted to be a young population of around 40 years, consistently with a very recent Italian survey conducted from July 2019 to March 2020, that reported a prominent use of opioids in subjects aged between 18 and 40 years.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> By considering all available periods across the database, nearly 30% of the included PWUDs had a co-diagnosis of HCV. A systematic review by Degenhardt et al reported a worldwide prevalence of injecting drug users in 2015 of 15.6 million people in the age range of 15&#8211;64 years, and 52.3% of them resulted HCV-antibody positive.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This discrepancy might be due to the variable percentage of PWUDs tested for HCV among Italian Regions that might underestimate the actual prevalence.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In the present analysis, 52% of PWUD-HCV+ were treated with anti-HCV DAA medications. Despite the growing spectrum of therapeutic options against HCV infection since 2015, a high number of people with chronic C hepatitis have not yet been treated, although access to care is warranted to all subjects with HCV infection, in view of the principle of equal healthcare coverage to every citizen warranted by the Italian NHS. A recent Italian survey reported that the number of treated PWUDs currently represents nearly half of the total,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and underlined the heavy stigma still surrounding this population together with possible constraints due to the complexity of such patients and the risk of DDIs. Though, our analysis pointed out a significant increase of PWUD-HCV+ patients treated with DAAs after 2017 (from 23.9% before 2017 to 67.8% after 2017) suggesting an improvement in HCV management and a broader accessibility to medications due to the advent of new-generation antiviral agents.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Based on AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) data, above 68,000 HCV patients received DAAs as to February 2017.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> According to the former AIFA rules, DAA treatment had to be restricted to patients with more advanced liver disease, namely those in the waiting list for liver transplant, with HCV recurrence after liver/solid organ transplant, and with severe extra-hepatic complications related to HCV infection. Reimbursability of DAAs was therefore granted only based on urgency of the hepatic clinical status, excluding patients with less advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F0&#8211;F2).<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> More recently, AIFA broadened the eligibility of HCV patients to DAA therapy up to 12 criteria including less severe clinical conditions.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>In our study, PWUDs were showed a complex comorbidity profile and an elevated number of concomitant treatments, mainly regarding anti-infective, neurological and cardiovascular medications and those related to musculoskeletal system, alimentary tract and metabolism. The trend was more evident among PWUD-HCV+, who showed a worse clinical picture supposedly due to underlying HCV infection, especially those untreated with DAAs. This is also reflected by a large utilization of co-medications in the same population, together to a remarkably higher rate of hospitalizations, due to co-infections and a variety of disorders in different districts and systems. Our local data are consistent with previous international reports stating that, in addition to blood-borne infections (ie HIV), PWUD-HCV+ are affected by several comorbidities including psychiatric (33.9%), respiratory (31.5%), dermatological (28.2%), musculoskeletal (26.6%), genitourinary (including other sexually transmitted infections, 25.8%), endocrine/metabolic (21.0%), cardiovascular (19.4%), neurological (17.7%), gastrointestinal (16.9%), hepatobiliary (15.3%), and renal systems (8.9%) conditions. Only 10% had no comorbidities, while 95% had multiple comorbidities.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The comorbidity and comedication profile of PWUD-HCV+ suggests a more challenging therapeutic choice for HCV treatment based on the described risk of DDIs between DAAs and underlying therapies.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This occurrence is potentially very impactive in patients with comorbidities treated with polypharmacy or in specific populations like PWUDs, often affected by coinfections and/or assuming illicit or substitutive substances and for whom the personalization of treatment remains important for minimizing the risk of clinically relevant DDIs while optimizing efficacy. Indeed, the higher number of comedications in the PWUD-HCV+ not treated with DAAs (compared to PWUD-HCV+ treated with DAA) might suggest a conservative prescriptive behaviour based on the avoidance of treating too complex patients at risk of adverse events and/or treatment failure due to DDIs. However, the worse comorbidity profile among DAA-treated HCV+ subjects might also feasibly reflect an early decision by the clinicians to first treat those with more advanced hepatitis C disease. The lower prescription of antiepileptics in PWUD-HCV+ treated with DAA might corroborate this hypothesis, despite recent evidence supports the efficacy of DAAs in achieving SVR despite concomitant ASM (antiseizure medication) use.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> PWUD-HCV+ group untreated with DAAs displayed a significantly more severe comorbidity profile, feasibly explicated by a more severe addiction-related pathology, but also by a higher medical visits number (on average, 8.5 vs 4.8 during first year of follow-up period), excluding that the lower DAA prescription rate might be due to a poorer medical assistance on this subgroup.</p><p>The analysis of healthcare resource consumptions enlightened that the management of PWUDs with a co-diagnosis of HCV is associated with higher number of drug prescriptions, specialist service deliveries, and hospitalizations with respect to patients without HCV diagnosis. Likewise, among the HCV+ patients, DAA-treated patients had higher healthcare resource consumption in terms of drug and specialist service prescriptions, in front of a lower hospitalization rate. This finding is in line with the current literature, reporting that PWUDs, especially those with HCV diagnosis, are frequently hospitalized.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>These results should be interpreted taking some limitations into account, above all lying in its observational design and the unavoidable flaws of the use of data retrieved from administrative databases. In fact, this approach might lead to a potential underestimation of clinical information on comorbidities and/or concomitant treatments that cannot be extrapolated from the database (also because underreported by patients) together with other potential confounding factors that might have affected the results. Besides, the comorbidities considered here were collected through the available data prior inclusion (using a proxy of diagnosis), thus there might have been an incomplete capture of some variables (ie disease severity). Moreover, primary care data cannot be extrapolated from the administrative database. Lastly, to select HCV positive population, we used hospitalization discharge ICD-9-CM codes, exemption code or prescription of DAA, and not molecular assays like anti-HCV antibody testing and HCV RNA that represent the golden standard for HCV diagnosis.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This real-world analysis conducted on a representative sample of the Italian population provided a description of the demographic and clinical profile of PWUDs with and without a co-diagnosis of HCV, and the healthcare resource consumption for their management. These findings can give novel insights on PWUD population, informing physicians, addiction centers and healthcare providers about the elevated risk of DDIs in these patients and about the complexity of their disease management. PWUDs are known to be burdened by several comorbidities that imply the use of polypharmacy regimens. This was particularly true in PWUD-HCV+ patients who showed a more severe comorbidity profile, especially if untreated with anti-HCV-DDA medications, and a challenging therapeutic management with an elevated number of prescribed co-medications. Moreover, an elevated consumption of healthcare resources was observed, especially among PWUD-HCV+ patients, in front of a reduced rate of hospitalizations rate in those treated with DAAs. Hence, given the primary importance of future HCV elimination, further efforts are required in the upcoming years to reduce the HCV virus reservoir, improve PWUD-HCV+ quality of life and limit healthcare resource consumption linked to HCV clinical burden. These data derived from the real clinical practice could be helpful to ameliorate the medical management of PWUDs with HCV infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to all the study group components of the participating Italian LHUs: Domenica Daniela Ancona (Dipartimento Farmaceutico, ASL BAT, Andria), Margherita Andretta (UOC Assistenza Farmaceutica Territoriale, Azienda ULSS 8 Berica, Vicenza), Antonietta Barbieri (SC Farmaceutica Territoriale, ASL VC, Vercelli), Fausto Bartolini (Dipartimento Farmaceutico, USL Umbria 2, Terni), Andrea Ciaccia (Servizio Farmaceutico Territoriale, ASL Foggia), Alberto Costantini (UOC Farmacia Ospedaliera, P.O. &#8220;Santo Spirito&#8221;, ASL Pescara), Stefania Dell&#8217;Orco (UOC Farmaceutica Territoriale, ASL RM 6, Albano Laziale, RM), Rossella Moscogiuri (Dipartimento Farmaceutico, Ospedale &#8220;SS.
