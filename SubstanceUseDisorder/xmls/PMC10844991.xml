Participant roles were administrators (17 participants [59%]), directors of nursing (6 participants [21%]), directors of admissions (5 participants [17%]), and unit managers (1 participant [3%]). Participants described active substance use, Medicaid insurance, housing instability, and younger age as potential barriers to SNF admission for individuals with OUD. The lack of formal guidelines for OUD management, staff shortages, facility liability, state regulations, and skills and training deficits among staff were cited among challenges of effectively meeting the needs of residents with OUD. Many participants reported inadequate institutional capacity as a source of negative outcomes for people with OUD yet expressed their concerns by characterizing individuals with OUD as potentially violent, nonadherent, or likely to bring undesirable elements into facilities. Participants also shared strategies they used to better serve residents with OUD, including providing transportation to support group meetings in the community, delivery in advance of resident arrival of predosed methadone, and telemedicine through the state&#8217;s hotline to prescribe buprenorphine.</p></sec><sec id="ab-zoi231604-9"><title>Conclusions and Relevance</title><p>In this qualitative study of administrator perspectives about admissions and care for individuals with OUD in SNFs, gaps in institutional capacity overlapped with stigmatizing beliefs about OUD; such beliefs perpetuate discrimination of individuals with OUD. Adequate SNF funding and staffing combined with OUD-specific interventions (eg, antistigma training, community partnerships for MOUD and recovery support) could incentivize SNFs to serve individuals with OUD and facilitate OUD care consistent with practice guidelines.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="H1-1-ZOI231604"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdoses have increased in nearly every age demographic in the US, with substantial increases among older adults.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Along with the high mortality associated with opioid use, opioid-related acute care use and hospitalizations due to infectious complications (eg, endocarditis and skin infections) have become more frequent.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Following hospitalization, individuals with OUD often require additional care to reduce the risk of complications, and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are an important location for managing subacute needs.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> One study<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> estimated that 16% of hospitalized patients with OUD were discharged to SNFs; this finding may underestimate the need for SNF level of care in a population where the 30-day hospital readmission rate was nearly 30% among all OUD hospital discharges.

Following reconciliation, a senior research team member (J.S. or P.M.) reviewed each coded interview. Emergent codes were incorporated into the codebook through an iterative process. After 1 round of coding, the coding team met twice to distill themes based on a review of the entire process, including the analytical memos generated throughout. Themes were further revised through discussion with the larger research team and study advisors, and reanalysis of interviews was conducted based on these discussions.

And then after that, they can&#8217;t continue to do so. So, that&#8217;s a little bit of a problem too.

Positive experiences with the state&#8217;s 24/7 buprenorphine hotline for OUD treatment were described in limited interviews.

Participants shared that their inability to find staff led them to decrease occupancy or close entire SNF wings. Many participants emphasized gaps in continuity of care resulting from staffing constraints, given high staff turnover and reliance on temporary or per diem nurses. Participants perceived that OUD-specific training would be necessary for staff; therefore, the lack of staffing capacity sometimes became further rationale for deprioritizing OUD admissions.</p></sec><sec id="H3-5-ZOI231604"><title>COVID-19</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated staffing challenges and contributed to substantial declines in occupancy rates.

Past experiences attributed to residents with OUD included overdoses within the facility, bringing unapproved substances into the facility, theft, and undesirable visitors that might alarm family members of residents. These concerns left many participants worried about the facility&#8217;s liability if staff or other residents were injured or harmed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H2-7-ZOI231604"><title>Theme 4: Concerns About Cost of Care, Funding, and Regulatory Oversight</title><sec id="H3-8-ZOI231604"><title>Poor Insurance Reimbursement</title><p>There was a common perception of residents with OUD being more costly than other residents because of generally lower acuity among younger residents and low insurance reimbursement for residents with OUD who were overwhelmingly on Medicaid. Some participants stated that MOUD may not be reimbursed, creating costs to the facility. Participants expressed concerns that behavioral issues in residents with OUD may cause the facility&#8217;s ratings to decline, in turn affecting reimbursement rates.</p></sec><sec id="H3-9-ZOI231604"><title>Regulations and Fines</title><p>State regulations and fees associated with resident outcomes were also of concern to participants. Additionally, participants emphasized that if they decided not to readmit a resident (eg, following a self-directed discharge), or if they did not provide adequate documentation that the facility cannot care for a particular resident, they would get cited.</p></sec><sec id="H3-10-ZOI231604"><title>Liability</title><p>Participants frequently spoke about the existence of a high burden of proof placed upon SNFs by the state to establish that a facility truly cannot care for a resident safely.

No participant described formal policy or admissions criteria for residents with OUD, but several described informal criteria used to evaluate admissions. The term stability was often used as a stand-in to reference these informal admissions criteria, yet participants were sometimes vague about what constituted that designation.

Participants often provided detailed descriptions of how past negative experiences in their facility reflected inadequate services and training, which interfered with caring for residents with OUD. Then, later in the interview, or sometimes even in the same passage, participants articulated stigmatizing generalizations to rationalize poor outcomes for this population.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI231604"><title>Discussion</title><p>This qualitative study elicited the perspectives of administrators on admissions and care for residents with OUD in SNFs. Several key findings emerged.</p><p>First, administrators pointed to persistent industry-wide challenges with funding and staffing<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> as factors that hamper their capacity and willingness to invest in and innovate around care for residents with OUD. Administrators expressed hesitance to admit individuals with OUD due to the absence of existing behavioral health services within the facility. Logistical aspects of initiating, continuing, and managing MOUD in SNFs were viewed as a major consideration in admission decisions. While individuals with OUD or receiving MOUD were less likely to be admitted, participants also reported that bringing one&#8217;s own MOUD upon admission and availability of a medical director willing to initiate buprenorphine increased the likelihood of SNF admission. Some administrators reported leveraging community-based resources for OUD treatment to address institutional gaps in OUD care. Specifically, the delivery of predosed methadone to SNFs by CODAC (the largest provider of behavioral health care in Rhode Island) and telehealth through the state&#8217;s 24/7 buprenorphine hotline were noted as resources.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The proposed federal Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access (MOTA) Act of 2023, which would allow methadone to be prescribed and dispensed outside certified opioid treatment programs, could enhance MOUD access in SNFs by allowing pharmacy-based methadone for OUD.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, SNF residents stand to benefit from permanent methadone reforms that eliminate regulatory barriers to accessing treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Second, interviews identified concerns about the age of residents with OUD; these concerns were based on past experience and overlapped with stigma-driven concerns in many interviews, revealing a convoluted amalgam of attitudes. The majority of administrators pointed to difficulties of integrating younger residents into programming and institutional culture historically designed with much older residents in mind. Some administrators depicted residents with OUD (who often are younger residents) as violent and nonadherent, posing a threat to older adults who were considered traditional SNF residents. Importantly, this conflation of OUD with younger age risks overlooking the rapidly growing dangers of drug-related morbidity and mortality among older adults.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Financial concerns were also a factor in age discrimination against younger people whose insurance reimbursements were perceived to be poor relative to older individuals who are mostly insured by Medicare.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Inadequate funding and reimbursements are a substantial threat to SNFs, and facilities where the majority of residents rely on Medicaid are particularly at risk of closure.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Therefore, financial incentives that encourage SNFs to admit younger people with Medicaid should be considered. Furthermore, the reduced occupancy rates in SNFs following the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that there may be business opportunities to extend admission to individuals perceived as nontraditional residents (ie, younger residents with OUD). For example, SNFs could establish specialized units designed to meet the needs of residents with OUD and other behavioral health needs. Some administrators considered such specialized units to have utility and likened them to memory care units, which are increasingly common.</p><p>Third, administrators commonly expressed seemingly self-contradicting views about reasons why residents with OUD may have poor experiences and outcomes. Administrators showed an understanding of <italic toggle="yes">institutional mismatch</italic>, a term we use to describe negative outcomes associated with residents with OUD being placed in facilities lacking the services, programming, or resources to fit their needs. We suggest the term <italic toggle="yes">stigma ambivalence</italic> to describe the ability of administrators to simultaneously recognize inadequate institutional capacity as a source of negative outcomes for residents with OUD, yet still redirect blame to individual residents for problematic behaviors and characteristics. In some cases, participants voiced ambivalence by noting that they should not generalize about groups but still holding that these generalizations held true. Even when participants did not express explicit stigma ambivalence, the uneasy interplay between 2 modes of explanation&#8212;one based on experience and the other filtered through stereotype&#8212;created a tension that differed from interviews characterized by more straightforward assertions of stigma. Stigma ambivalence made it impossible, in many cases, to distinguish between genuine concerns over possessing institutional capacity and stereotyping of individuals with OUD. Of note, some aspects of stigma presented in discriminatory practices (eg, blanket admission bans and rejecting individuals for receiving MOUD), which are expressly prohibited by protections for individuals with OUD under the American Disabilities Act (ADA).<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Despite challenging market forces, SNFs still need to comply with the protections for people with OUD or receiving MOUD afforded by the ADA. Capitalizing on the elimination of the buprenorphine X-waiver requirement and extended methadone take-home flexibilities could help reduce discrimination against individuals with OUD and build onramps to OUD treatment in SNFs.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> If passed, the MOTA Act would further reduce barriers to accessing MOUD in SNFs by allowing pharmacy dispensing of methadone for OUD.</p><p>While administrators recognized possible actions to remedy gaps in institutional capacity to provide enhanced care quality for residents with OUD, some administrators hesitated to take such actions to avoid attracting nontraditional residents. In this context, only in limited instances might SNFs voluntarily train staff or bolster infrastructure to support residents with OUD. Therefore, meaningful advancements toward accessible, evidence-based SNF care for individuals with OUD are unlikely without broader federal and state investment dedicated for this purpose.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Beyond financial incentives, such as increased Medicaid reimbursement, there is need for greater investment in existing or new partnerships to enhance stigma reduction and improve SNF relations with accountability structures. While more regulations are often not the answer, nuanced considerations of minimum standards of behavioral health services consistent with the level of care provided in SNFs are warranted.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-9-ZOI231604"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has limitations. Interpretation of our findings should account for attitudinal fallacy, the unfounded inference that views expressed in a single setting are undistorted indicators of real-world behaviors.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> More empirical work is required to reconstruct the dynamics of the admission process, including unconscious biases or views minimized due to social acceptability bias. It is noteworthy that a minority of participants were directly involved in patient care. The views of administrators may differ in important ways than direct care staff and others (eg, hospital discharge planners and social workers) who were not observed. Although semistructured interviews do not allow for a controlled comparison regarding attitudes toward different conditions, our interviews revealed that administrators frequently conflated people with OUD with other residents that placed strain on their facility in terms of cost, staffing, and culture. This finding suggests that our OUD-specific framing may capture only part of the pressures and constraints that informed their responses.</p><p>Our interviews may have been influenced by preceding judgements against SNFs for discrimination against people with OUD in the neighboring state of Massachusetts based on the expanded guidelines for OUD under the ADA.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Simultaneously, our study took place before affirmations of antidiscrimination protections became more widely publicized across the country, which may have allowed administrators to give voice to views that they would be more cautious in openly expressing today.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Finally, qualitative research among individuals with OUD with lived experience in SNFs deserves exploration in future research because these perspectives have not previously been described. They are essential, not only to design patient-centered OUD services in SNFs, but also to provide critical context to interpret the views expressed by SNF administrators. Future research exploring the intersectionality of OUD with other identities (eg, race, ethnicity, sex, and gender identity) is also warranted to promote equity in SNF access.<sup><xref rid="zoi231604r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231604r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Notwithstanding these limitations, our study makes novel contributions by elucidating the logistical challenges and potential solutions to providing MOUD in SNFs. Further, to our knowledge, stigma ambivalence has not been previously described in the literature on stigma and substance use disorders; therefore, naming this pattern adds novelty to the literature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI231604"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This qualitative study among SNF administrators found that being diagnosed with OUD introduced challenges to accessing SNFs and that opportunities to initiate or continue MOUD were inconsistent and often nonexistent across facilities. Administrators often expressed resource, training, or facility capacity concerns, yet these concerns overlapped with stigmatizing beliefs about OUD and prohibited discriminatory practices. Additionally, addressing longstanding SNF issues (eg, funding and staffing) and creating OUD-specific interventions (eg, antistigma training, community partnerships for MOUD, and recovery support) could facilitate SNF care for OUD that is consistent with practice guidelines.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI231604"><title>References</title><ref
