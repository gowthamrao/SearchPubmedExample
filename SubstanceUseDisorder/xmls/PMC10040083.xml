However, in principle all opioid OD are reversible with the timely administration of naloxone hydrochloride. Despite the widespread availability of naloxone among people who use opioids (PWUO), many who suffer fatal OD use alone, without others present to administer the reversal agent. Recognising this key aspect of the challenge calls for innovations, a number of technological approaches have emerged which aim to connect OD victims with naloxone. However, the acceptability of OD response technologies to PWUO is of key concern.
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Drawing on the Technology People Organisations Macroenvironment (TPOM) framework, this study sought to integrate acceptability-related findings in this space with primary research data from PWUO, affected family members and service providers to understand the factors involved in harm reduction technology acceptability.</p><p id="Par3">A qualitative study using a focus group methodology was conducted. The participant groups were people with lived experience of problem opioid use, affected family members and service providers. Data analysis followed a multi-stage approach to thematic analysis and utilised both inductive and deductive methods.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Thirty individuals participated in one of six focus groups between November 2021 and September 2022. The analysis generated six major themes, three of which are reported in this article&#8212;selected for their close relevance to PWUO and their importance to developers of digital technologies for this group. &#8216;Trust&#8212;in technologies, systems and people&#8217; was a major theme and was closely linked to data security, privacy and confidentiality. &#8216;Balancing harm reduction, safety and ambivalence&#8217; reflects the delicate balance technological solutions must achieve to be acceptable to PWUO. Lastly, &#8216;readiness&#8212;a double bind&#8217; encapsulates the perception shared across participant groups, that those at the highest risk, may be the least able to engage with interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Effective digital strategies to prevent fatal OD must be sensitive to the complex relationships between technological, social/human, organisational and wider macroenvironmental factors which can enable or impede intervention delivery. Trust, readiness and performance are central to technology acceptability for PWUO. An augmented TPOM was developed (the TPOM-ODART).</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12954-023-00763-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Opioids</kwd><kwd>People who use opioids (PWUO)</kwd><kwd>Overdose (OD)</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Harm reduction</kwd><kwd>Overdose alert and response technologies (ODART)</kwd><kwd>TPOM-ODART</kwd><kwd>Overdose digital technologies</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012095</institution-id><institution>Scottish Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1645421</award-id><award-id>1645421</award-id><award-id>1645421</award-id><award-id>1645421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Daneshvar</surname><given-names>Hadi</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Oteo</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Baldacchino</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Catriona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par14">The most recently available global data indicate that there were 128,000 deaths directly related to drug use in 2019, with 88,000 of these being associated with illicit and prescribed opioid use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. North America and parts of Northern Europe are disproportionately burdened by opioid-related overdose (OD) deaths, together accounting for more than half of this figure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada saw a 98% rise in opioid-related OD deaths, while the USA exceeded 100,000 annual deaths for the first time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At the same time, Scotland, in the UK, recorded a drug-related death (DRD) rate of 327 per million (aged 15&#8211;64) in 2020, which is more than twenty times the European average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Health, social and structural factors such as long-term drug use, history of overdose, criminal justice involvement, poor physical and mental health and housing status contribute to the risk of fatal OD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

However, in addition to predicting DRD, this risk profile also indicates contact with support services capable of altering an individual&#8217;s trajectory through the provision of harm reduction resources and advice.</p><p id="Par16">Fatal opioid OD are mostly preventable with the timely administration of naloxone&#8212;an opioid antagonist which temporarily reverses OD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] offered an overview of different technologies developed internationally to address fatal overdose. In summary, their review identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] wearable devices and sonar-based room sensors which detect indices of overdose and broadcast alerts, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] smartphone applications which monitor drug use, provide OD prevention information and/or support the development of naloxone responder networks.</p><p id="Par19">Across studies spanning the range of described technologies, Oteo et al&#8217;s review shows &#8216;trust&#8217; to be a prerequisite for the acceptability and feasibility of ODART interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pooled findings indicate, for example, a preference among participants (PWUO) for trusted individuals, as opposed to emergency services, to be alerted to OD events, due largely to fears of discrimination and potential arrest from accompanying police. Also, impeding acceptability for participants in some studies was a shared sense of within-group distrust, stemming from the perception that ill-intentioned peers (i.e. PWUO) might steal from OD victims to whose vulnerability they were alerted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Oteo et al&#8217;s review also revealed high willingness among PWUO with access to smartphone technology towards wearing various ODART devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Factors independently associated with willingness included being in methadone treatment, having previous experience of overdose and a history of chronic pain. Negatively affecting ODART acceptability, by contrast, was a perceived aversion among PWUO towards &#8216;losing a high&#8217; due to the effective administration of naloxone by responders. Two articles situated people experiencing homelessness/transient lifestyles and those with a low tolerance for opioids as having the most to gain from ODART interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Capturing greater detail on the scale of the challenge for ODART designers/implementers, however, Oteo et al&#8217;s review shows homelessness to be negatively associated with willingness to utilise (acceptability) and intervention feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]</p><p id="Par21">The study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of stakeholders&#8217; views regarding the acceptability of ODART for PWUO in Scotland. Guiding this undertaking, the Technology, People, Organisations, Macroenvironment (TPOM) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was selected and adopted for its capacity to incorporate the multi-faceted individual, social and environmental perspectives associated with digitally mediated interventions. Originally designed to guide both formative and summative evaluations in health informatics, the TPOM offers a useful framework through which to explore the population/purpose specific factors involved in the acceptability of technology for reducing fatal OD. However, the unique complexity of the ODART environment provides a strong argument for adjusting and augmenting the framework to maximise the fit for ODART acceptability, thus addressing a secondary aim of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p id="Par22">A qualitative study was conducted between November 2021 and September 2022 using a focus group methodology.

However, the TPOM, constructed from a substantial dataset covering a range of care settings, has demonstrated its capacity for supporting formative assessments of health information technology implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, the model was expected to permit sufficient characterisation of the target population, while capturing the technological and feasibility-related areas associated with digital OD intervention delivery. The exact role of the framework in the creation and organisation of data is clarified immediately below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par27">Guided by Braun and Clarke&#8217;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] approach, a mixture of inductive and deductive thematic analysis was used. For example, though research questions were exploratory and experiential, and therefore suited to an inductive approach, theoretical constructs were consistently used to interpret data or to &#8216;render visible issues that participants did not explicitly articulate&#8217; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. First, transcripts were read carefully twice with initial ideas being noted and revised iteratively. Second, line-by-line coding was undertaken using NVivo 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] qualitative data analysis software. This followed an inductive process which involved grouping meaningful units of text into analytic categories under provisional labels. Third, codes were collated into potential themes based on semantic consistency. Fourth, the fit between provisional themes, their constituent codes and data extracts were continually reviewed. Fifth, the ongoing refinement of themes included examining their relations to each other, and the TPOM framework. This involved a process of deductive analysis in which the identified themes (or thematic descriptions) were transferred onto the TPOM (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition to demonstrating model fit, this deductive approach served two functions: it (1) allowed data to be classified in ways relevant to ODART designers/implementers and (2) facilitated the streamlining of participant findings. Sixth, in the final analytic stage, extracts were selected which exemplified the themes in relation to the TPOM. A selection of relevant outputs from this final analytic stage follows in the next section in which an augmented TPOM for this target group and purpose is presented. Our analysis and adoption of framework was informed theoretically by the socio-technical approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>TPOM-ODART framework for PWUO</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12954_2023_763_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title>Findings</title><p id="Par28">All participants from each stakeholder group lived in Scotland.

The choice of themes, therefore, reflects a desire to establish the unique qualities of the population, and it is hoped to consider the model fit and support arguments for augmentation of the TPOM framework (see referent model in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Appendix 2).</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trust&#8212;in technologies, systems and people</title><p id="Par29">Spanning three dimensions of the TPOM, trust was a major theme relating to the acceptability of technological solutions for reducing OD. From a technological perspective, trust was closely linked to data security and permissions. Correspondingly, trust in service providers (i.e. those tasked with ensuring data protection) and potential OD responders was expected to determine ODART acceptability and use.

The socio-technical challenge this presents to designers and services working with PWUO was partially outlined by one LE participant, who, acknowledging personal risk, reflected on a recent using experience.<disp-quote><p id="Par57">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to use, and I don&#8217;t want anyone to interrupt me and I don&#8217;t want to be around anybody, but at the same time (&#8230;) this is super high risk and I definitely don&#8217;t want to die but I know that I could.&#8221; (LE)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par58">It was generally accepted that avoidance of fatal overdose supersedes any withdrawal experience precipitated by overdose reversal. However, in reference to an automatic OD response device (naloxone dispenser), another participant helped to further clarify the elusive &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; boundary between a desired &#8216;high&#8217; feeling and overdose, and the disruption and consequent upset that an unnecessary alert/response might cause.<disp-quote><p id="Par59">&#8220;It might just set it off if you are just really high, and on the edge of going over so then you are going to be pissed off.&#8221; (LE)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par60">In reference to the prototype automatic naloxone dispenser, one FM participant reasoned:<disp-quote><p id="Par61">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anybody consenting to that [naloxone implant].

However, the findings presented here referred most immediately to the challenges arising from the fit between the proposed technical solutions, at risk populations and the contexts within which interventions are to be delivered. Trust in technology, systems and people was regarded as central to the acceptability and feasibility of digital OD prevention interventions for PWUO. Trust was further implicated through its relationship to autonomy and capacity, factors which participants felt developers and intervention implementation teams must balance with the principles of harm reduction and the need to keep people safe. However, although at high risk of OD due to intersecting health and social care needs, participants questioned the &#8216;readiness&#8217; of some PWUO to engage with ODART, despite their standing the most to gain. Across groups, stakeholders agreed that multi-level buy-in would be essential to engaging those at risk and meaningfully reducing fatal OD. In response to the challenges identified, participants appealed to peer endorsement, and service provider support to promote the uptake and retention of PWUO in programmes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Integration with the current literature</title><p id="Par68">Trust was shown to be central to ODART acceptability in this study, confirming perhaps the most universal finding in this space. Explicit discussions of trust were reported in several of the reviewed articles above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while the concept was implicated in all but one of the remaining studies. Present findings align closely with those of Marcu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] who likewise found trust to have referents across technology, people and systems (i.e. statutory services). From a technological perspective, naloxone responder networks were trusted to reduce fatal OD. Where Marcu and colleagues found interpersonal trust to promote harm reduction education, this work showed peers in or seeking recovery to be preferred OD responders. Additionally, present results reinforce and expand upon accounts of within-group distrust highlighted in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], adding that individuals &#8216;in the throes&#8217; of active drug use would be the least trusted OD responders. Distrust of systems, and particularly the police and statutory services, was also confirmed by this work.</p><p id="Par69">Solutions to the readiness &#8216;double bind&#8217; for high needs PWUO, who stand to benefit most from interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] yet are unable to access them, are lacking. ODART, like other harm reduction interventions, demand a degree of client engagement if they are to be successful. However, the barriers identified above suggest that engagement with ODART entails comparatively greater engagement, than other options, and while the benefits are potentially considerable (e.g. prevention of death) they may seem more remote. In comparison, individuals utilising supervised consumption sites (SCS) are benefitting not just from monitored consumption, but also from the provision of a place to use around people in whom they have trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Take home naloxone (THN) has few, if any, engagement requirements and provision of the medication can be easily tacked on to existing interventions such as medication-assisted treatment and needle and syringe provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Drawing on this learning some PWUO might be engaged in ODART interventions through existing THN pathways, such as prior to release from prison or upon discharge from acute care and detoxification/residential rehabilitation services when opioid tolerance may be lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Building upon Scottish digital inclusion work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], present efforts also indicate that uptake of ODART among this population will necessarily involve peer champions and harm reduction-oriented organisations to promote awareness of, and trust in, interventions and will also require interventions to be co-designed appropriately for meeting end-users&#8217; needs.</p><p id="Par70">Present investigations identified a complex balancing of technological sensitivity, harm reduction and safety that must be achieved for digital OD interventions to be acceptable to PWUO. In essence, acceptable solutions are those which support autonomy around drug use, and operate unnoticed, with precision sensitivity, while being optimally accessible for individuals facing diverse and/or dynamic social circumstances. Consistent with earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], false positives were shown to be particularly unacceptable to PWUO due to their potential to precipitate opioid withdrawal following naloxone intervention. Attention to the calibration of various biometrics is seen as crucial to improving the specificity of OD detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Yet, findings from an SCS in Canada demonstrate how OD response can be made more acceptable to PWUO, through titration of naloxone and supplementary oxygen to avoid severe withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, while the minimisation of false positives might satisfy some PWUO to engage with ODART, pervasive health ambivalence presents a far greater challenge to the feasibility of digital OD prevention strategies. For present participants, such ambivalence, amid contexts of severe harm and death called into question the nature of capacity and consent. This tension between harm reduction and safety demands greater attention than it has so far received in the ODART literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>TPOM-ODART framework</title><p id="Par71">The TPOM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was selected for its capacity to accommodate stakeholder insights into the socio-technical task digital OD prevention presents to developers, implementation teams and supporters. As anticipated, the four broad dimensions of the TPOM were sufficient to help categorise data and support the visualisation of the interrelations between dimensions. However, while the emergent themes are in partial alignment with the referent model (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1), their discussion here supports the case to augment the model to better fit the population/proposed technological goal. Thus, spanning the technological and social/human dimensions of the TPOM-ODART (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) &#8216;readiness&#8212;a double bind&#8217; and &#8216;balancing harm reduction, safety and ambivalence&#8217; speak to socio-technical challenges highly specific to PWUO.</p><p id="Par72">Balancing harm reduction, safety and ambivalence&#8217; reflects the complex task of harmonising PWUO were described, through the living experience of participants, as seeking solutions which are so responsive and accurate (technological performance heuristic) that they can differentiate between a desirable level of heavy sedation and OD, alerting third parties only in instances of the latter. This desired borderline level of intoxication may be a norm among PWUO (attitudes and expectations heuristic), and particularly those at highest risk, for whom intervention acceptability may hinge on a single false positive.</p><p id="Par73">The new theme &#8216;readiness&#8212;a double bind&#8217; appears to sit well within the &#8216;people&#8217; dimension of the TPOM, yet the heuristic social/human factors derived by Cresswell et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] seem insufficient to accurately capture this pervasive feature of problem drug use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The original model factors of &#8216;engagement&#8217; and &#8216;user input in design&#8217; may speak to the maximisation of uptake of digital harm reduction interventions, yet for individuals with the highest needs, the right not to engage in treatment must be respected even in cases where severe risk to health is likely and capacity to consent either way is questionable. Once more reflecting the interrelated nature of the socio-technical challenge, this theme is closely linked to the technological factor of performance (e.g. to what extent do ODART interventions support OD prevention among high risk PWUO?) and so could plausibly be depicted as spanning both dimensions. The decision to situate this theme squarely in the social/human dimension, however, was determined on the merits of this being a distinctive feature of the population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par74">This work is timely and coincides with the urgent impetus to respond to DRD crises and significant political appetite, as well as the enhanced availability of digital healthcare funding since COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to attempt to combine primary data regarding the acceptability of technology for DRD prevention from the perspective of PWUO, affected family members and service providers. The specific strengths of this study lie in those areas which were identified as complementing the academic literature. For example, the themes presented here were intentionally selected for their capacity to elucidate the socio-technical task faced by technologists and intervention implementation teams. The subtleties of the challenge such as the delicate balances required to achieve acceptability may be highly specific to this population. Controversial issues relating to capacity and consent, as well as challenges concerning populations who may remain out of reach, despite programmes&#8217; best efforts, were also brought to the fore. The opportunity presented to support the development of the TPOM, and socio-technical theory more broadly was also welcomed.</p><p id="Par75">The pervasive experience of digital exclusion among PWUO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] likely limited the participant pool, and thus, the generalisability of any findings. For example, smartphone ownership and connectivity were 100% among LE participants, in stark contrast to estimates across the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Participation from individuals and groups involved in DRD prevention at the level of policy, and elected officials would have added finer detail concerning the macroenvironment, and thus, greater strategic insight into the overall feasibility of digital programmes. More fundamentally, hypothetical/perceived acceptability of ODART may be at odds with actual rates of usage. Thus, the integration of such devices will need to be trialled in real world settings to better understand acceptability/feasibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Relevance for policy and practice</title><p id="Par76">Findings from this work could be used to help shape and improve the challenges present for ODART developers. Services considering the adoption of existing technologies, or developing apps, should be sensitive to these findings to maximise utility.

An augmented TPOM framework called the TPOM-ODART was developed to support this area.
