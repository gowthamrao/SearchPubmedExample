The ability to accurately determine whether LRTI underlies or contributes to respiratory failure in the intensive care unit and to identify the etiologic pathogens is critical for effective and targeted treatments. However, LRTI diagnosis is challenging because noninfectious respiratory conditions can appear clinically similar. Moreover, no microbiologic diagnosis is obtained in many cases of suspected LRTI, since standard tests (such as bacterial culture) suffer from a narrow spectrum of targets and limited sensitivity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). At the same time, children are especially susceptible to false positive diagnoses due to frequent incidental carriage of potentially pathogenic microbes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As such, LRTI treatment is often empirical, leading to antimicrobial overuse, selection for resistant pathogens, and adverse outcomes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Profiling host gene expression in the blood has shown promise as an innovative modality for diagnosing respiratory infection in hospitalized patients (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, this approach has not been well studied in the diagnostically challenging critically ill pediatric population. Moreover, while blood gene expression can in some cases distinguish between the response to viral and bacterial infection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it cannot pinpoint the specific pathogens active in the respiratory tract, which is critical for optimal antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of lower airway samples (e.g., tracheal aspirate [TA]) has the potential to detect pathogens and host gene expression signatures of LRTI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Whether such an approach can be successfully applied at scale for the purpose of clinical diagnosis remains unclear. Its applicability in a pediatric population has also never been examined despite well-established age-related differences in LRTI epidemiology (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), rates of incidental pathogen carriage (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the immune response to infection (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, to our knowledge, no metagenomic approach for LRTI diagnosis thus far integrates host and microbial features into a single diagnostic output, a crucial step toward streamlined clinical application.</p><p>Here, we performed metagenomic RNA-Seq of TA in a prospective cohort of 261 children with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We developed a host gene expression classifier for LRTI by training on patients with an LRTI diagnosis supported by clinical microbiologic testing and patients with respiratory failure due to noninfectious causes. We then developed a classifier that integrates host, pathogen, and microbiome features to accurately diagnose LRTI and identify the likely causal pathogens, including in cases with negative clinical microbiologic testing. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of lower airway metagenomics for improved LRTI diagnosis in a large and heterogeneous cohort and reveal the importance of profiling both the pulmonary immune response and microbiome in a pediatric population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient cohort and LRTI adjudication.</title><p>We enrolled children with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation at 8 hospitals in the United States between February 2015 and December 2017, as previously described (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). TA was collected within 24 hours of intubation and underwent mNGS of RNA to assay host gene expression and detect respiratory microbiota (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). High-quality host gene expression and microbial data were obtained for 261 patients (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data File 1</xref>).</p><p>Adjudication of LRTI status was performed without knowledge of the mNGS results and depended on the combination of two elements: (a) a retrospective clinical diagnosis made by study-site clinicians, who reviewed all clinical, laboratory, and imaging data available at the end of the admission, and (b) any standard-of-care respiratory microbiologic diagnostics (NP swab viral PCR and/or TA culture) performed on specimens collected during the first 48 hours of intubation. Patients were assigned to their LRTI status group as follows: (a) Definite, if clinicians made a diagnosis of LRTI and the patient had clinical microbiologic findings; (b) Suspected, if clinicians made a diagnosis of LRTI, but there were no microbiologic findings; (c) Indeterminate, if no diagnosis of LRTI was made despite some microbiologic findings; and (d) No Evidence, if clinicians identified a clear noninfectious cause of acute respiratory failure and no clinical or microbiologic suspicion of LRTI arose. We note that comprehensive microbiologic testing was not always performed in the No Evidence group in the absence of clinical suspicion.</p><p>The Definite and No Evidence groups were used to develop the metagenomic classifiers and to evaluate their performance by cross-validation due to the high degree of confidence in their clinical diagnoses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The patients in the Definite group were 39% female, with a median age of 0.5 years (IQR, 0.2&#8211;1.8), while the patients in the No Evidence group were 50% female, with a median age of 6.5 years (IQR, 1.5&#8211;12.9; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI165904DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI165904DS1</ext-link>). The difference in the age distribution of these groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) reflected recognized epidemiological distinctions in the conditions that typically lead to respiratory failure in very young versus older children (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Within the Definite group, 95% of patients were intubated by 2 days from hospital admission, indicative of community-acquired infection (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clinical microbiologic testing identified viral infection alone in 46% of patients, bacterial infection alone in 14% of patients, and viral/bacterial coinfection in 40% of patients. The most common pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, which frequently co-occurred (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Diagnoses in the No Evidence group included trauma, neurological conditions, cardiovascular disease, airway abnormalities, ingestion of drugs/toxins, and sepsis that was clearly unconnected to LRTI. Nevertheless, most patients received antibiotic treatment by the time of TA sample collection in both the Definite (96%) and No Evidence (84%) groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of LRTI status based on TA host gene expression features.</title><p>We first compared TA host gene expression between the Definite and No Evidence groups to determine whether it could distinguish patients based on LRTI status, regardless of the underlying cause of infection. We identified 4,718 differentially expressed genes at a Benjamini-Hochberg&#8211;adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data File 2</xref>). As expected, gene set enrichment analysis identified elevated expression of pathways involved in the immune response to infection in the Definite group (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data File 3</xref>). Pathways related to the interferon response, a hallmark of antiviral innate immunity, were most strongly upregulated, consistent with the high prevalence of viral infections in the Definite group. Additional immune pathways upregulated in this group included Toll-like receptor signaling, cytokine signaling, inflammasome activation, neutrophil degranulation, antigen processing, and B cell and T cell receptor signaling.

The water controls allowed us to generate a background count distribution for each taxon, which modeled the contribution of contamination by microbes present in the laboratory environment or reagents.</p><p>Viruses with known ability to cause LRTI that were present at an abundance statistically exceeding their background distribution were considered probable pathogens. By this criterion, we detected viruses in the lungs of 107 of 117 (91%) patients in the Definite group, with RSV being the most prevalent (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Among patients in the No Evidence group, 8 of 50 (16%) also had viruses detected by mNGS, which were probably missed clinically in the absence of characteristic symptoms. We defined the summed abundance of all pathogenic viruses detected in a patient, measured in reads-per-million (rpM), as the patient&#8217;s &#8220;viral score&#8221; for later use in an integrated host/microbe classifier (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Because most patients in the Definite group had a positive NP swab viral PCR test, we could compare the viruses detected by PCR and mNGS (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data File 4</xref>). The comparison was complicated, however, by the fact that PCR was performed on upper airway samples, so a virus detected by PCR was not necessarily present in the lower airway. Bearing this in mind, we found that 99 of 101 (98%) patients in the Definite group with a viral PCR hit also had a virus detected by mNGS, and both approaches detected at least 1 virus in common in 91 (92%) of those patients (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Most cases in which NP swab PCR detected a virus, but mNGS did not, involved adenovirus (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). mNGS alone detected viruses in 8 of 16 (50%) patients in the Definite group lacking a viral PCR hit (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>).

Because incidental carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria is common in children, we additionally applied a previously published algorithm to distinguish possible pathogens from commensals, called the rules-based model (RBM) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The RBM identifies bacteria and fungi with known pathogenic potential that are relatively dominant in a sample (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C and D</xref>), based on the principle that uncontrolled growth of a pathogen leads to reduced lung microbiome &#945;-diversity in the context of LRTI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>, C and D).</p><p>The RBM identified possible bacterial/fungal pathogens in 78 of 117 (66%) patients in the Definite group, with the most common being <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">influenzae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The RBM also identified potential bacterial/fungal pathogens in 17 of 50 (34%) patients in the No Evidence group. Patients in the Definite group with an RBM-identified pathogen exhibited markedly lower bacterial &#945;-diversity compared with patients in the Definite group without an RBM-identified pathogen and compared with patients in the No Evidence group (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, patients in the No Evidence group with an RBM-identified pathogen did not typically exhibit a loss of bacterial &#945;-diversity (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4D</xref>), and in such cases, the RBM-identified species was far less dominant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We, therefore, defined the patient&#8217;s &#8220;bacterial score&#8221; for use in an integrated host/microbe classifier as the proportion of the nonhost counts assigned to the RBM-identified pathogens, a measure of relative dominance (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to compare the bacterial and fungal pathogens identified by mNGS with those found by culture of TA samples (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data File 4</xref>). Importantly, mNGS can detect organisms that are challenging to grow in culture or are inhibited by previous antibiotic treatment, and the RBM selects the likeliest pathogen based on a global view of the microbiome. Despite these inherent differences between culture and the RBM, we found that in 44 of 63 (70%) patients in the Definite group who had a positive culture, at least 1 pathogen identified by the RBM was also found by culture (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4E</xref>). In the remaining 19 patients, the RBM identified a different species than culture (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7) or no pathogen at all (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12). Even in these cases, the species grown in culture was usually present in the mNGS data, but other species were more dominant (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4E</xref>).

As expected, some of the interferon-stimulated genes (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">ISG15</italic>) provided much more discriminating power for patients with a viral infection as compared with those with a purely bacterial infection.

We fit a logistic regression model on the following features: (a) the LRTI probability output of the host classifier, (b) the summed abundance, measured in rpM, of any pathogenic viruses present after background filtering (the viral score), and (c) the proportion of the potentially pathogenic bacteria/fungi identified by the RBM out of all nonhost read counts (the bacterial score) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As expected, the host and microbial features were correlated across most samples, but some notable exceptions were observed (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The integrated classifier achieved a median AUC of 0.986 (range, 0.953&#8211;1.000) when assessed by 5-fold cross-validation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 5</xref>), applying the same train/test splits from the host-only cross-validation. Using a 50% out-of-fold probability threshold, the integrated classifier assigned 109 of 117 (93%) patients in the Definite group as LRTI<sup>+</sup> and 44 of 50 (88%) patients in the No Evidence group as LRTI<sup>&#8211;</sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 6</xref>). Compared with the host-only classifier, a net of 5 additional patients were now classified according to their clinical adjudication, and the confidence of patient classifications increased, as reflected by more extreme output probabilities (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

Across all 49 patients classified as LRTI<sup>+</sup> in these groups, likely pathogens (viral, bacterial, or fungal) were identified in 48 patients (98%).

Here, we demonstrated that mNGS of lower respiratory samples enables accurate LRTI diagnosis based on features of each of these key elements in critically ill children, a demographic facing a high burden of LRTI. We built on proof-of-concept work in adults (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to develop the first, to our knowledge, fully integrated host/microbe LRTI diagnostic classifier and validated its performance in a large, multicenter prospective cohort.</p><p>Incidental carriage of pathogens in the respiratory tract is common in children (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Consistent with this, detection of a pathogen by mNGS was in many cases insufficient for accurate LRTI diagnosis in our cohort. Among patients in the No Evidence group, 40% had potentially pathogenic microbes detected by mNGS even after application of the RBM (for bacteria and fungi). This is notably different from adults, for whom both clinical and metagenomic studies have demonstrated much lower rates of incidental pathogen carriage (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Profiling the host response is, thus, particularly important for pediatric LRTI diagnosis, as it provides evidence of an immune response to infection.</p><p>Remarkably, an LRTI diagnostic classifier based on host gene expression performed very well on its own, with a median AUC of 0.967 by cross-validation. The host signature was driven by activation markers of T cells, alveolar macrophages, and the interferon response and successfully captured cases of viral infection, bacterial infection, or coinfection. This performance suggests the gene signature could be incorporated into a clinical PCR assay as a standalone rapid diagnostic. It is likely that an even more parsimonious signature than the one used in the mNGS classifier would suffice, as 6 genes exhibited the most discriminating power.</p><p>The integrated host/microbe classifier achieved a median AUC of 0.986 by cross-validation. The incorporation of microbial features increased the confidence of LRTI classification, even though relatively few patients switched their assigned diagnosis. It is likely that the integrated classification approach will prove even more valuable in settings where the host signature may not perform as well on its own (e.g., immune-compromised patients) and will generalize better to future cohorts. Moreover, it provides clinicians with a unified framework both for LRTI diagnosis and etiologic pathogen identification.</p><p>Unlike for host gene expression, the microbial features in the integrated classifier were not automatically selected by training on identified taxa and their features in the Definite and No Evidence groups. Such an approach was not feasible given the sparse presence of individual respiratory pathogens across patients in the cohort, especially in the No Evidence group. As larger data sets are generated, it may be possible to use machine-learning approaches to capture the &#8220;null distribution&#8221; of incidentally carried pathogens in the lower respiratory tract and identify outlier cases that signal LRTI. Even then, designating a specific microbe as a &#8220;true&#8221; causal pathogen for training purposes would be nontrivial, especially in cases of coinfection. Instead, we defined summary viral and bacterial scores motivated by accumulated clinical and microbiologic knowledge. For bacteria and fungi, we took advantage of the collapse of lung microbiome diversity in the setting of pathogen dominance, an established feature of LRTI (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of mNGS and clinical microbiologic testing was complicated by inherent differences in the anatomical site of testing (upper respiratory viral PCR vs. lower respiratory mNGS) or the question addressed (growth in culture vs. dominance by mNGS) as well as by heterogeneity in microbiologic practices among study sites. Nevertheless, when clinical testing identified a microbe, it was in most cases present in the mNGS data. A notable exception was adenovirus, which was consistently not found by mNGS when detected by NP swab PCR. This could reflect sensitivity limitations of RNA-Seq for a DNA virus or true absence in the lower airway. Our secondary analysis revealing higher concordance of PCR and mNGS when performed on the same lower respiratory specimens, however, argues for the latter possibility. Future work could examine targeted enrichment strategies (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) to improve detection of this or any other pathogen that proves challenging to capture by mNGS. Regardless, our findings highlight the value of concomitant assessment of the host response, which can accurately inform LRTI status even when pathogens are not detected.</p><p>A key advantage of mNGS is the capacity to provide a microbiologic diagnosis when traditional clinical testing returns negative, as in an estimated 20%&#8211;60% of suspected community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia cases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Indeed, the integrated mNGS classifier confirmed LRTI in 65% of children with suspected infection but negative clinician-ordered testing in our cohort and in 32% of patients with respiratory failure of indeterminate etiology. It also provided a microbiologic diagnosis in all but one of these patients, highlighting the potential to inform pathogen-targeted versus empirical treatment.</p><p>Acute respiratory illnesses are a leading contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, a practice driven by challenges in distinguishing LRTI from noninfectious causes of respiratory failure or distinguishing bacterial from viral LRTI. Reflecting this is the observation that 90% of children in our cohort received empirical antimicrobials by the time of sample collection, including 84% in the No Evidence group. Host/microbe mNGS offers an opportunity for improved antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in clinically uncertain cases, by providing a probability of infection and by nominating the likely pathogen. In fact, we found that the integrated classifier could be tuned to achieve more than 98% sensitivity for LRTI detection, highlighting its potential use as a rule-out test to help exclude the need for antimicrobials. Moreover, our host gene expression analysis revealed potential for development of a host classifier specifically for bacterial infection.</p><p>Our study has several limitations that should be kept in mind. In developing the mNGS classifiers, we relied on retrospective clinical adjudication for designating the &#8220;ground truth&#8221; LRTI status of patients in the cohort. Retrospective adjudication, which considers the context of patient trajectory and clinical data not available at the time of initial admission, was the only practical approach. However, by nature, it is not infallible and was subject to variability in clinical and microbiologic practices across study sites and to the known limitations of standard microbiologic diagnostics. Moreover, comprehensive microbiologic testing was not always performed in the No Evidence group in the absence of clinical suspicion of LRTI, which likely allowed a few patients into this group who were suffering from unrecognized infection on top of their primary diagnosis. It is thus likely that some patients in the No Evidence group deemed LRTI<sup>+</sup> by the mNGS classifier were not truly misclassified, but rather incorrectly adjudicated. Study limitations also include the different age distributions of comparator groups and the relative paucity of purely bacterial infections.</p><p>mNGS provides a broad screen for bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens to overcome the limitations of traditional clinical microbiologic tests. Assays utilizing this technique are already in use in hospitals for microbe detection in typically sterile compartments, such as blood (sepsis) and cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis), with turnaround within 48 hours (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). mNGS promises to improve the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections as well (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) but has not yet seen clinical translation in this area. Respiratory samples present a special challenge because they harbor microbial communities, including potential pathogens, even in states of health. Host gene expression can help distinguish bona fide infection, and several studies have demonstrated the utility of blood transcriptional profiling for this purpose (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, this approach precludes identification of the etiologic respiratory pathogens. Simultaneous analysis of host and microbe in respiratory samples informs both questions, and it is increasingly being applied in studies of the upper and lower airway (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Our work now provides the first, to our knowledge, fully integrated host/microbe LRTI diagnostic classifier from lower airway mNGS, applicable across pathogen types, thus setting the stage for clinical implementation in the relatively near future.</p><p>We envision the approach for LRTI diagnosis by lower airway host/microbe mNGS outlined in this study being used at the time of intubation for critically ill children with acute respiratory failure, as a complement to traditional culture and PCR-based microbiologic testing. Our approach would need to be independently validated and its effect on clinical outcomes would need to be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial before deployment in the hospital. Future work should also examine the trajectory of patient LRTI classification over time, as infection resolves, and how well the classifier might generalize to a similarly large and heterogeneous adult cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study cohort.</title><p>We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated children admitted to 8 pediatric intensive care units in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development&#8217;s Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) from February 2015 to December 2017 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>We enrolled children aged 31 days to 18 years who were expected to require mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube for at least 72 hours.

We applied a variance-stabilizing transformation to the gene counts, as implemented in the R package DESeq2 (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p><p>We implemented a 5-fold cross-validation procedure, such that in each train/test split, we (a) used LASSO logistic regression on the samples in the training folds for feature (gene) selection, (b) trained a random forest classifier on the samples in the training folds using only the selected features, and (c) applied the random forest classifier to the samples in the test fold to obtain an out-of-fold host probability of LRTI. We required at least 9 patients from the No Evidence group in each of the folds to ensure sufficient negative samples in each test set.</p><p>Simple LASSO logistic regression was fit using the cv.glmnet(family=&#8217;binomial&#8217;) function from the R package glmnet (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), leaving all other parameters at their defaults. We used the 1se criterion for selecting the tuning parameter, which picks the sparsest value of the tuning parameter that lies within 1 standard error of the optimum. When evaluating test error, we selected the tuning parameter via nested cross-validation within the training set only.</p><p>Random forest was implemented using the R package randomForest (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We used 10,000 trees and left all parameters at their defaults.</p><p>The AUC for each test fold was calculated using the R package pROC (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) with default behavior. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a predetermined 50% out-of-fold LRTI probability threshold.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of microbes by mNGS and background filtering.</title><p>We processed patient TA samples alongside water controls through the open-source CZ-ID (formerly called IDSeq) metagenomic analysis pipeline (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The pipeline performs subtractive alignment of the human genome and then reference-based alignment of the remaining reads at both the nucleotide and amino acid level against sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide and nonredundant databases, respectively. This is followed by assembly of the reads matching each taxon. Taxa with &#8805;5 read counts in the nucleotide alignment and an average assembly nucleotide alignment &#8805;70 bp were retained for downstream analysis.</p><p>Water controls enabled estimation of the number of background reads expected for each taxon, as previously described (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This was done by modeling the number of background reads as a negative binomial distribution with mean and dispersion fitted on the water controls. For each batch (sequencing run) and taxon, we estimated the mean parameter of the negative binomial distribution by averaging the read counts across the water controls after normalizing by the total nonhost reads, slightly regularizing this estimate by including the global average (across all batches) as an additional sample. We estimated a single dispersion parameter across all taxa and batches using the functions glm.nb() and theta.md() from the R package MASS (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Taxa were then tested for whether they exceeded the count expected from the background distribution, and a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was applied to all tests performed in the same sample. Taxa were considered present in a sample if they achieved an adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Any virus with known ability to cause LRTI, based on a previously conducted literature curation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), that was present in a patient sample after background filtering was considered a probable pathogen.</p></sec><sec><title>RBM.</title><p>For bacteria and fungi that were present after background filtering, we additionally applied the RBM to distinguish potential pathogens from likely commensals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To apply the RBM on each sample, we (a) retained the most abundant bacterial/fungal species from each genus and any less abundant species in the genus that had known ability to cause LRTI, based on a previously conducted literature curation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); (b) ranked all the retained species in the sample by abundance and limited, at most, to the top 15; (c) identified the largest drop in abundance between the ranked species in the sample; and (d) deemed any species above the largest drop in abundance with known ability to cause LRTI as a potential pathogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of microbiome diversity.</title><p>The Shannon diversity index was calculated using either all viral and bacterial taxa, or only bacterial taxa, that were present after background filtering using the R package Vegan (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Two-sided Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni&#8217;s correction were used to evaluate statistical significance of group differences. Tests with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Classification of LRTI status based on integration of host and microbial features.</title><p>For the integrated host/microbe LRTI classifier, we fit a logistic regression model on the following underlying features: (a) the host LRTI probability; (b) the summed abundance, measured in rpM, of any pathogenic viruses present after background filtering (the viral score); and (c) the proportion of any potentially pathogenic bacteria/fungi identified by the RBM of all nonhost read counts (the bacterial score).</p><p>To avoid any leakage from the test set affecting the host probabilities of the training samples in the context of cross-validation, we always used the out-of-bag &#8220;votes&#8221; generated when fitting the host random forest classifier on the training set as the host probabilities of the training samples in the integrated classifier, rather than using their out-of-fold host probabilities. We applied a logistic (log-odds) transformation to the host probabilities:</p><p> (Equation 1)<inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="e1" xlink:role="graphic" xlink:href="jci-133-165904-e207.jpg"/></p><p>To facilitate the transformation, we first slightly regularized the host probabilities and their complementary probabilities away from 0 and 1 by a quantity inversely proportional to the number of random forest trees (<italic toggle="yes">RF<sub>trees</sub></italic> = 10,000):</p><p> (Equation 2)<inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="e2" xlink:role="graphic" xlink:href="jci-133-165904-e208.jpg"/></p><p>For the viral/bacterial scores, we applied a log<sub>10</sub> transformation. In order to avoid taking the log of 0, we added a small uniform quantity to the scores of all the samples, which was calculated by taking the minimum non-zero viral or bacterial score, respectively, in the corresponding training set and dividing it by 10.</p><p>Performance of the integrated classifier was evaluated on the patients in the Definite and No Evidence groups using 5-fold cross-validation, with the same train/test splits and the same per-split host classifiers as in the host-only cross-validation. The AUC for each test fold was calculated using the R package pROC (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) with default behavior. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a predetermined 50% out-of-fold LRTI probability threshold.</p><p>The integrated classifier was then trained on all the patients in the Definite and No Evidence groups and applied to the patients in the Suspected and Indeterminate groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Data and code availability.</title><p>Raw FASTQ files are protected due to patient privacy concerns.
