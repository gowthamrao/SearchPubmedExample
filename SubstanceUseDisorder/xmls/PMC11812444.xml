To our knowledge, we report the first case of dural graft breakdown following posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty.</p><sec><title>Illustrative Case</title><sec><title>History and Presentations</title><p>A patient presented to the neurosurgery clinic at 12 years of age for the evaluation of a CM-I initially noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed as part of a workup for intermittent but progressive difficulties with coordination in the context of sensorineural hearing loss since age 4 years, despite a normal newborn hearing screen. At this time, the patient described episodic occipital headaches during periods of vigorous exercise but denied exacerbation with tussive maneuvers. A neurologist also evaluated the patient for bilateral numbness and paresthesia of her lower extremities, which extended from her ankles to the hallux and sole of the medial foot. She denied any other motor or sensory symptoms, with no abnormal findings on physical examination.</p><p>MRI of the brain and cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine performed without intravenous contrast showed a descent of the cerebellar tonsils approximately 6&#8211;7 mm below the foramen magnum with associated crowding. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies of her bilateral lower extremities revealed no abnormalities.</p><p>Elective operative intervention was recommended, and the patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy with a C1 laminectomy and expansive duraplasty. The craniectomy was 3 cm &#215; 3 cm in length with a Y-shaped dural opening. Outflow to the fourth ventricle was visualized with separation of the cerebellar tonsils. Duraplasty was performed by circumferentially suturing DuraMatrix Suturable (Collagen Matrix, Inc.) to the dura. A CSF leak was not noted on Valsalva maneuvers, and the dural repair was covered with Adherus dural sealant (HyperBranch Medical Technology, Inc.).</p><p>The patient&#8217;s postoperative course was uncomplicated. Non&#8211;contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain with the cine flow protocol on postoperative day 2 showed expected postoperative changes, with adequate decompression of the foramen magnum and improved flow dorsal to the cerebellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Follow-up MRI at 2 months demonstrated stable findings with an unchanged 3 &#215; 3 &#215; 5&#8211;cm asymptomatic fluid collection within the dorsal subcutaneous tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).

However, 6 months postoperatively, she described a recurrence of her exercise-induced headaches with decreased severity but stable frequency as compared to her preoperative symptoms. Given concerns for her recurrent symptoms, brain MRI with and without contrast was performed, showing a decrease in the size of the posterior fluid collection, which now measured 1.3 &#215; 2.6 &#215; 4.5 cm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). No syrinx was noted in the cervical spine. The patient was advised to follow up with the neurology service for additional evaluation but was subsequently lost to follow-up.

She described these as diffusely frontal with pressure behind the eyes, which worsened when she lay flat. She reported that these were different from her prior occipital headaches. Neurological examination findings were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cervical spine before this visit was significant for a pseudomeningocele measuring 3.7 &#215; 0.8 &#215; 0.8 cm with an associated dural defect not present on previous studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Given concerns for a possible infectious etiology versus intracranial hypotension (the latter given her positional symptoms), contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance venography studies of the brain were performed. The magnetic resonance venogram showed slight prominence of the venous sinuses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), with no additional findings noted on MRI of the brain. It was hypothesized that the patient was experiencing low-pressure headaches given the dural defect, and the decision was made to proceed with an exploration and revision of her duraplasty.

The free edges of the previous dural patch were carefully dissected, revealing a well-demarcated dural defect, approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, in the center of the prior duraplasty. CSF egress was noted, but the defect was not in contact with peripheral suture lines.</p><p>Pericranium autografting was performed to repair the defect with a 2 &#215; 2&#8211;cm piece of pericranium harvested along the left lateral occipital convexity. The dural defect was repaired with this autograft using circumferential running CV-6 GORE-TEX sutures (W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc.). Mild CSF leakage was observed at the suture line, so an EVARREST fibrin sealant patch (Ethicon Inc.) was applied to reinforce the repair, followed by a layer of Adherus dural sealant spray. Closure was performed in layers: the suboccipital and paraspinal muscles, as well as the dorsal cervical fascia, were closed with 0 Vicryl sutures (Ethicon Inc.). The deep dermal layer was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures, and a running 3-0 Monocryl suture was used for the skin.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Course</title><p>The patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit postoperatively, downgraded to intermediate care on postoperative day 1, and discharged on postoperative day 3.

The patient was evaluated in the clinic in 1 month and described improvement in her preoperative headaches but noted dysesthetic pain in the right parietal scalp, which extended down through her incision. She was prescribed gabapentin 100 mg to be taken three times daily and was advised to follow up in 3 months with brain and cervical spine constructive interference in steady state (CISS) MRI and cine flow protocol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).
