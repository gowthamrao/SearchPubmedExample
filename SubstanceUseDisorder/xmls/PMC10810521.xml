Globally, CS is the most common major surgical intervention in pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), CS rate between 10&#8211;15% is considered optimum at the population level. Globally, the reported rate of CS is 21.1% and varies between 4.1% in West and Central Africa and 44.3% in the Latin America and the Caribbean region and increasing by 4% annually [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286165.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In India, the overall CS rate has increased from 8.5% to 21.5% in the last 15 years [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to the last national-level survey, a substantial variation exists between the states- from as low as 5.2% in Nagaland to as high as 60.7% in Telangana [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>As a surgical procedure, caesarean delivery may be accompanied by several complications including surgical site infections (SSI) [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SSIs increase the morbidity and mortality of the mothers and babies and increases the length of hospital stay and thereby the cost of care [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286165.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To prevent SSI, the WHO recommend using a single dose antibiotic, mostly the first generation cephalosporins or pencillin before 30 to minutes of incision for all women undergoing CS [<xref rid="pone.0286165.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>According to reports, the incidence of post-CS SSI worldwide is between 0.63% and 9.85%.

Prior to 2017, the hospital&#8217;s practice involved administering post-operative antibiotics to all patients undergoing a caesarean section (CS). However, after adapting the single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis, the administration of post-operative antibiotics was limited to cases where there was clinical or microbiological evidence of infection, specifically in cases of surgical site infections (SSI&#8217;s). Additionally, we looked at the risk factors of SSI and reported the bacteriological profiles and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the culture positive isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting</title><p>The study was carried out at MediCiti Institute of Medical Sciences which is a tertiary care teaching hospital at Ghanpur village, located about 25km from the city of Hyderabad, in the Indian state of Telangana.

An emergency CS is where there is either maternal or foetal compromise or where there is immediate threat to the life of women or foetus.

Post-discharge, the information on signs and symptoms were also collected by weekly telephone calls till the end of 30<sup>th</sup> day from the date of operation by the study nurse.

If growth was seen after 24hrs, standard biochemical reactions were performed to isolate the organism.

Unpaired t-test was applied to test the difference in mean between two groups whereas association between two categorical variables was found out using chi-square test.

A single dose of prophylactic antibiotic, injection cefazolin was given and if not available, injection cefotaxime was given 30 minutes to one hour before skin incision for both elective and emergency caesarean sections.

Please use the word &#8216;susceptibility&#8217; instead of &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Page 2, Line 49: &#8220;Of these, 92 participants&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p><p>Comment: Delete &#8216;Of these&#8217; and start the sentence with &#8217;Ninety-two participants&#8217;.</p><p>Page 2-3, Lines 54-55: &#8220;Microbial growth was observed in 75.8% 3 55 (n=50/66) samples&#8221;</p><p>Comment: Please rephrase the above sentence like &#8220;Microbial growth in culture was observed from 55 (75.8%) out of total 66 samples&#8221;. Please mention the statistical figures in and out of the parentheses within a sentence uniformly throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Page 3, Lines 55-56: The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus 56 (n=23, 46.0%), Klebsiella sp. (n=13, 26.0%), and Escherichia coli (n=12, 24.0%).</p><p>Comment: From the above sentence, it appears to be that the percentages of the organisms were calculated considering the total number of samples with a positive growth as denominator. Since multiple organisms have been isolated from 7 samples (as mentioned under Results), it will be helpful if the percentages are calculated considering total number of isolates in the denominator. Please also make relevant changes in the text under &#8216;Results&#8217; section.</p><p>Page 3, Lines 58-61: Conclusion: Given the low rate of SSI following Caesarean deliveries subjected to single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis and the increased risk noted with obesity, it is rationale to practice the latest recommendations of WHO including higher dose for obese patients, unless there is compelling evidence to do otherwise in any context.</p><p>Comment: It is strongly advisable that the author should rewrite the conclusion of both Abstract and the main text based on the objective of the study only i.e. rate of CS and significant risk factors. Any recommendation based on the findings, may be included under the Discussion only.</p><p>Page 4, Lines 83-84: To prevent SSI, the WHO recommend using a single dose antibiotic, mostly the first generation cephalosporins, before 30 to minutes of incision for all women undergoing CS.</p><p>Comment: As per the reference cited, the recommendation for as single dose antibiotics is first generation cephalosporins or penicillin. Authors are advised to recheck the same and make required changes.</p><p>Page 5, Lines 107: We classified CS into two types- emergency and elective.</p><p>Comment: In general, emergency procedures have more risk for post-operative infections than elective procedures. As more than 60% of the patients underwent emergency CS it will be better if some comparative analysis is done based on the parameters described in the manuscript between emergency and elective CS.</p><p>Page 5, Line 113: For estimating 2% or less incidence of SSI after CS</p><p>Comment: Please clarify on the incidence of SSI after CS for calculating sample size. Or cite suitable reference.</p><p>Page 5, Lines 116-119: When Cefazolin was unavailable, injection Ampicillin 1 gram, OR injection Cefotaxim 1 gram was given.</p><p>Comment: Check the spelling of antibiotics. Few are written wrongly in the manuscript. Within a sentence, the name of the antibiotics should be written in lower case letters only.</p><p>As per the above-mentioned sentence, a third generation of cephalosporin was sometimes chosen if cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, was not available. Is this also a part of hospital&#8217;s antibiotic policy?</p><p>Also mention under discussion why choosing a higher generation cephalosporins instead of first generation cephalosporins only will not cause any difference in rate of SSI in the study.</p><p>Page 6, Lines 121-124: Definition of variables: SSI was defined as- "An infection of the superficial or deep skin incision, or of an organ or space, occurring up to 30 days after surgery.&#8221; [17] There are two types of SSI- superficial and deep. As per the CDC definition, "A superficial SSI is infection identified during hospital stay or within 30 days&#8230;&#8230;..</p><p>Comment: It is not clear what exact criteria were adopted for defining SSI. From the later sentences of the above paragraph, it seems to be that the authors have adopted CDC surveillance definitions. If NHSN-CDC surveillance definitions were considered to define the cases in the study, that should be directly cited as reference. Moreover, considering the detailed nature of the definitions of the guidelines it should be enough to state that &#8220;SSI for the present study was defined as per the CDC-NHSN guidelines&#8221;.</p><p>Page 7, Lines 150-151:&#160; Data collection: All pertinent clinical details were collected by from the participants hospital record using structured questionnaire by a dedicated study nurse.</p><p>Comment: Please upload the structured questionnaire as supplementary file. Please also mention about the source of the questionnaire under the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section.</p><p>Page 7, Lines 152-171: The hospital policy was to discharge the patient after suture removal&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. microbiological procedure was followed for those who were discharged and followed up in the OPD.</p><p>Comment: Please provide some headings for the above paragraphs like &#8220;Laboratory diagnosis of SSI&#8221;, &#8220;Post-discharge Follow up&#8221;.</p><p>Page 10, Lines 200-202: The average hospital stay was 11.8 days (SD 3.7 days) in women who developed SSI and 9.3 (SD 3.1) days without SSI and mean difference was 2.5 days (95% CI: 1.9 to 3.2 days; p &lt;0.001).</p><p>Comment: Please indicate under Statistical Methods in the Methods section about the specific test that was used for comparing the continuous quantitative variables.</p><p>Page 11, Lines 215-216: The only gram-positive organism, Staphylococcus, was commonly sensitive to- Linezolid (20 isolates, 87%)&#8230;.</p><p>Comment: Authors need to recheck and confirm the susceptibility profile of staphylococcal isolates against linezolid. Linezolid resistance in Staphylococcus is still very low in India. No speciation has also been done for Staphylococcus. Please differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in the manuscript.</p><p>Page 12, Lines 221-222: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. and Cefepime (9 isolates, 69.2%) and commonly resistant to Ampicillin (11 isolates, 222 84.6%) and Amoxycillin/Clavulanic acid combination (10 isolates, 76.9%).</p><p>Comment: It seems to be that the intrinsic resistance was not considered for some of the organisms in the study. Those with intrinsic resistance against some particular organism, need not to be analysed for resistance/susceptibility profile against that particular organisms. Authors are strongly encouraged to seek help from clinical microbiologists or ID specialists for these technical issues.</p><p>Page 16, Lines 246-247: Therefore, we recommend adherence to the guidelines unless there is evidence-based justification to deviate from them.</p><p>Comment: The statement may be overly correct, as the authors themselves did not uniformly followed the WHO guidelines (choice of antibiotics) for all the subjects.</p><p>Page 17, Lines 262-263: The finding is consistent with the findings from other Indian studies which has reported mixed infections with gram negative and gram-positive organisms. [14&#8211;16,20]</p><p>Comment: The authors should rephrase the above sentence as mixed infections term may be misleading and often refers to co-infections by both types of organisms mentioned above.</p><p>Page 17, Lines 266-267: Another strength of this study is that the proforma was filled by study nurses only, to rule out reporting bias.</p><p>Comment: Authors should also mention about the questionnaire filled up by the nurses under the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Comment: Please define anaemia (as per Hb% etc) and hypertension (SBP, DBP, etc) within the table.</p><p>Table 2</p><p>Comment: Please mention the p values for individual variables with regards to the multivariable analysis. It&#8217;s also not clear whether authors choose to perform multivariable analysis for those variables which had a significant value in univariate analysis. Please clarify under the Statistical Methods</p><p>Tables&#160;3 and 4</p><p>Comment: Both the tables may not be required. Either resistance or susceptibility profile may be presented. Moreover, the colour coding of the cells seem arbitrary without mentioning the level of susceptibility/resistance. Authors should remake the tables with mentioning of percentages instead of absolute numbers. Please seek help from a clinical microbiologist for depicting the susceptibility profile. Name of the organisms should be properly written following standard nomenclature.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

Please use the word &#8216;susceptibility&#8217; instead of &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Response: Agree with the suggestion, replaced with the word &#8216; susceptibility&#8217;.</p><p>Page 2, Line 49: &#8220;Of these, 92 participants&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p><p>Comment: Delete &#8216;Of these&#8217; and start the sentence with &#8217;Ninety-two participants&#8217;.</p><p>Response: Agree with the suggestion , changed.</p><p>Page 2-3, Lines 54-55: &#8220;Microbial growth was observed in 75.8% 3 55 (n=50/66) samples&#8221;</p><p>Comment: Please rephrase the above sentence like &#8220;Microbial growth in culture was observed from 55 (75.8%) out of total 66 samples&#8221;. Please mention the statistical figures in and out of the parentheses within a sentence uniformly throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Response: As suggested by the reviewers,the sentence was rephrased. The statistical figures were mentioned uniformly throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Page 3, Lines 55-56: The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus 56 (n=23, 46.0%), Klebsiella sp. (n=13, 26.0%), and Escherichia coli (n=12, 24.0%).</p><p>Comment: From the above sentence, it appears to be that the percentages of the organisms were calculated considering the total number of samples with a positive growth as denominator. Since multiple organisms have been isolated from 7 samples (as mentioned under Results), it will be helpful if the percentages are calculated considering total number of isolates in the denominator. Please also make relevant changes in the text under &#8216;Results&#8217; section</p><p>Response: Thanks for the suggestion. We have done the calculation accordingly. Also, as suggested by the other reviewer, we have also reported the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and number of Coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolates. </p><p>Page 3, Lines 58-61: Conclusion: Given the low rate of SSI following Caesarean deliveries subjected to single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis and the increased risk noted with obesity, it is rationale to practice the latest recommendations of WHO including higher dose for obese patients, unless there is compelling evidence to do otherwise in any context.</p><p>Comment: It is strongly advisable that the author should rewrite the conclusion of both Abstract and the main text based on the objective of the study only i.e. rate of CS and significant risk factors. Any recommendation based on the findings, may be included under the Discussion only.</p><p>Response: As suggested, conclusion was changed.</p><p>Page 4, Lines 83-84: To prevent SSI, the WHO recommend using a single dose antibiotic, mostly the first generation cephalosporins, before 30 to minutes of incision for all women undergoing CS.</p><p>Comment: As per the reference cited, the recommendation for as single dose antibiotics is first generation cephalosporins or penicillin. Authors are advised to recheck the same and make required changes</p><p>Response: Rechecked the reference no.8. Changes made</p><p>Page 5, Lines 107: We classified CS into two types- emergency and elective.</p><p>Comment: In general, emergency procedures have more risk for post-operative infections than elective procedures. As more than 60% of the patients underwent emergency CS it will be better if some comparative analysis is done based on the parameters described in the manuscript between emergency and elective CS</p><p>Response: As advised by the reviewers, comparative analysis was done between elective and emergency CS</p><p>Page 5, Line 113: For estimating 2% or less incidence of SSI after CS</p><p>Comment: Please clarify on the incidence of SSI after CS for calculating sample size. Or cite suitable reference.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. According to the study conducted by Vijayan et al (2016), we determined that a minimum sample size of approximately 1500 women undergoing caesarean section would be necessary to estimate a 4.1% incidence of surgical site infections (SSI). This estimation took into account a significance level (&#945;) of 0.05, a power (&#946;) of 0.8, and a margin of error of 0.01.</p><p>Reference: Vijayan CP, Mohandas S, Nath AG, Surgical site infection following caesarean section in a teaching hospital. International Journal of Scientific Study. 2016;3(12);97-101.</p><p>Page 5, Lines 116-119: When Cefazolin was unavailable, injection Ampicillin 1 gram, OR injection Cefotaxim 1 gram was given.</p><p>Comment: Check the spelling of antibiotics. Few are written wrongly in the manuscript. Within a sentence, the name of the antibiotics should be written in lower case letters only.</p><p>As per the above-mentioned sentence, a third generation of cephalosporin was sometimes chosen if cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, was not available. Is this also a part of hospital&#8217;s antibiotic policy?</p><p>Also mention under discussion why choosing a higher generation cephalosporins instead of first generation cephalosporins only will not cause any difference in rate of SSI in the study.</p><p>Response: Spelling of cefotaxime changed. Yes, it is the hospital policy to use third generation cephalosporin if first generation of cephalosporin was not available.</p><p>Page 6, Lines 121-124: Definition of variables: SSI was defined as- "An infection of the superficial or deep skin incision, or of an organ or space, occurring up to 30 days after surgery.&#8221; [17] There are two types of SSI- superficial and deep. As per the CDC definition, "A superficial SSI is infection identified during hospital stay or within 30 days&#8230;&#8230;..</p><p>Comment: It is not clear what exact criteria were adopted for defining SSI. From the later sentences of the above paragraph, it seems to be that the authors have adopted CDC surveillance definitions. If NHSN-CDC surveillance definitions were considered to define the cases in the study, that should be directly cited as reference. Moreover, considering the detailed nature of the definitions of the guidelines it should be enough to state that &#8220;SSI for the present study was defined as per the CDC-NHSN guidelines&#8221;.</p><p>Response: As suggested , definition of SSI was changed accordingly, reference given</p><p>Page 7, Lines 150-151: Data collection: All pertinent clinical details were collected by from the participants hospital record using structured questionnaire by a dedicated study nurse.</p><p>Comment: Please upload the structured questionnaire as supplementary file. Please also mention about the source of the questionnaire under the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section.</p><p>Response: The questionnaire was uploaded as supplementary file.</p><p>Page 7, Lines 152-171: The hospital policy was to discharge the patient after suture removal&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. microbiological procedure was followed for those who were discharged and followed up in the OPD.</p><p>Comment: Please provide some headings for the above paragraphs like &#8220;Laboratory diagnosis of SSI&#8221;, &#8220;Post-discharge Follow up&#8221;.</p><p>Response: As advised by the reviewers, headings were provided.</p><p>Page 10, Lines 200-202: The average hospital stay was 11.8 days (SD 3.7 days) in women who developed SSI and 9.3 (SD 3.1) days without SSI and mean difference was 2.5 days (95% CI: 1.9 to 3.2 days; p &lt;0.001).</p><p>Comment: Please indicate under Statistical Methods in the Methods section about the specific test that was used for comparing the continuous quantitative variables.</p><p>Response: We agree with the reviewers. As suggested, mentioned in the statistical methods</p><p>Page 11, Lines 215-216: The only gram-positive organism, Staphylococcus, was commonly sensitive to- Linezolid (20 isolates, 87%)&#8230;.</p><p>Comment: Authors need to recheck and confirm the susceptibility profile of staphylococcal isolates against linezolid. Linezolid resistance in Staphylococcus is still very low in India. No speciation has also been done for Staphylococcus. Please differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in the manuscript.</p><p>Response: We thank the author for the comment. We have discussed the same with the clinical Microbiologist and reanalyzed the figures. There were 7 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and we have reported the sensitivity and resistance based on these 7 isolates. We have differentiated between the two organisms, viz. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus.</p><p>Page 12, Lines 221-222: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. and Cefepime (9 isolates, 69.2%) and commonly resistant to Ampicillin (11 isolates, 222 84.6%) and Amoxycillin/Clavulanic acid combination (10 isolates, 76.9%).</p><p>Comment: It seems to be that the intrinsic resistance was not considered for some of the organisms in the study. Those with intrinsic resistance against some particular organism, need not to be analysed for resistance/susceptibility profile against that particular organisms. Authors are strongly encouraged to seek help from clinical microbiologists or ID specialists for these technical issues</p><p>Response: We have discussed with the Clinical Microbiologist and considered the intrinsic resistance and removed those antibiotics. We have merged table 3 and table 4 as suggested by the other reviewers also. </p><p>Page 16, Lines 246-247: Therefore, we recommend adherence to the guidelines unless there is evidence-based justification to deviate from them.</p><p>Comment: The statement may be overly correct, as the authors themselves did not uniformly followed the WHO guidelines (choice of antibiotics) for all the subjects.</p><p>Response: Yes. We understand that and we have reported that practicality to avoid any biased statement. </p><p>Page 17, Lines 262-263: The finding is consistent with the findings from other Indian studies which has reported mixed infections with gram negative and gram-positive organisms. [14&#8211;16,20]</p><p>Comment: The authors should rephrase the above sentence as mixed infections term may be misleading and often refers to co-infections by both types of organisms mentioned above</p><p>Response: The sentence has been rephrased.</p><p>Page 17, Lines 266-267: Another strength of this study is that the proforma was filled by study nurses only, to rule out reporting bias.</p><p>Comment: Authors should also mention about the questionnaire filled up by the nurses under the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section</p><p>Response: As suggested by the reviewers , mentioned under the &#8216;Methods&#8217; section</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0286165.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0286165.s004.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0286165.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0286165.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Das</surname><given-names initials="A">Arghya</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2024 Arghya Das</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2024</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Arghya Das</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0286165"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>Responses to the reviewer&#8217;s comments</p><p>Editors comment:</p><p>1. The exponentiated coefficients for logistic regression model are interpreted as odds ratios whereas for log-binomial regression they are relative risk ratios. The authors have mentioned that they have conducted logistic regression but mentioned relative risks instead of odds ratio. This needs clarification.</p><p>Response: We thank the editor for pointing it out. We have revised the terminology used from &#8216;logistic regression&#8217; to &#8216;binomial regression&#8221;. Vide line number 174-176.</p><p>Editors comment: </p><p>2. Please edit the title of the manuscript while resubmission and delete "Dear Editor".</p><p>Response: Thanks. We will ensure that while resubmitting the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewers # 3 comments</p><p>3. The statistical analysis is not in accordance with the research question. The research question is whether there is a reduction in the SSI following single antibiotic prophylaxis but the analysis is on various risk factors rather.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. Please note that our primary objective was- to determine the incidence of post CS SSI following the adoption of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis as recommended by WHO [8] in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Medchal, Telangana state, India. (Vide- line number 93-95).</p><p>Besides, we had two more secondary objectives- &#8220;Additionally, we looked at the risk factors of SSI and reported the bacteriological profiles and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the culture positive isolates.&#8221; (Vide line number 99-101)</p><p>In our results, we have articulated the results in the same line- the incidence of SSI, the risk factors and the susceptibility pattern of the culture positive isolates. </p><p>All the authors have gone through the results and we strongly feel that the statistical analysis is in accordance with the research objectives.</p><p>4. The study variables are not well defined.</p><p>Response: We have added the definitions of all other variables those were missed out in the previous draft with appropriate references. (Vide line number 139 to 145). Please note that we have revised the sequence of references as well while incorporating the additional references.</p><p>5. The study population is not homogenous which includes both elective and emergency caesarean section group.</p><p>Response: We thank the author for the comment. Please note that in a hospital setting, we expect both elective and emergency caesarean section group. Hence, we believe that the population is homogeneous. In addition, we strongly feel that type of surgery may be directly related to SSI. Hence, we have reported the primary outcome of interest (SSI incidence) separately for both these groups to ensure clarity in the results.</p><p>6. The elective section group included by the author also has patients in prolonged labour which is incorrect.</p><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer and we have done the necessary correction in table 3.</p><p>7. There is no comparator group. The institute's previous SSI at least should be mentioned.</p><p>Response: As our primary outcome was to calculate the SSI incidence, we did not require a comparator group. Also, taking a historical control has it&#8217;s own challenges, especially the robustness of the information. Hence, we feel that taking a comparator group might not help improving the interpretation of the present finding. However, to calculate the risk, we have used the comparator group.</p><p>Reviewers #4 comment</p><p>8. It seems that these lines depicting resistance/susceptibility profile of Ampicillin in Klebsiella species has not been modified as suggested by other reviewers. Authors are suggested to check the intrinsic resistance profile of Klebsiella species and accordingly make changes in the manuscript.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing it out. Comment of the earlier reviewer was &#8220;It seems to be that the intrinsic resistance was not considered for some of the organisms in the study. Those with intrinsic resistance against some particular organism, need not to be analysed for resistance/susceptibility profile against that particular organisms. Authors are strongly encouraged to seek help from clinical microbiologists or ID specialists for these technical issues.&#8221; </p><p>Though we changed mostly based on the comment, we might have missed a few inadvertently. We have now incorporated the changes as suggested after discussing with the clinical microbiologist. The changes are as follows: </p><p>&#8226; The ampicillin resistance pattern for Klebsiella has been removed from the table and from the text.

Labouring patients are included in the elective section group in the table</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We have gone through the data source carefully and learned that an inadvertent error took place from our end , and we misclassified a few participants as elective section group, whereas, they should have been included in the emergency CS group. Hence, we have updated the data and reanalyzed it and updated the results and the discussion section as per the need. We have also replaced the previous data that we submitted to PLOS One with the updated data.</p><p>2. Grammatical and punctuation errors needs to be corrected</p><p> Response: Thank you the reviewer for pointing out. We have addressed them.</p><p>3.
