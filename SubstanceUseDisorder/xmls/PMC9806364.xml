antimicrobials related to injection drug use have risen sharply over the
last decade. At our rural tertiary care center, opportunities for treatment
of underlying substance use disorders were often missed during these
hospital admissions. Once medically stable, home IV antimicrobial therapy
has not traditionally been offered to this patient population due to
theoretical concerns about misuse of long-term IV catheters, leading to
discharges with suboptimal treatment regimens, lengthy hospital stays, or
care that is incongruent with patient goals and preferences.</p></sec><sec id="section2-20499361221142476"><title>Methods:</title><p>A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and patients set out to redesign and
improve care for this patient population through a health care innovation
process, with a focus on increasing the proportion of patients who may be
discharged on home IV therapy. Baseline assessment of current experience was
established through retrospective chart review and extensive stakeholder
analysis. The innovation process was based in design thinking and
facilitated by a health care delivery improvement incubator.</p></sec><sec id="section3-20499361221142476"><title>Results:</title><p>The components of the resulting intervention included early identification of
hospitalized people who inject drugs with serious infections, a proactive
psychiatry consultation service for addiction management for all patients, a
multidisciplinary care conference to support decision making around
treatment options for infection and substance use, and care
coordination/navigation in the outpatient setting with a substance use peer
recovery coach and infectious disease nurse for patients discharged on home
IV antimicrobials. Patients discharged on home IV therapy followed routine
outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) protocols and treatment
protocols for addiction with their chosen provider.</p></sec><sec id="section4-20499361221142476"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>An intervention developed through a design-thinking-based health care
redesign process improved patient-centered care for people with serious

hospitalizations for serious infections attributable to injection drug use
(IDU).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The standard of care for adult patients with serious infections
such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis resulting from IDU typically involves
extended courses of intravenous (IV) antimicrobial therapy, on the order of six or
more weeks. People who inject drugs (PWID) have traditionally been excluded from
entry into outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) programs because of
theoretical concerns about misuse of long-term venous access catheters needed in the
outpatient setting, with associated assumed risks of overdose or additional
infection.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The exclusion of PWID from OPAT programs leads to prolonged hospitalizations after
the patient is medically stable, as well as self-directed discharge (SDD), with
patients leaving the hospital on suboptimal treatment regimens. These experiences
create disruption and dissatisfaction for the patient and hospital staff. Lengthy
hospitalizations are also costly<sup><xref rid="bibr4-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and can be problematic for
patients who have work or childcare commitments. Furthermore, in areas that may have
hospital capacity issues, long hospitalizations can exacerbate bed shortages,
decreasing availability for other patients in need. In addition, after a SDD when
robust discharge planning may not be possible, outpatient providers and clinic staff
often spend significant time and resources trying to track down patients to continue
care.</p><p>Hospitalization offers a unique window to address substance use disorders (SUDs), but
unfortunately, too often this opportunity is missed.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Inadequate attention to the
underlying SUD may contribute to behavioral problems during hospitalization
resulting in tension, safety problems, burnout for staff,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and disproportionate time spent
with PWID in relation to others on the unit. Failure to secure appropriate addiction
treatment when patients transition to the outpatient setting leaves patients at high
risk of relapse of their addiction, infection, readmission, and death, while
starting medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the hospital and linking
patients directly to care has been shown to be more effective at engaging patients
after discharge than detoxification and referral.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, patients who have infections secondary to IDU often have prolonged
hospitalizations that are costly, exacerbate bed shortages, and are not aligned with
patient preferences. Several institutions have begun to attempt use of OPAT in this
population with success.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr"/></sup>&#8211;<sup><xref rid="bibr16-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> To better meet the needs of
these patients who are frequently admitted to our hospital,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> we used a
health care quality improvement approach informed by design thinking. Our goals were
to individualize care with a more patient-centered approach, to prioritize discharge
home on OPAT when possible, and to address SUDs during the hospitalization as well
as secure SUD treatment in the outpatient setting. This manuscript explores that
process and describes the resulting care delivery model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-20499361221142476"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-20499361221142476"><title>Setting</title><p>This work took place at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), a 396-bed
tertiary care teaching hospital in Lebanon, New Hampshire (NH), which serves a

devoted at least 4&#8201;hour per week over 12&#8201;months to the project, with
clinician time being supported by the incubator program. Given that the
voices of PWID are often marginalized within the health care system, a
design-thinking approach seemed ideal for ensuring we incorporated patient
perspectives into redesign plans and approaches. By actively seeking out
these perspectives throughout through both patient stakeholder interviews

processes at DHMC for PWID with serious infections and analyzing root causes
for identified problem areas. We did this in multiple ways. First, to
confirm our anecdotal experience around problematic elements in care of this
population at the institution, we queried the EHR for hospital admissions
for serious infections (any infection which traditionally requires greater
than 7&#8201;days of IV antimicrobial therapy, such as endocarditis, bacteremia,
osteomyelitis, and deep-seated abscesses) among PWID from February 2019
through February 2020. These dates were chosen because it was the most
recent year before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic, which we
had observed skewed hospital admission volume for all infections. Chart
review was performed to gather data about care received while hospitalized
related to both infection and SUD(s), as well as general demographic data
and hospital quality measures.</p><p>Second, to better define the problem, we built a detailed flow map of the
baseline process for management of these patients. The baseline map
highlighted two main logistical challenges that could be anticipated in
attempts to improve care for this population. First, the lack of a clear
system to identify PWID with serious infections early during their
hospitalization impeded timely evaluation by appropriate teams, in
particular, ID and BIT. Second, communication between multiple teams of
providers was cumbersome, creating challenges for care coordination. The
flow map further highlighted that a single clinician was usually responsible
for a decision about appropriate options for continued infection treatment
when the patient became medically stable. This individual was the ID
attending physician, who alone did not usually have all information (such as
full knowledge of the patient&#8217;s social situation) and expertise (such as
training in psychiatry or addiction medicine) needed to make a decision
about risks of home IV therapy. Finally, there was no clear step in care
where referral for outpatient addiction treatment was ensured.</p></sec><sec id="section11-20499361221142476"><title>Stakeholder interviews</title><p>The flow map identified groups of stakeholders at each step. The stakeholder
groups are outlined in <xref rid="table2-20499361221142476" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. We then identified individuals from each group for
interviews. Project team members in some cases were considered stakeholders
for this purpose. Outside of the project team, for groups at DHMC, leaders
in each clinical area were approached for interviews, and the leader either
engaged with the interview or assigned a team member to be interviewed. For
organizations outside of DHMC, in most cases, we similarly had known
leadership contacts with whom we connected, who either spoke to us
themselves or referred us to their team members. In instances of addiction
treatment facilities where we did not have a known contact, a call was made
to their administrative staff with the request for an interview with the
appropriate party. To identify patients, a chart review of recent admissions
of patients treated for infections related to IDU was completed by the
psychiatrist on the project team to identify appropriate stakeholders.
Patients were contacted using the contact information available in the EHR,
and those who agreed to participate were interviewed by the psychiatrist or
a peer recovery coach. Families of patients were also included when
possible.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="table2-20499361221142476" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Stakeholders.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="10.1177_20499361221142476-table2.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stakeholder departments and teams</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Addiction Treatment Program (ATP), Psychiatry

all parties expressed dissatisfaction with the existing state. Care Management
and hospital leadership expressed difficulties around long hospitalizations
reducing access to care for other patients. Medical care providers shared
frustrations with regard to inability to consistently provide standard of care
treatment, as well as frustration around behavioral issues when patients remain
admitted for long IV antibiotic courses. Providers also discussed uncertainties
about decision making based on lack of knowledge about all aspects of the
patient&#8217;s care; for example, ID physicians commented that they are often
uncertain about how to evaluate and manage the patient&#8217;s SUD, and how to think
about this in the context of overall options for care. Providers, nurses, and
case managers felt that communication with various care teams to collaborate on
a care plan would be important to decision making in this population, and
development of a clinical care pathway, a method used for a number of other
common conditions at the institution to improve care, was proposed by Care
Managers. Given that the ultimate goal of discharge on home IV therapy would
rely on agreement and engagement with home health agencies, we gave this special
attention during stakeholder interviews, to elicit concerns and needs of health
care workers who would go into patients&#8217; homes. A main concern from home health
providers surrounded lack of sufficient knowledge about addiction and
appropriate interventions if a patient were to be found intoxicated, as well as
liability around use of naloxone.</p><p>Seven patient interviews were completed. All patient participants showed a clear
understanding of the relationship between IDU and infectious complications, and
a receptiveness to addressing SUDs at the time of receiving medical treatment.
No patient expressed concerns that an indwelling long-term IV catheter would
increase risk for substance use. The interviews confirmed the team&#8217;s observation
that prolonged hospital stays caused major disruptions for patients with family
relationships, job responsibilities, and finances. While there was general
acknowledgment that hospitalization was required for parts of medical care to be
completed, a general sense of &#8216;being able to heal better at home&#8217; was related by
most patients. All patients expressed an interest in home OPAT treatment were it
to be appropriate for them.</p><p>Patients repeatedly communicated the need for easy and enhanced communication
with the care team, and favored a single team member who could be identified as
a point person. Communication needs included questions about medical treatment,
but also help in trouble-shooting other care coordination and transportation
needs. Many patients also stated that attending numerous visits at DHMC, if
required after discharge, would be impossible due to living long distances from
the hospital and having unreliable access to transportation.</p></sec><sec id="section16-20499361221142476"><title>Baseline cohort</title><p>Our baseline data included 64 hospitalizations for serious infections among

identified early in their hospital course through collaboration between the BIT
recovery coach and the ID OPAT nursing team, who review their respective patient
consult lists to identify appropriate patients. The OPAT nurse reviews the
inpatient ID consult lists daily because of their duties which include
coordination of home services and patient teaching at discharge. The BIT
recovery coach sees inpatients with SUDs for support and therefore routinely
reviews the list of patients seen by their team.</p><p>This is supported by multiple reports developed through the EHR with the
assistance of the DHMC Analytics group, in addition to BIT&#8217;s existing EHR audit
on some hospital units that identifies patients through nursing administration
of the Drug Abuse Screening Test&#8211;10 (DAST-10) on admission.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Once a
patient is identified with a serious infection and SUD, a secure chat function
is used within the EHR to make appropriate parties aware of the patient and
clinical situation.</p><p>Second, all PWID with serious infections are seen by BIT, specifically including
a peer recovery coach, for assessment of the patient&#8217;s SUD, readiness for
treatment, social situation, likelihood of misusing a long-term IV catheter, as
well as treatment planning both for the inpatient setting and transition to
long-term outpatient treatment with a provider in the community. This represents
a change from the prior practice, in which BIT was variably involved with this
patient population during hospitalizations and did not take primary
responsibility for setting up outpatient transitions of addiction care.</p><p>Third, a multidisciplinary structured care conference was developed, modeled on
experience at other institutions such as the &#8216;OPTIONS-DC&#8217; conference described
by Sikka <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="bibr14-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> at Oregon Health Sciences
University. In our model, this conference is held with all teams involved in the
patient&#8217;s care to discuss the case and develop an individualized plan for both
addiction and infection treatment. This typically includes the primary team, ID
physician, OPAT RN, BIT, Care Management, Social Work, inpatient floor nurse and
supervisor, and clinical liaisons from the hospital&#8217;s affiliated partners for
home infusion services and home health care nursing, New England Life Care
(NELC), and Visiting Nurse and Hospice for New Hampshire and Vermont (VNH),
respectively. The conference is coordinated by the OPAT nurse and BIT recovery
coach.</p><p>At this conference, criteria for candidacy for home IV antibiotics, developed
based on literature review and the diverse experience of our team, are reviewed
(see <xref rid="table4-20499361221142476" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) as a
basis for discussion. A key criterion for candidacy for enrollment in OPAT is
engagement with specific treatment for SUD(s), including MOUD if medically
appropriate, either in the form of methadone, buprenorphine-naloxone, or
buprenorphine extended-release. If medically appropriate, MOUD is required as a
condition of enrollment to OPAT. Outside of this, other appropriate treatment is
defined by BIT clinicians in shared decision making with patients, and may
include individual or group counseling, intensive outpatient or inpatient
rehabilitation. The main outputs of the meeting include a plan for SUD treatment
(including details of the treatment provider and intake) and a shared decision
about candidacy for home IV antibiotic therapy, or, if not a candidate, an
alternate plan for long-term infection treatment. This meeting and plan is
documented as a note in the EHR, similar to documentation for a &#8216;tumor board&#8217;.

long-term IV catheter, typically a peripherally inserted central catheter
(PICC). We do not use a special device on the line to prevent tampering.
Patients then receive education on OPAT, risks of long-term IV catheters, and
harm reduction strategies for both infection (such as sterile injecting supplies
and vein care) and overdose (such as avoidance of using alone and use of
naloxone, which the patient is given before leaving the hospital). They also
sign an agreement acknowledging risks, benefits, and alternatives of enrollment
into OPAT and use of long-term IV catheters, and an agreement allowing ID and
BIT providers to communicate with their outpatient addiction treatment provider.
Once discharged, patients receive enhanced support in the outpatient setting
through regular (at least weekly) phone check-ins with both the BIT recovery
coach and an OPAT RN throughout their course of antibiotics. The recovery coach
and OPAT RN coordinate care and assist the patient with navigation in the health
care system as well as any social issues that arise which may interfere with
care. The OPAT RN communicates with visiting nurse staff at the initiation of
the OPAT course to discuss the case, and initially, a weekly video or phone
check-in between these nurses was also implemented. The patient is followed with
routine OPAT care in the ID clinic, which typically includes a 2-week
post-discharge visit with a provider and a similar visit at the anticipated end
of the therapy. The patient or family administers the antimicrobials. Patients
receive routine weekly visits from the home health nurse, as per usual OPAT
protocols, to change the dressing on the IV line, draw labs, and check in on
symptoms. If problems arise, it is up to the home health nurse to decide if
additional visits are needed. Safety labs, and in appropriate cases,
inflammatory markers, are collected weekly unless the ID provider has a specific
concern and specially orders labs more frequently. We do not collect toxicology
screens as part of the program; this is left to addiction treatment providers if
they feel it is appropriate.</p><p>The BIT recovery coach contacts the outpatient addiction treatment provider if
needed periodically through the antibiotic treatment course. Treatment for the
SUD is managed per usual protocols by the community provider with whom BIT
coordinated to continue care after discharge; this may be through DHMC&#8217;s
Addiction Treatment Program (ATP) or another local provider depending on
availability and the patient&#8217;s preferences, home location, and transportation
situation. The ATP is an outpatient SUD treatment clinic with multiple providers
who serve the local community and beyond with MOUD, counseling, and harm
reduction services. Both BIT and ATP are part of the Department of Psychiatry,
and they directly communicate about mutual patients.</p></sec><sec id="section18-20499361221142476"><title>Lessons learned: iterative implementation</title><p>The project launched in mid-October, 2020. Since that time, we have encountered a
number of challenges in implementation. The plan that was created for early
identification of patients for the care pathway missed several patients, who
were only identified later in their hospital course. As a result, for some
patients, issues around discharge timing made it impossible to go through the
full process for decision making and optimization of care. To address this, we
first modified our EHR reporting system. We then analyzed the process of
identification through value stream mapping to point out problem areas.
Subsequently, we returned to stakeholder discussions and identified that an
existing hospital process of daily interdisciplinary rounds (IDRs), which take
place on each unit, could be leveraged for identification of patients by various
members of the primary team, nursing, or Care Management team. Next, we created
an order within the EHR that the Care Manager enters during the IDR which
triggers notification to the OPAT nursing team that the patient requires review
for potential inclusion in the pathway for PWID with serious infections. This
has improved early patient identification.</p><p>A related problem was coordinating the time of the multidisciplinary conference
to take place far enough in advance of discharge to allow sound decision making
with all needed information at hand as well as the opportunity to set up
outpatient services, but not so far ahead of discharge that the plan would need
to change in the interim. In part, changing the process for early patient
identification was used to help with this timing. However, the team also
modified our initial practice, which was to hold a multidisciplinary conference
on each patient weekly from the time of identification early in the admission
until discharge. This was felt to be too onerous in terms of time by all care
teams and represented another challenge in the overall process, in which
attendance by all teams at conferences was not always consistent. Thus, the
practice was changed to hold the conferences once the patient was expected to
discharge within the next 7&#8201;days (or less if a&#8201;&lt;&#8201;7-day discharge was
expected). This has assisted both with timing and participation in
conferences.</p><p>After discharge, communication has been challenging with both home care providers
and patients. The OPAT nurse originally contacted the home health field nurse
weekly to provide additional support/resources and to assist in the
identification and mitigation of problems as they arose. Upon retrospective
review of the communication between the home health nurse and OPAT nurse, it was
thought that this weekly communication did not provide additional value, while
taking significant time and effort, and so this was abandoned in favor of
development of efficient communication paths that can be utilized by home health
staff on an as-needed basis when a concern arises.</p><p>Communication with patients after discharge met with difficulties around patient
responsiveness. This patient cohort often has various psychosocial factors that
can take priority during their OPAT course; this can hinder the frequency in
which the patient communicates to their medical care team. Several patients were
more responsive and engaged in text message communications than with phone calls
or messages on the electronic patient portal. To address this, we initiated a
practice of proactively identifying multiple methods of reaching patients
through various modalities and pre-approved alternate contacts; we also obtained
a program cell phone with ability for secure text messaging between the recovery
coach and patient. Including this communication option has been beneficial to
check in with patients and provide reminders about upcoming appointments to
encourage their continued engagement in treatment for both their infection and
SUD. An additional barrier to reaching some patients was a lack of access to
phones. We subsequently engaged with the University of Vermont Center on Rural
Addiction (CORA), an organization which is providing mobile phones free of
charge to patients in our program.</p><p>Finally, comfort with recommending OPAT for PWID by health care providers has
been challenging. This is a new and minimally tested practice, and there remains
hesitancy around safety. This hesitancy is expected, and the project itself is
intended to provide further evidence around this practice which may help better
inform decision making in the future. We have already shared some of our initial
safety findings and are planning further education on the topic of treatment
options for PWID with serious infections in the near future to help address this
also.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section19-20499361221142476"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a human-centered design approach, we were able to deeply explore the challenges
around optimal care for PWID with serious infections and redesign this care at our
institution, with the goal of more patient-centered approaches that both
consistently address SUDs and make it possible to promote the use of OPAT in this
population. We carefully considered the perspectives of all involved parties, and in
particular, through the methodology promoted by the incubator process, benefited
from direct input of patients with lived experience both in interviews and on the
project team. We think this element was particularly important given the prevalent
stigma faced by PWID.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The general emphasis on understanding perspectives of all
stakeholders was also crucial when creating a process that included so many
individuals and teams, which is often the case in complex care. With the help of the
incubator staff, we also were able to maximize the expertise of individuals versed
in areas such as medical anthropology and health care system operations, including
institutional leaders who could both guide with &#8216;big picture&#8217; perspectives, and
advocate to break down barriers to change when needed.</p><p>Our intervention intentionally mirrors the experience of others who have reported
initial success with this population, in terms of implementation of a
multidisciplinary care conference for collaborative discussion and decision
making,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> use of a peer recovery coach for engagement with

ways, mostly related to the rural nature of our location and patient population, as
well as available resources and capacity. This need to adapt a local solution that
would work in our setting is where key elements of the design-thinking process were
crucial. While other programs leveraged pre-existing hospital-based bridge clinics
within their own health care system<sup><xref rid="bibr10-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> for outpatient SUD treatment,
we did not have the ability to do this, both because of lack of such robust existing
resources at our institution and also because of feedback from patients who made it
clear that they would not be able to attend numerous visits at DHMC, often due to
living significant distances from the medical center and not always having routine
access to transportation. Public transportation is extremely limited in our setting.
As such, we instead built partnerships with existing outpatient addiction treatment
providers in the region, some of whom provided telehealth services for patients,
coinciding with the COVID pandemic. In addition, different from experiences reported
in the literature so far,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> we did not increase the frequency of in-person clinical
touchpoints with patients on OPAT after discharge for either substance use or ID
care as compared with routine practice. Also due to our specific setting, though we
uniquely and greatly benefited from close relationships, shared goals, and direct
project team input with a home health nursing agency (VNH) which is part of the
Dartmouth Health (DH) network and a home infusion company (NELC) which is owned in
part by DH, we could not limit our home health agency partnerships to our direct
affiliates because these agencies do not provide coverage to our entire catchment
area. Thus, we forged relationships with multiple home health nursing agencies to
move this work forward throughout the region.</p><p>Finally, to our knowledge, our use of a collaborative OPAT RN and SUD peer recovery
coach team as care coordinators and navigators in the outpatient setting during OPAT
treatment is also unique to our program. Patients expressed a clear need for this
help which was accomplished through this team of health care workers, with an
emphasis on persistence and creativity in communicating with patients despite many
challenges. Numerous examples from our experience thus far suggest that some
patients would not have successfully completed care without this support, and thus
it should be emphasized that this aspect of the intervention was incredibly
important. Similar to findings of others,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-20499361221142476" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> the peer recovery coach
specifically also has helped significantly with initial engagement of patients while
in the hospital, who may not have otherwise opened up to the medical team.</p><p>Our experience and findings are limited in a number of ways. We describe a program
that has worked well for our rural center, but not all aspects may be applicable to
urban or suburban settings. The project and its outcomes were also affected by COVID
pandemic, which coincided with the timing of development and implementation of the
pilot. The pandemic directly affected the project team&#8217;s ability to engage in the
design process. More importantly, local health care utilization patterns were
affected by the pandemic, resulting in a lower admission volume of patients in this
population than expected. In addition, ensuring that all staff were educated about
new practices was difficult due to staffing challenges.</p><p>Our findings in general confirm and expand the experience of others, and add to the
literature by describing the redesign development process, with the inclusion of
patient perspectives, unique aspects for rural settings, and implementation
challenges. We hope that this description will be helpful to clinicians in other
centers who experience similar struggles with this patient population, which
continues to grow. We expect to report outcomes of our intervention in a future
manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients who shared their care experiences and opportunities for
