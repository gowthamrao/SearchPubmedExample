The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the association of this hard-stop EHR intervention with changes in NRT orders during hospitalisation and at discharge during this natural experiment. We also evaluated whether the EHR intervention was associated with patient-reported quit rates 30 days after discharge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>This study was conducted within KPNC, a non-profit, large, vertically integrated health system with a fully integrated EHR providing comprehensive healthcare services to 4.5&#8201;million members in Northern California across 21 hospitals.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> KPNC serves a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population representing 51% of the health insurance market share in California.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Due to the vertically integrated nature of the health system, KPNC can provide full-service outpatient and inpatient tobacco control measures and follow-up. In 2015, KPNC implemented systemwide hard-stop EHR interventions in the form of order-sets recommending the orders of NRT on hospital admission in February 2015 and on hospital discharge in September 2015. Clinicians could choose to bypass the order-set completely by indicating that they will return to it at a later time. If they did not want to prescribe NRT, they would have to choose one of the prespecified choices for not ordering NRT as described in the Results section. There was no explicit documentation about the patient&#8217;s willingness to quit other than the reason for not ordering NRT. The admission order-set and the discharge order-set were implemented at two separate points in time as noted above and are thus treated as two separate interventions. NRT prescriptions in KPNC during this period did not require copays by patients. Smoking cessation supports during admission and at discharge were separately used by the Joint Commission for hospital accreditation purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>We used an interrupted time series (ITS) design, one of the strongest quasiexperimental study designs, to quantify changes in levels and trends in NRT orders and quit rates during the 24 months before and after implementation of the intervention at KPNC.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Inclusion criteria were (1) KPNC adult members aged 18 years and older who were hospitalised for any reason, (2) Kaiser Permanente health plan membership at the time of hospital admission and during the following 30 days and (3) current smokers per self-reported data in the EHR within 6 months before or during hospital admission. Patients with prior NRT orders before their hospitalisation were included. Patients enrolled in hospice, who died or who eloped during their admission were excluded. All hospitalisations during the study period were included. This study was approved by the KPNC Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>There was no patient and public involvement in the design of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Outcomes and exposures</title><p>The primary outcomes were the percentage of patients receiving NRT orders during admission and at discharge. NRT orders included choices between FDA-approved nicotine patches and gum based on the number of packs per day per the patient&#8217;s reported smoking history. Discharge NRT orders included new prescriptions as well as continued preadmission prescriptions. The secondary outcome was the percentage of patients reporting new quits within 30 days following discharge (where the discharge order-set implementation was used as the change point for ITS and pre-post modelling). In KPNC, postdischarge outpatient appointments are automatically scheduled. Medical assistants consistently screened for smoking status during the visit and any change in the reported smoking status in the EHR from &#8216;current smoker&#8217; to &#8216;former smoker&#8217; was noted as a new quit. Due to the integration at KPNC, all new quits were recorded directly into the EHR. During the postintervention period, in cases where NRT was not ordered, the documented reason why NRT was not ordered was noted. Bupropion and varenicline prescription data were assessed during the study period as a means for controlling background trends for changes in systemic smoking cessation interventions in the health system as they are used in smoking cessation regimens at KPNC but are not in this specific EHR intervention. Data on patient age, race/ethnicity, sex, census-based neighbourhood household median income and Medicaid enrolment were extracted from the EHR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An ITS design estimates the change from preintervention to postintervention in an outcome and tests whether this change is more than would be expected if the intervention never occurred. For each month during the study period, a percentage was derived by counting all outcomes (the numerator) among all hospitalisations (the denominator). The months were divided into preimplementation and postimplementation periods following a 2-year period before and after each order-set intervention. For discharge NRT orders and quit attempts, the 2&#8201;years before the discharge intervention (1/9/2013 to 31/8/2015) served as the preimplementation period. The 2&#8201;years afterwards served as the postimplementation period (1/9/2015 to 30/9/2017). For admission NRT, the preimplementation period covered 17 months before the admit hard-stop implementation (1/9/2013 to 31/1/2015) and the postimplementation period covered 31 months after implementation (1/2/2015 to 30/9/2017). The months during and after each intervention (admit: 1/2/2015 to 31/1/2015; discharge: 1/9/2015 to 30/10/2015) were excluded from the analysis to allow lead-in time for the implementation of interventions. We analysed data in SAS, V.9.4 (SAS Institute). Each of the ITS models controlled for both intervention periods as well as for the background trend in each outcome (ie, change in the outcome expected without the interventions). To further account for the influence of concurrent trends in smoking cessation prescribing systemwide, we included a model term for monthly orders of smoking cessation medications not part of the hard-stop order-set (varenicline, bupropion). The simplest models assessed the immediate preimpact to postimpact of the interventions. Additional models checked for a change in slope, or trend, by including an interaction term between the primary intervention and time. More details are included in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref>. For the quit attempt models, patients were excluded from the formal model if they did not have smoking status recorded in the 30 days following inpatient discharge. However, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of this exclusion.</p><supplementary-material id="SP1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2022-068629.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>

A pre-post bivariate method with &#967;<sup>2</sup> tests was used to assess absolute changes in the primary and secondary outcomes over the year prior to the intervention (1/1/2014 to 31/12/2014) as compared with the year following the intervention (1/1/2016 to 31/12/2016). Poisson regression was performed to account for changes in the distribution of patient characteristics that could contribute to the change in outcome trends around intervention implementation. Further descriptive analysis included reporting frequencies for the reason chosen by the clinician for not ordering smoking cessation medication if the order was omitted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study population characteristics</title><p>A total of 41&#8201;805 patient encounters were identified with 20&#8201;847 encounters in the preintervention period and 20&#8201;958 encounters in the postintervention period with 29&#8201;245 unique patients represented.

There was a 39.5% absolute increase in NRT orders filled at discharge between 2014 and 2016 from 1345 (21.9%) in 2014 to 4621 (61.4%) in 2016 (p&lt;0.001), with a significantly increased likelihood of NRT prescriptions filled at discharge following the intervention (RR: 2.8, 95%&#8201;CI 2.68 to 2.93).

Patients who did not have a follow-up smoking status change were younger, were more likely to be women, African American, have Medicaid insurance, and have received NRT on discharge. Following the discharge intervention (but not the admit intervention), there was a small but significant spike in new self-reported quits (ITS estimate 5.0%, 95%&#8201;CI 2.2% to 7.8%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>). To account for any selection bias caused by the exclusion of patients without any smoking status noted in the follow-up visit, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that included all patients in the quit attempt analysis (with smoking status, without smoking status or without follow-up) with similar results, showing a significant increase in quit attempts in the postimplementation period (ITS estimate 4.0%, 95%&#8201;CI 1.6% to 6.4%). The ITS model suggested no background trend in new quits in either the preintervention or postintervention periods, but there were significant autocorrelation terms at the first and seventh order, suggesting a potential seasonal cycle for changes in new quits over the year. In the pre-post analysis, the rates of patient-reported new quits increased from 2077 (24.5%) in 2014 to 2564 (30.7%) in 2016 (p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).

This study is among the first to show a health systemwide EHR intervention can improve smoking cessation therapy prescription rates associated with hospitalisations. Results are consistent with findings from a pharmacist-led opt-out cessation treatment integrated into existing inpatient medical reconciliation workflows.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Prior evidence has shown that NRT is underprescribed during hospitalisations regardless of the reason for admission.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A 2014 Cochrane review of EHR-embedded smoking cessation tools found no studies that showed an effect on prescriptions for smoking cessation medications.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Interestingly, the largest increase in NRT prescriptions on discharge was associated with the implementation of the admission order-set, suggesting that once NRT was ordered as part of the admission orders, clinicians were more likely to continue it upon discharge. The implementation of the discharge order-set in addition had an additional increase in discharge NRT orders as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> through the interrupted time series design. This type of EHR mechanism can ensure equity in types of care delivery and simplify clinical practices by standardising work in a population health setting.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Smoking cessation interventions during hospitalisations have been shown to be cost-effective,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and this type of simple intervention built into an existing EHR can lead to even further cost-savings.</p><p>The small yet significant improvement in new quits over the month following hospitalisations is very encouraging. Due to the integrated study setting, 82% of hospitalisations had a follow-up outpatient visit in the 30 days following discharge where smoking status was recorded. Quits increased acutely after implementation of the discharge order-set only, which suggests the cumulative increase in NRT prescriptions at discharge from both order-sets could be especially helpful in promoting quitting after leaving the hospital. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that patients who reported new quits also had significantly higher rates of discharge NRT and not admission NRT. This EHR intervention led to an increased rate of NRT prescriptions at discharge. However, clinicians were able to work around the intervention as observed rates of NRT prescriptions were not universal despite the goal of this type of EHR hard-stop to standardise clinician behaviour and reduce bias. The ability of the clinician to forego ordering the NRT was crucial to ensure that clinical discretion could be used to ensure that the patient received appropriate care. However, clinicians may be choosing to bypass the ordering of NRT volitionally as part of their clinical judgement or in error by choosing options that noted that the NRT was ordered separately or patient refused when that may not have been the case. Additional studies that examine clinician-level factors that may impact NRT orders in response to an EHR-based intervention are needed. A recent study in China suggested a decrease in further admissions for cardiovascular events after the implementation of a multipronged smoking cessation approach using an interrupted time series analysis.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple EHR intervention on not only medication prescription but also new quits. Certain patient characteristics like age were associated with NRT prescriptions.</p><p>Interestingly, compared with non-Hispanic white patients, those of every other race and ethnicity noted were less likely to have NRT orders on admission, but only Hispanic patients were less likely to have NRT orders on discharge. It is not clear if this is due to patient or provider preference and further study into this association with race is needed. Further, additional research is needed to investigate other factors associated with NRT prescribing (eg, clinician specialty or reason for patient admission).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The limitations of this study include the observational nature of the ITS design as there could be confounders changing at the same time as the interventions that we have not controlled for. The quit rate studied here is patient reported and thus could be falsely high due to reporting bias.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, since follow-up was not universal, we could have also undercounted the overall quits. Patients could start smoking again after the 30-day period, and thus the quit rate reported is not evidence of permanent smoking cessation. Data from patients excluded including those who died during their admission could not be assessed and could have led to an inflation of quit rates reported; however, they would not have been eligible for the intervention studied. We were not able to assess whether patients actually used the NRT that was ordered (eg, patients could have declined NRT at the bedside). Further, the lack of data on the number of doses given or the duration of treatment is also a limitation. Additional studies are needed to see whether the benefits of this EHR intervention are sustained over long periods of time or translatable to other settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strengths</title><p>The strengths of this study include the large populationwide assessment with an interrupted time series design of a simple intervention to improve smoking cessation support prescriptions. In the absence of a natural control group (ie, patients excluded from the intervention), the counterfactual (what would have happened in the absence of the policy) is estimated using stable baseline trends. The inclusion of drugs not included in the intervention as a means of controlling for prescribing trends adds to the strength of this type of assessment of a natural experiment. This EHR intervention may not be as easily replicable in settings without an integrated, robust EHR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the USA, less than a third of smokers trying to quit use evidence-based smoking cessation strategies such as NRT.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Tobacco cessation treatment at the time of hospital discharge is the standard of care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A simple EHR hard-stop intervention can greatly improve smoking cessation therapy prescriptions during hospitalisations and may be associated with a small yet significant improvement in smoking cessation in this diverse population studied. In this cohort, the admission EHR intervention was associated with an increase in discharge NRT prescriptions; however, the medications on discharge seemed to be more strongly associated with new smoking quits rather than the NRT orders during admission themselves. Therefore, prioritising EHR interventions to ensure discharge NRT should be a goal for other healthcare systems implementing similar interventions. A successful smoking cessation intervention during hospitalisation may be especially apt as it targets a vulnerable population at high risk of significant comorbidities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e147" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-068629.reviewer_comments.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e148" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author's
