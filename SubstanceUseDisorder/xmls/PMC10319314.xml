This study aimed to determine whether any of three interventions designed specifically for low-income smokers would be more effective than standard tobacco quitline services: a specialized quitline, the specialized quitline with social needs navigation, or the standard quitline with social needs navigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using a randomized 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 factorial design, low-income daily cigarette smokers (n&#160;=&#160;1944) in Missouri, USA who called a helpline seeking assistance with food, rent or other social needs were assigned to receive <italic toggle="yes">Standard Quitline</italic> alone (n&#160;=&#160;485), <italic toggle="yes">Standard Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation</italic> (n&#160;=&#160;484), <italic toggle="yes">Specialized Quitline</italic> alone (n&#160;=&#160;485), or <italic toggle="yes">Specialized Quitline</italic>&#160;+&#160;<italic toggle="yes">Social Needs Navigation</italic> (n&#160;=&#160;490). The target sample size was 2000, 500 per group. The main outcome was 7-day self-reported point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Multiple imputation was used to impute outcomes for those missing data at 6-month follow-up. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess differences between study groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Participants were recruited from June 2017 to November 2020; most were African American (1111 [58%]) or White (666 [35%]), female (1396 [72%]), and reported &lt;$10,000 (957 [51%]) or &lt;$20,000 (1529 [82%]) annual pre-tax household income. At 6-month follow-up (58% retention), 101 participants in the Standard Quitline group reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (20.8% of those assigned at baseline, 38.1% after imputation). Quit rates in the Specialized Quitline (90 quitters, 18.6%, 38.1%) and Specialized Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation (103 quitters, 21.0%, 39.8%) were not different from the Standard Quitline. Quit rates for Standard Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation (74 quitters, 15.3%, 30.1%) were significantly lower than Standard Quitline (OR&#160;=&#160;0.70, 95% CI&#160;=&#160;0.50&#8211;0.98).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>A specialized version of a state tobacco quitline was no more effective than standard quitline services in helping low-income smokers quit.

Another systematic review of 65 quantitative and qualitative studies identified three main barriers to cessation for low-income smokers: high stress, high prevalence and acceptability of smoking, and limited support in quitting. To make cessation services available population wide and regardless of income, free telephone tobacco quitlines&#8212;delivering evidence-based telephone cessation counseling&#8212;exist in every state and many countries. A 2019 Cochrane review of 104 studies reported moderate-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of telephone counseling for smoking cessation, with significant risk ratios compared to self-help or minimal interventions (RR&#160;=&#160;1.35), brief interventions (RR&#160;=&#160;1.30) and when added to pharmacotherapy for cessation (RR&#160;=&#160;1.14). However, a review of 65 of the Cochrane-included studies that were conducted in the U.S. concluded that evidence for effectiveness was less clear among low-SES smokers, due to both mixed results and a paucity of studies that reported SES data.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">A specialized quitline designed to address unique barriers to quitting among low-income smokers did not yield significantly higher cessation rates than standard quitline services. Pairing standard quitline services with a social needs intervention to address low-income smokers&#8217; financial stressors such as food, rent and utility payments significantly decreased cessation rates compared to the standard quitline alone. Findings suggest that when delivered simultaneously, a social needs intervention may actually interfere with standard quitline services among low-income smokers.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">In 2018, tobacco quitline services were available in 66 countries. Assuring these services are effective for and responsive to the needs of the most underserved smokers is essential for achieving health equity.</p></sec></boxed-text>

Tobacco quitlines are recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force based on strong evidence that they increase cessation among those interested in quitting.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> The Missouri Tobacco Quitline uses Optum&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Quit For Life&#174;</italic> program. <italic toggle="yes">Quit For Life&#174;</italic> coaches are trained in behavior change science and motivational interviewing, and provide phone counseling and individually tailored plans to help smokers quit. Coaches initiate contact with a smoker, help them set a quit date in the next 30 days, and schedule future counseling sessions. Sessions last 10&#8211;15&#160;min, spanning 1&#8211;3 months around the quit date. Smokers may contact the quitline outside of scheduled sessions for assistance. Coaches make three attempts to reach a smoker for each scheduled session. When study recruitment began in June 2017, the Missouri Tobacco Quitline provided up to four coaching sessions, access to online and texting programs supporting cessation counseling, a printed self-help Quit Guide, and 2 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (gum or patches, hereafter NRT) to most smokers (excluding those with contraindications or Medicaid coverage providing NRT benefits available through a doctor).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4.2"><title>Specialized tobacco quitline</title><p id="p0080">Together with Optum, we adapted the standard quitline to address unique cessation barriers experienced by low-income smokers. Adaptations involved training and personnel, content and delivery, and implementation protocol. A subset of coaches trained to participate in research and interested in helping low-income smokers quit was selected and trained to understand the social context of smoking in low-income individuals. Training focused on life stressors, unmet social needs, social norms around smoking, lack of social support for quitting, and resistance to using NRT. Coaches learned to ask about these challenges during cessation counseling, and modify their approach accordingly. Because many low-SES individuals value lived experience and problem solving as expertise,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> coaches were encouraged to share how long they&#8217;ve been helping smokers quit, and whether they were former smokers.</p><p id="p0085">Coaches adapted content and delivery of cessation counseling in multiple ways. As examples, to counter low knowledge about NRT, they explained what it is, how it works, that it improves success quitting, makes quitting easier, and encouraged them to try it. Common cessation tips that could be inappropriate for smokers of limited financial means (e.g., &#8220;buy straws to chew on&#8221;) or those living in small crowded spaces (e.g., &#8220;find a quiet place in your house&#8221;), were replaced with more suitable tips (e.g., &#8220;doodle or draw,&#8221; &#8220;brush your teeth&#8221;). Whenever possible, quit coaches linked participants&#8217; experience dealing with social needs to their quitting goals (e.g., &#8220;money saved by not buying cigarettes can help pay the rent&#8221;), and emphasized it as a personal strength that could help with quitting (&#8220;if you can deal with your landlord, you are strong enough to quit smoking&#8221;).</p><p id="p0090">Coaches were trained to use open-ended questions to elicit each smoker&#8217;s &#8220;story,&#8221; express empathy for their life challenges, and use concrete and plain language. Commonly used cessation jargon (e.g., &#8220;triggers,&#8221; &#8220;urge management&#8221;) and abbreviations (e.g., &#8220;NRT&#8221;) were replaced with alternatives from a plain language glossary developed for the project. The 50-page Quit Guide mailed to smokers in the Standard Quitline group was replaced by a 13-page version with more graphics, written at 5th grade reading level (vs. 7th in the 50-page version), and addressed cessation barriers for low-income smokers (e.g., cost of NRT).</p><p id="p0095">Delivery protocols for cessation counseling also were adapted. Because low-income individuals change residences and phone numbers more often than others,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> coaches made up to five attempts to reach smokers for each counseling session (vs. three with Standard Quitline), and obtained collateral contact information to reach smokers through family or friends, if needed. Specialized Quitline sessions were allowed to last 25&#8211;30&#160;min (vs. 15 with Standard Quitline), assuring adequate time for learning about a smoker&#8217;s life situation, building rapport, and providing support.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4.3"><title>Social needs navigation</title><p id="p0100">This phone-based intervention aimed to help participants address social needs (e.g., food, rent, utilities, employment, transportation, childcare) causing stress in their lives. Navigators helped participants identify and prioritize social needs, generate solutions, and develop action steps to address the needs. Navigators found local service providers to address specific needs, determined participant eligibility for assistance, made referrals to service providers, coached participants about contacting a service provider, advocated for participants to service providers; arranged for transportation if needed, provided reminders for scheduled appointments, and followed up with participants and service providers to evaluate progress resolving social needs.</p><p id="p0105">The navigator called each participant assigned to this intervention within two weeks of them completing a baseline survey. Those reached and interested could receive navigation for up to three months. Navigation sessions included scheduled follow-up calls and participant-initiated calls, which were encouraged. The number and frequency of navigation sessions was driven by need; participants with complex or multiple needs could receive weekly sessions, while others met less often. There was no limit on number of navigation sessions. Navigation ended when participants no longer requested sessions, stopped responding, or reached the 3-month end date. Navigators made up to 20 attempts to reach participants, leaving voice messages on unanswered calls or sending texts or e-mails if participants preferred. Navigators did not initiate cessation-related discussion; they were blind to which quitline participants were assigned, and if smoking or cessation was mentioned by a participant, referred them to the Missouri Tobacco Quitline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="p0110">Research team members interviewed participants by phone at enrollment (baseline) and 3 and 6 months later (follow-up).

We report the proportion of recordings correctly classified; larger proportions indicate greater fidelity.</p><p id="p0155">Because the Social Needs Navigation intervention was provided in-house by the research team, calls were reviewed by investigators in order to provide ongoing, iterative feedback to navigators in bi-weekly meetings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.5"><title>Analyses of primary outcomes</title><p id="p0160">We used binary logistic regression to compare 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up between four groups: Standard Quitline alone, Standard Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation, Specialized Quitline alone and Specialized Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation. Abstinence rates for each study group were compared to the Standard Quitline (i.e., usual care, referent) using three dummy variables.

Contrary to study hypotheses, a specialized version of the quitline designed for low-income smokers was not significantly better. Among participants assigned to Specialized Quitline alone or Specialized Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation, 43.3% reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up.</p><p id="p0235">Although the Social Needs Navigation intervention was widely used by participants in both groups assigned to receive it, it did not increase cessation. In fact, in the Standard Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation group, it led to significantly lower quit rates than the Standard Quitline alone. One possible explanation is that smokers who are actively working to address unmet social needs don&#8217;t have the time and attention needed to simultaneously plan and execute a quit attempt.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> However, there was no such detrimental effect of Social Needs Navigation when it was combined with the Specialized Quitline. Quit rates for the Specialized Quitline&#160;+&#160;Social Needs Navigation group were similar to those in the Specialized Quitline alone and Standard Quitline alone groups. Perhaps some beneficial aspects of the Specialized Quitline intervention offset possible distraction or competition from Social Needs Navigation.</p><p id="p0240">Prior studies evaluating social needs interventions suggest that although navigation helps connect people to services and resolve their needs, its effectiveness for changing health behaviors and improving health outcomes is mixed.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> A better understanding of pathways and mechanisms through which social needs affect health behaviors could improve interventions.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> Future studies might explore sequential interventions where social needs are addressed first, and health improvement interventions follow.</p><p id="p0245">Analyses of intervention use showed that participants assigned to either group receiving the Specialized Quitline engaged with the intervention more than either group assigned to receive the Standard Quitline. They completed more cessation counseling sessions, spent more time per session talking with a quit coach, and were more likely to get NRT from the Quitline. In prior quitline research, completing multiple quitline sessions (as 466 of 975, 47%, did in the two Specialized Quitline groups) and receiving NRT (as 504 of 975, 52%, did in the two Specialized Quitline groups) are both associated with increased odds of cessation.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> Key features of the Specialized Quitline align closely with these intervention use outcomes. For example, we allowed Specialized Quitline coaches to make more call attempts to reach a smoker and talk longer if a smoker was interested. The Specialized Quitline also emphasized overcoming resistance to NRT. These design features may have improved participant engagement (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#160;2</xref>), even though group differences in engagement did not translate into higher rates of cessation among those receiving the intervention. Not all attributes of the Specialized Quitline were specifically evaluated in follow-up interviews, so we don&#8217;t know whether or how other aspects of this approach (e.g., content, delivery) influenced intervention use, or whether they could have contributed to higher attrition rates (e.g., more call attempts being viewed as bothersome).</p><p id="p0250">The research partnerships upon which the study was built provide additional insights and opportunities for tobacco control efforts. Using two simple screening questions administered to a small sample of its total callers, a 211 helpline in one state identified over 13,000 very low-income, racially diverse daily smokers, half of whom wanted to quit. Because 211s exist in every state and collectively receive 12&#8211;15 million calls per year,<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> they would be an excellent partner for state tobacco quitlines to proactively reach more low-income smokers and connect them to proven cessation assistance. Optum, the quitline service provider in the study, demonstrated the feasibility of delivering the Specialized Quitline intervention with existing staff, systems and infrastructure.</p><p id="p0255">Although the study sample was recruited through a statewide service and included participants from 293 ZIP codes in Missouri, generalizability remains a limitation. Participants are from one state and had to call 211 to be eligible. Thus, in nearly all cases, they were actively seeking assistance with social needs at the time of enrollment. This helps explain some of the defining sample characteristics. For example, compared to 65 studies we recently reviewed examining phone counseling for cessation,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> our sample is among a very small number with such low-income levels. Although remote biochemical verification was largely acceptable to the participants who used it,<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> usage was low. This aligns with prior research,<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> and suggests biochemical verification may not add appreciably to confidence in self-reported cessation in minimal contact community intervention trials.</p><p id="p0260">Fidelity of the Specialized Quitline intervention declined over time. In post-hoc analyses we found that fidelity declined most in three (out of 13) criteria, which seemed to account for the increasing misclassification. These were: using a metaphor to endorse NRT use, acknowledging that the next quitline session could be with a different quit coach, and emphasizing the positive aspects of talking with a different quit coach. One possible explanation is that as new quitline staff were hired and trained over the course of the study, these elements of the specialized quitline inadvertently received less emphasis. We don&#8217;t know whether or how declines in these specific features may have impacted study outcomes.</p><p id="p0265">We recognize that the 58% 6-month follow-up rate may seem low to some. However, this was a community-based field trial conducted with an extremely low-income sample that was selected because they were actively seeking help with social needs such as rent and utility payment assistance. Such populations are transient and can have high rates of turnover in phone service. Also, the final year of data collection for the study took place in the midst of a global pandemic during which recruitment and response rates dropped significantly in telephone survey research nationally in the U.S.<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> and in our study. Despite these considerable obstacles, the retention rate was similar to comparable studies from our team.<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref></p><p id="p0270">Study findings have implications for population-level cessation services such as tobacco quitlines, and their ability to reach, engage and help low-income smokers quit. Proactive screening for smoking through social needs helplines is not currently standard practice for quitlines, but in this study helped identified thousands of low-income smokers interested in quitting. Adaptations to make quitline services more responsive to the unique needs of low-income smokers increased use of telephone cessation counseling and receipt of NRT. Even though greater intervention use did not translate into higher cessation rates at 6-month follow-up, it may have longer-term benefits not tracked in this study, such as higher rates of re-engagement in cessation efforts in the future.<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> Although having unmet social needs is associated with higher rates of smoking in low-income adults,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> supplementing standard quitline services with a social needs intervention resulted in lower cessation rates and is therefore not recommended. We conclude that specialized quitline services for low-income smokers confer modest benefits related to increased engagement with a cessation intervention, but do not lead to higher cessation rates within six months. Helping low-income smokers address unmet social needs appears to be detrimental to simultaneous cessation efforts.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0275">MK is PI of the study.
