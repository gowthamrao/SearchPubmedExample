OMO-1 is a small molecule inhibitor of MET. Module 1 (OMO-1 monotherapy) consisted of Part A (dose escalation) and Part B (expansion cohorts). Part A assessed the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of OMO-1 given as monotherapy in unselected patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic malignancies and determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part B assessed the preliminary efficacy of the RP2D of OMO-1 in patients with METex14-positive NSCLC (cohort 1) and patients with MET amplified NSCLC or patients with other MET positive solid tumors, either METex14 or MET amplification (MET basket; cohort 2). The MET status of the tumor was assessed locally by site-specific guidelines. For MET exon 14 skipping mutations next generation sequencing (NGS) was used and for MET amplifications either NGS or fluorescence in situ hybridization (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary 1</xref>). Prior treatment with a MET inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. Module 2 (OMO-1 in combination with EGFR TKI) investigated the preliminary efficacy of OMO-1 in patients with activating EGFR mutated NSCLC and an acquired MET amplification after EGFR TKI treatment. The study was conducted at 8 clinical centers in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was approved by the Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (Ref 17/SC/0229) and by all local ethical committees of the participating sites. All patients provided written informed consent before undergoing any study procedures.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of OMO-1 when given orally to patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid malignancies and to define the dose and schedule for further clinical evaluation. Secondary objectives were to assess the preliminary efficacy of OMO-1 by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of OMO-1, following a single dose and/or at steady state after multiple dosing, when given orally as monotherapy or in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI).</p><p>Eligible patients were aged &#8805;18 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-1, adequate organ function, histological, or cytological confirmation of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid malignancy refractory to conventional treatment. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or current use of metformin (OMO-1 might increase exposure to metformin because metformin is secreted by OCT-2), prior splenectomy, active illness or viral infection, symptomatic CNS metastases, a history of epilepsy or uveitis, abnormal urinary function or outflow obstruction, and previous bone marrow transplant or recent surgery.</p><p>OMO-1 was administered orally, twice daily (BID) with a minimal interval of 4-5 h with food in a continuous 21 day/cycle regimen until clinical progression or emergence of significant toxicity. The starting dose was 100 mg BID. The dose was escalated sequentially in cohorts of at least 3 patients using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Dose-escalation stopped when significant safety or tolerability concerns were observed in 2 or more patients and where the non-optimal long-term exposure dose (OLED) was exceeded. The RP2D was defined as the maximum dose whereby the safety or tolerability findings did not exceed 1 out of 6 patients. Computed tomography (CT) based tumor assessments were conducted according to RECISTv1.1 at screening and every 6 weeks once study treatment had commenced. Safety assessments were continually assessed and based on all adverse events (AEs; graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, 2009 (NCI-CTCAE v 4.0)), clinical laboratory data, and physical examinations. In view of the association between MET inhibition and ocular toxicity, ophthalmological examination was conducted at baseline.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In addition to urea and creatinine, tests of renal function such as serum Cystatin C and urinary KIM1 were conducted at baseline and on day 1 of subsequent treatment cycles. During the monotherapy dose escalation Module 1 Part A, blood samples were collected for PK analysis throughout the study as per protocol (S1). To explore the effects of the OCT-2 inhibition plasma levels of tryptophan and kynurenine were sampled. The difference in mean tryptophan plasma levels before and after OMO-1 exposure was statistically tested with a paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (if data is normally distributed) or a Wilcoxon signed rank test (if not normally distributed).</p><p>The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period was within the first cycle of treatment; although all events beyond this point were also reviewed at the time of dose escalation to ensure an OLED was chosen as RP2D. A DLT was defined as any of the following occurring during the DLT-evaluation period: grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity (excluding nausea/vomiting/diarrhea that responded to standard medical treatment), grade 4 hematological toxicity, febrile neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, QTc prolongation (&gt;500 ms, or 60 ms above baseline), any toxicity related to OMO-1 that was clinically significant or unacceptable or unresolved after a treatment delay of &gt;14 days and any toxicity clinically significant and/or unacceptable, greater than that at baseline and judged to be a DLT by the SRC.</p><sec id="s7"><title>Safety and Preliminary Efficacy Analyses</title><p>Safety analyses were descriptive. With respect to primary objectives and endpoints, no specific hypotheses were tested statistically. The primary focus was on determining the safety profile and RP2D, and the identification of a range of biologically active doses and PK of OMO-1 in patients with cancer. Safety, PK, and PD biomarker data were reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the cohort progression criteria by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Preliminary efficacy of OMO-1 by RECIST 1.1. was assessed locally. The best overall percentage change in tumor size is defined as the percentage change from baseline value that represents the largest decrease or smallest increase (data as provided by local assessment). The clinical benefit rate is derived as the proportion of patients with a partial response or a duration of stable disease (SD) of at least 8 weeks. Initially, the design in Module 1 Part A included parallel cohorts of patients with MET-positive tumors per dose level. Eventually, these patients were analyzed in Part B in expansion cohorts.

In cohort 3 (400 mg BID) also no DLTs were reported, but 2 out of 3 patients required a dose reduction due to treatment-related toxicity and 6 TEAEs led to OMO-1 treatment discontinuation in 2 patients (66.7%). In one of these 2 patients, the TEAEs leading to discontinuation were drug-related nausea, increased bilirubin, increased creatinine, and diarrhea (increased stoma output) (CTCAE grade 2). The other patient was discontinued due to hypersensitivity to OMO-1 (CTCAE grade 2; retching and tremor after administration) after a previous dose reduction due to drug-related flu-like symptoms (CTCAE grade 3). Although these TEAES were not reported as formal DLTs, further treatment at that dose level was precluded as decided by the SRC. In addition, the planned dose level of 600 mg BID was replaced by a lower dose level of 250 mg BID (cohort 4). No DLTs or significant safety concerns were seen in cohort 4. Cohort 5 (350 mg BID) was the final dose-escalation. However, the nature of the AEs reported in the 400 mg BID and 350 mg BID, along with the high rate of TEAEs leading to withdrawal resulted in the SRC deciding that these doses were not in keeping with long term dosing; therefore, 250 mg BID was chosen as the monotherapy RP2D.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Analysis of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events in Module 1 (Monotherapy) Part A (Dose Escalation)</title><p>In 23 out of 24 patients in Module 1 Part A (monotherapy, dose-escalation), 129 drug-related TEAE were recorded.

PD analysis of a paired biopsy of a patient with METex14 mutated NSCLC showed near-complete inhibition of phosphorylated MET. Moreover, we observed modest clinical efficacy of OMO-1 in patients with METex14 mutated NSCLC. The development of more highly selective MET inhibitors is crucial for optimal treatment of MET exon 14 skipping mutation-positive NSCLC patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In the dose-escalation cohorts, OMO-1 was tolerated in the majority of the patients on the lower dose-levels (100, 200, and 250 mg BID). As discussed in the dose-escalation results section, 400 mg BID and 350 mg BID were deemed not suitable for long-term dosing. The safety profile of OMO-1 is mostly comparable to other MET TKIs, but more patients on OMO-1 had to discontinue treatment due to toxicity than with capmatinib and tepotinib (also in the lower dose cohorts).<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Also, more gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in patients on OMO-1 (250 mg BD, all grades; nausea&#8212;57%, vomiting&#8212;43%, diarrhea&#8212;14%), than with capmatinib (all grades; nausea&#8212;46%, vomiting&#8212;26%, diarrhea&#8212;17%), and tepotinib (all grades; nausea&#8212;26%, vomiting&#8212;6%, diarrhea&#8212;22%). The mechanism behind the difference in toxicity is unknown. Another important drug-related TEAE was increased blood creatinine which is due to the competitive inhibition of creatinine secretion by OCT2. In the phase I trial of OMO-1 in healthy human volunteers no renal toxicity was observed, suggesting that increased blood creatinine does not translate into kidney injury during OMO-1 treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In this trial, additional markers for renal function to reliably evaluate possible kidney injury, eg, cystatin C and KIM-1, did also not identify any significant renal function issues in monotherapy OMO-1. This on-target effect on blood creatinine levels was notable, but mostly mild and overall did not cause any issues with OMO-1 administration. In contrast, the predecessor compound of OMO-1, JNJ-38877605, had renal toxic properties, which precluded it from further development.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> No reports were made of peripheral edema related to OMO-1, which is described as a common AE for MET inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The mechanism behind MET inhibition-related peripheral edema is yet to be elucidated, so it is unclear why OMO-1 does not cause edema.</p><p>As theorized, the mean plasma tryptophan level increased 8 h after OMO-1 administration and the mean kynurenin/tryptophan ratio decreased. This supports the hypothesis that OMO-1 inhibits the active secretion of tryptophan through OCT-2. In some patients, tryptophan levels decreased which could be due to low drug exposure, but we could not confirm this. As tryptophan is an amino acid present in most protein-based foods, food intake could be a confounding factor. Validation of these results in a larger cohort with dietary monitoring would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Following the dose-escalation part, the efficacy of OMO-1 was investigated in selected expansion cohorts; METex14 mutated NSCLC, other MET amplified, or MET mutated solid tumors (basket cohort). In METex14 mutated NSCLC, OMO-1 showed modest efficacy as almost all patients had stable disease as best response and no partial response (RECIST v.1.1) was recorded. One of the reasons for this low response rate could be the prior therapy status of the patients. Most patients had received prior anti-cancer therapy, which could have induced molecular heterogeneity and instability leading to accelerated development of resistance mechanisms. This negative effect of prior therapy has also been seen in trials with other MET TKIs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, no patients were treated with a MET TKI prior to OMO-1. Additionally, in 40% of the patients a co-occurring mutation was present potentially causing intrinsic resistance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Other new MET TKIs, like capmatinib and tepotinib, have shown impressive results in METex14 mutated NSCLC with object response rates of 68% (95% CI: 48, 84) to capmatinib and 43% (95% CI: 32%, 56%) to tepotinib with a median response duration of respectively 12.6 months (95% CI: 5.5, 25.3) and 10.8 months (95% CI: 6.9, not estimable).<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Both drugs have also received accelerated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of metastasized NSCLC. In the MET basket cohort, no clinical efficacy was seen. We believe this can be attributed to the level of MET amplification in the tumors, as none of the patients had a tumor with a high-level MET amplification (&#8805;10 GCN). The most recent research shows that only high-level MET amplifications should be recognized as driver events and are therefore susceptible to targeted therapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This is substantiated by the fact that low to medium MET amplified tumors (&lt;10 GCN) are less sensitive to MET TKIs than high MET amplified tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In addition to the difference in response, high-level MET amplifications seem to be mutually exclusive with other known driver mutations, whereas low-level amplified tumors often contain a co-occurring driver mutation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> At the time of trial design, the stratification of MET amplification was not yet common practice and therefore this was not part of the inclusion criteria. In further research with MET TKIs it would be recommended to enrich for high-level MET amplified solid tumors. Unfortunately, there is still no gold standard definition of high-level MET amplification and this also differs per technique used.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> There are signals that MET amplified NSCLC might be sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors, however only limited and retrospective research has been done.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Therefore, compounds like OMO-1 combining potential immunomodulatory effects with targeted therapy could be an interesting mode of therapy for this group, although the actual immunomodulatory effects of OMO-1 in vivo remain unclear. Because OMO-1 will not be further developed for this indication, no additional insights can be gained.</p><p>The combination of OMO-1 and an EGFR TKI in EGFR mutated and MET-amplified NSCLC (Module 2) was investigated after the dose-escalation part in Module 1. As the trial was closed prematurely due to a strategic decision (including lack of funding), only one patient was included in this combination cohort in Module 2. After failure on an EGFR TKI, OMO-1 was able to bypass the resistance to the EGFR TKI, resulting in a partial response with a treatment benefit of more than 5 months, which is comparable to similar trials.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, OMO-1 is safe and well tolerated to administer at doses up to 250 mg BID and shows preliminary clinical efficacy in pre-selected patients with METex14 mutated NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the participating patient and site staff for their participation and contributions to this study.
