Introduction</title><p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases constitute the most common cause of death as far as all of the recorded fatalities, both in Europe and worldwide, are concerned [<xref rid="B1-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among other factors, the rapid economic development and industrialization of most countries have contributed to an increase in the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) [<xref rid="B2-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SCA is a sudden and severe medical condition involving the cessation of the heart&#8217;s mechanical activity. It results in the stoppage of blood circulation, cessation of breathing, and consequently leads to irreversible brain damage [<xref rid="B3-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Poland, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is relatively high, amounting to 146 cases per 100,000 inhabitants annually [<xref rid="B4-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following the chain of survival, which includes early recognition and calling for help by bystanders, early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation, and post-resuscitation care, offers the greatest chances of saving a person who has experienced SCA [<xref rid="B5-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are four types of SCA rhythms: asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA)&#8212;both of which do not require defibrillation&#8212;and ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT)&#8212;where defibrillation is essential to restore a normal heart rhythm [<xref rid="B6-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the first minutes of cardiac arrest, VF occurs in 76% of cases [<xref rid="B5-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]&#8212;the most favorable rhythm among rhythms in patients with SCA [<xref rid="B7-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Untreated cardiac arrest leads to the patient&#8217;s death. In Poland, in cases of OHCA, resuscitation is performed by the emergency medical team (EMT) at the scene. The EMT do not initiate resuscitation if there are cardinal signs of death (postmortem lividity, postmortem coldness, postmortem rigidity, putrefaction, decomposition, skeletonization). When the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is observed, the patient is transported to the hospital. ROSC was defined as the achievement of cardiac circulation with the presence of an organized heart rhythm with a pulse in the jugular artery at any point during the resuscitation attempt. Transporting a person with a SCA to hospital during resuscitation is permissible when there is a reversible cause of SCA. The EMTs perform medical emergency procedures (MEPs) recommended by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC). The EMTs use a manual defibrillator, secure the airway with a tracheal tube or supraglottic devices, ventilate using a manual resuscitator or respirator, use capnography, provide intravenous or intraosseous injection, and administer drugs such as adrenaline, amiodarone, lidocaine, oxygen, and apply fluid therapy [<xref rid="B5-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The arrival of the EMT at the scene of an incident often takes too long. In most communities, the average response time for the EMT to reach the scene is 5 to 8 min [<xref rid="B8-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A key factor in improving survival rates in the case of OHCA is the bystander&#8217;s actions within the framework of basic life support (BLS); it may triple survival rates along with favorable neurological outcomes [<xref rid="B10-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Performing CPR ensures a small but significant circulation of blood to the brain and heart [<xref rid="B12-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In the European countries, the survival rate for individuals who experience OHCA before reaching the hospital is very low, at just 8% [<xref rid="B13-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The ERC emphasizes the ongoing development of the first aid provided by bystanders, including the use of mobile technologies and the implementation of social campaigns focused on training children, youth, and adults in CPR [<xref rid="B14-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze cases of OHCA, assess the actions taken by bystanders in the event of cardiac arrest in the injured person, and analyze the procedures followed by the EMT in the cases of OHCA. Additionally, another aim was to evaluate the factors influencing ROSC in patients with OHCA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jcm-13-07765"><title>2.

This study covered the area of the City of Bialystok, which occupies an area of 102.13 km<sup>2</sup> and has a population of approximately 298,000 inhabitants [<xref rid="B15-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The inclusion criterion encompassed the cases in which a patient experienced cardiac arrest according to ICD-10 codes (I46, I49.0, R96, R98, R99) before EMT arrival or during EMT procedures. A total of 787 cases from the studied group met the above criteria. This group included cases of patients with cardinal signs of death (n = 132). The exclusion criteria were all ICD-10 codes other than those mentioned above or incorrectly completed dispatch records (<xref rid="jcm-13-07765-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The data were collected according to a self-administered questionnaire completed by the researcher.

Distribution of OHCA</title><p>Based on the conducted research, it was found that the incidence of OHCA in the area of Bialystok was 133.1 per 100,000 residents per year.</p><p>The highest number of cases was observed in the winter months: January (11.31%&#8212;89 cases), February (10.67%&#8212;84 cases), and December (10.42%&#8212;82 cases). This study indicated a lower number of cases in May (9.40%&#8212;74 cases), March (9.02%&#8212;71 cases), and November (8.77%&#8212;69 cases). Cardiac arrests were significantly less frequent during the summer months: July (7.50%&#8212;59 cases) and August (6.99%&#8212;55 cases). Even fewer OHCA cases occurred in April and June (6.73% each&#8212;53 cases), in October (6.61%&#8212;52 cases), and in September (5.84%&#8212;46 cases).

The highest number of OHCA cases in Bialystok occurred on Mondays (15.73%&#8212;103 cases) and Sundays (16.34%&#8212;107 cases). Only the cases without signs of death were taken into consideration (n = 655) (<xref rid="jcm-13-07765-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-jcm-13-07765"><title>3.1.1. Distribution of OHCA Cases by Localization</title><p>OHCAs occurred most frequently in homes/apartments (78.27%&#8212;616 cases). Only about one in ten (9.78%&#8212;77 cases) patients who experienced cardiac arrest were in the street at that time. The remaining cases accounted for 11.94% (94 cases) of all of the locations where cardiac arrest occurred, which included the following areas: Social Welfare Home (12 cases), stairwell (9 cases), store (8 cases), clinic, construction site (6 cases each), hotel (5 cases), basement, sobering-up station, detention center, allotment gardens, park, beach (3 cases each), garage, workplace, sewage treatment plant, car workshop, homeless shelter, transport ambulance (2 cases each), shopping mall, train station, bus station, university (University of Bialystok), dormitory, school, government office, library, city stadium, wedding hall, fruit and vegetable market, convent, hospice, attic, hangar of a former military unit, forest, garbage shelter, and abandoned building/vacant property (1 case each).

Distribution of OHCA Cases by Age and Sex</title><p>The numbers of OHCA cases in a variety of age and sex groups are presented in <xref rid="jcm-13-07765-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. OHCA occurred more frequently in men than in women (62.74%&#8212;490 cases). Just over one-third of the cases (37.26%&#8212;291 cases) occurred in women. In the case of six individuals, data on gender were not provided.</p><p>Cardiac arrests were most common among individuals aged 80&#8211;90 years (26.39%&#8212;205 cases). Cases were slightly less frequent in the 70&#8211;79 years age group (20.31%&#8212;157 cases) and the 60&#8211;69 years age group (19.79%&#8212;153 cases). A total of 103 individuals were aged 50&#8211;59 years, representing 13.32% of all cases. Fewer cardiac arrests were recorded in the following age groups: 40&#8211;49 years (7.37%&#8212;57 cases), over 90 years (6.34%&#8212;49 cases), 30&#8211;39 years (4.14%&#8212;32 cases), and 18&#8211;29 years (1.81%&#8212;14 cases). In 2018 and 2019, there were four cases of OHCA among children (individuals under 18 years of age). Based on the data, it is noteworthy that all of the individuals who experienced OHCA and were over 49 years old accounted for 86.16% of all the cases. In the case of 13 individuals, age was unknown, or their medical documentation lacked information; therefore, we excluded these cases from this analysis.

This investigation indicated that 86.16% of OHCA cases were in people over 49. As shown by the gender and age data, OHCA was more common in males under 80 than women. However, women experienced OHCA more frequently than males around 80 or older. The average age at which OHCA occurred for men was 65.01 years, while for women, it was 75.03 years. In comparison, 41% of all OHCA cases in the UK involve individuals between the ages of 15 and 64, while 57.6% involve patients over the age of 65.

Both studies showed that in Europe, bystanders are increasingly choosing to perform CPR before the arrival of the EMT. The percentage share of bystanders performing CPR in Bialystok may be underestimated, as in 36.85% of the cases, the CPR records did not include the information about the actions taken by the bystander.</p><p>Our study found that bystanders were significantly more likely to perform CPR with chest compressions alone than with chest compressions and rescue breaths. These results were similar to those obtained in the Upper Silesia region [<xref rid="B19-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Performing CPR with chest compressions along with breaths in Europe is undertaken slightly more often than in Poland [<xref rid="B13-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

In 15.91% of cases, the bystanders conducted CPR despite the presence of signs of death. The decision to perform CPR by the bystanders, even in the presence of signs of death, was most likely due to a lack of medical knowledge, nervousness, stress, or the desire to save another person at all costs, even in the face of clear indications against BLS procedures. Nevertheless, it is important to commend those individuals who chose to attempt CPR, even in the cases involving the patients with signs of death.</p><p>Statistically significant higher rates of ROSC and hospital transfer were observed when a bystander initiated CPR. ROSC occurred in 30.53% of patients who had received CPR from a bystander, whereas it occurred in just 2.35% of patients who had not received CPR from a bystander.

The decision of the EMT supervisor to start resuscitation procedures is significantly influenced by whether the bystanders have performed CPR. Among the patients for whom CPR had been administered by a bystander, the EMT initiated resuscitation efforts in 67.89% of the cases, whereas among those where the bystander had not performed CPR, the EMT conducted resuscitation efforts significantly less often, in only 25.82% of the cases.</p><p>The decision to perform CPR by a bystander was influenced, among other factors, by the age of the victim. A statistically significant relationship was found between the age of the victim and the initiation of CPR by the bystander. The older the victim was, the less likely the bystanders were to perform CPR before the ambulance arrived.</p><p>In Bialystok, the total average time from the moment the dispatcher received the call to the arrival of the ambulance at the scene was 8 min and 30 s, with a median of 8 min (Q1 = 6 min, Q3 = 10 min).

The total time that best represents the final arrival time of the ambulance at the scene was likely influenced by several factors, including the correct execution of procedures by the dispatcher, the quality of contact with the person calling for the ambulance, the infrastructure of the ambulance station, the urgency displayed by the ambulance crew, the distance from the ambulance station to the incident location, and the traffic conditions.</p><p>No statistically significant difference was found between the time from the dispatcher&#8217;s receipt of the call to the arrival of the ambulance at the scene and the occurrence of ROSC in the patient.

The average time from the receipt of the call to the arrival of the ambulance at the scene in the cases where ROSC occurred in Bialystok was 8 min and 27 s, while in the cases without ROSC, it was very similar at 8 min and 33 s. It is plausible to state that in other studies conducted in different cities in Poland, that time did not differ significantly, which is why no statistically significant differences have been recorded between the ambulance response time and the occurrence of ROSC in patients.</p><p>In Bialystok, during the initial ECG rhythm assessment performed by the EMT members, asystole was the most common first rhythm of cardiac arrest, followed by PEA, and VF or pVT. In Poland, studies conducted in Opole and Poznan showed similar frequencies of VF/pVT in the first rhythm assessment by the EMT members. The remaining rhythms consisted of asystole and PEA [<xref rid="B23-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A higher percentage of VF or pVT was observed in Katowice [<xref rid="B21-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous research has indicated that the earlier a heart rhythm is assessed in cases of OHCA, the more commonly a defibrillation is required. On average, the AED performed an early cardiac evaluation 3 min and 43 s faster than the EMT. In these cases, VF/VT was most frequently diagnosed [<xref rid="B26-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Among the patients whose first observed rhythm during the ECG analysis was VF or pVT, ROSC was significantly more common as compared to the cases where the first rhythm was PEA or asystole. These findings are comparable with those obtained in Poland in 2018 [<xref rid="B20-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Comparing the occurrence of ROSC among the patients with rhythms requiring defibrillation and other rhythms, a statistically significant relationship was also observed. When the first observed rhythm of cardiac arrest was VF or pVT, ROSC occurred in 58.62% of the cases. In contrast, among other cardiac arrest rhythms (asystole and PEA), ROSC occurred in only 26.56% of the cases. Those results align with the frequency of ROSC based on the first cardiac arrest rhythm observed in Katowice as well as in Europe as a whole [<xref rid="B13-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B21-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>For the group where the first rhythm of cardiac arrest was VF/pVT, the median age was 63 years. In the group where the first rhythm was asystole, the median age was significantly higher at 72 years. The highest median age was observed in the cases where the first rhythm was PEA, with a median age of 75 years.</p><p>Among the patients who experienced OHCA in VF/pVT rhythm, those who had undergone intubation had a statistically significantly lower rate of ROSC as compared to patients who had not undergone that procedure. In the cases of VF/pVT, defibrillation should be performed as a priority, and it should not be delayed [<xref rid="B14-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When VF/pVT is present, the use of alternative airway management methods seems to be more advantageous than performing endotracheal intubation, as the latter procedure takes more time. Among the patients who experienced OHCA in asystole and PEA rhythms, endotracheal intubation did not significantly affect ROSC. In rhythms that do not require defibrillation, such as asystole and PEA, both endotracheal intubation and alternative airway management methods appear to have similar therapeutic significance. According to the guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council, endotracheal intubation should be performed by an experienced individual; in other cases, airway management can be achieved using a supraglottic airway device or a laryngeal mask [<xref rid="B14-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. So far, the analyses of the frequency of ROSC in relation to the performance of endotracheal intubation have primarily focused on all the groups of ECG rhythms without differentiating between those that require defibrillation and those that do not. These studies have shown that performing intubation in cases of OHCA does not significantly impact the occurrence of ROSC [<xref rid="B27-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-jcm-13-07765" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Among the individuals who experienced OHCA in Bialystok, ROSC was achieved in 36.41% of the cases during advanced life support (ALS) provided by the EMT, and the patients were subsequently transferred to hospital.

The analysis included dispatch records of patients who received medical assistance in Bialystok. This study did not cover rural areas, where access to EMTs is limited. In addition, this study did not cover other provincial cities in Poland, which may significantly limit the use of the presented results. Such studies should be conducted in all provincial cities in Poland, so that the results can be used to improve the functioning of the EMS. Another limitation of this study is the inaccurately completed medical documentation. Some cases had to be rejected from the analysis due to insufficient data contained in the rescue cards or their incorrect completion. Meticulous completion of the cards would allow for the analysis of a larger number of cases. Greater emphasis should be placed on training EMTs in the field of maintaining medical documentation, so that it is maintained in a conscientious and unified manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jcm-13-07765"><title>5.

Furthermore, during the occurrence of rhythms such as VF/pVT that require defibrillation, the use of alternative methods for airway management, such as a mask or laryngeal tube, results in a higher occurrence of ROSC.</p><p>To better understand the factors that increase the occurrence of ROSC, continued scientific research on OHCA cases is essential, along with collaboration with international organisations by providing them with the compiled records of those cases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
