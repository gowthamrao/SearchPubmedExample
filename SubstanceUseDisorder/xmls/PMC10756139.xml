Overall, the mean age [standard deviation] was 45.4 [11.0] years; patients were predominantly White (84.5%), male (75.8%), and European (77.6%). Patients with episodic CH reported 17.5 [10.0] attacks/week; patients with chronic CH reported 18.8 [10.2] attacks/week. The average pain severity score (range 0&#8211;4) was 2.5 [0.7] for episodic CH and 2.7 [0.7] for chronic CH. Higher attack frequency was a possible predictor of response to galcanezumab; potential negative predictors of response were greater attack severity and duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This large dataset of patients with CH provides reliable systematically and prospectively collected information on disease characteristics.

The disorder is more prevalent in men than in women; approximately 70% of respondents to recent surveys of individuals with CH were male, and the male-to-female ratio in a recent study conducted at a specialized clinic was 2:1 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Limited studies are available that include prospective recording of baseline CH features from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with larger CH populations. When the studies herein initiated, two RCTs with approximately &#8805;100 patients had been published evaluating sumatriptan (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 168) and sodium valproate (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 96) in the prevention of CH (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The limited number of prospective studies on CH renders the design of clinical trials for this disease problematic, especially when inclusion and exclusion criteria must be clearly defined. This may be one reason for the persistently limited availability of effective drugs to treat this extremely severe and debilitating disease (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, only cross-sectional surveys were available in the literature for large CH populations. For example, in the United States Cluster Headache Survey, 80% of surveyed patients with CH had headaches daily, and the average number of attacks/day experienced by individuals with CH varied widely; however, the survey did not stratify these values as episodic cluster headache (ECH) or chronic cluster headache (CCH) types (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The majority of survey respondents reported one to four attacks/day, and approximately 20% of respondents reported five to eight attacks/day (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In comparison, respondents in the Danish Cluster Headache Study and the Cluster Headache Questionnaire international survey (two additional cross-sectional studies) reported mean averages of 3.6 attacks/day and 3.9 attacks/day, respectively (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). More recently, the prospective, observational Korean Cluster Headache Registry study reported a median (interquartile range) daily attack frequency of 1.1 (1.0&#8211;3.0) among study participants with CH (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), with demonstrated efficacy in migraine (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Two phase 3, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (two of the largest CH trials completed) conducted in Europe and North America assessed the safety and efficacy of galcanezumab vs. placebo in reducing weekly attack frequency in patients with ECH (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02397473">NCT02397473</ext-link>) and CCH (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02438826">NCT02438826</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The primary outcome measure and key secondary measure (weekly frequency of CH attacks and 50% response, respectively) were reached in the ECH study, while the CCH was a negative study. Together, the two trials enrolled a large patient population with a definite diagnosis of ECH or CCH and used electronic diaries to collect prospective data on CH attacks for 7 or 14 days, respectively, before patients were randomized to interventional treatment (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>This report has two objectives: to elucidate prospectively recorded disease characteristics from the largest select population of patients with ECH or CCH to date and to perform a <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis of the ECH trial in an attempt to identify potential predictors of response to galcanezumab.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Methods and materials</title><sec><title>2.1 Study design and patients</title><p>Details of the study designs, objectives, and endpoints of the two trials in populations with episodic and chronic CH have been published previously (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

Key exclusion criteria were the same for the two studies and included current enrollment in another clinical trial; current or previous use of CGRP or nerve growth factor antibodies; suspected presence of another distinct trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia; and lifetime history of migraine variants that could implicate or be confused with ischemia. Patients with serious or unstable medical conditions that would preclude study participation (including but not limited to pregnancy, significant risk of suicide, history of substance abuse, or dependence within the past year, history of stroke, intracranial or carotid aneurysm, recent history of cardiovascular events, or risk for serious cardiovascular events including abnormal electrocardiogram findings) were also excluded. Study patients were allowed concomitant medications for acute or abortive treatment of CH, including high-flow oxygen, oral triptans, sumatriptan SC injections, sumatriptan nasal spray, zolmitriptan nasal spray, acetaminophen, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p><p>Concomitant preventive medications were not permitted in the ECH study. In contrast, up to six concomitant preventive medications were allowed in the CCH study (verapamil &#8804; 480 mg/day, lithium, melatonin, valproate, gabapentin, and topiramate) if the patient was on a stable dose for 2 months prior to the prospective baseline and remained on a stable dose during the double-blind period.</p><p>These studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by each institution's ethical review board.

The following patient demographics and characteristics were recorded at screening for all intent-to-treat patients: age, sex, race, ethnicity, country, region, body mass index, baseline alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and nicotine use and consumption, medical history and pre-existing conditions, lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior, and use of preventive and/or concomitant medications. Data collected during the prospective baseline phase were used to establish the baseline frequency of CH attacks, attack duration, attack severity, and acute/abortive medication use. In the CCH study, data from the electronic case report form were used to evaluate the use of preventive medications (when allowed).</p><p>Patients recorded the number of CH attacks, attack severity/duration, and acute/abortive medications in their electronic patient-reported outcome diary during the prospective baseline and double-blind treatment phases (and through the 1<sup>st</sup> month of the open-label treatment phase for chronic CH). This report focuses on data from the electronic patient-reported outcome diaries from the prospective baseline phase. Information regarding abortive medication use, average CH attack duration, and average CH attack pain severity was also recorded. Regardless of acute medication use, average pain severity during the previous 24-h period was rated using a 5-point pain scale, where 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = severe pain, and 4 = very severe pain (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To determine attack duration, patients answered the following query each day in their electronic patient-reported outcome diary: on average, what was the duration of your CH attack(s) during this 24-h period? Patients were instructed to round up if their average duration was between two of the following choices: 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and &gt;3 h. If the &gt;3-h choice was selected, 4 h was imputed for that 24-h period. To calculate the total daily (24-h) duration, the number of attacks was multiplied by the average duration for that day. If the calculated total daily duration was &gt;24 h, it was set to 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses for baseline demographic and disease state characteristics were conducted on intent-to-treat patients who were randomly assigned to a treatment group and received at least one dose of study drug. Medical history and pre-existing conditions were summarized by preferred term. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency and percent while continuous variables were summarized using mean and standard deviation (SD). All statistical analyses except responder analyses were descriptive in nature, and no formal statistical inferences were conducted. A <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> multiple logistic regression model was conducted to evaluate the association between the 50% response (yes or no) at Week 3 and selected demographic (age &#8805;40 years, European residence, and use of oxygen or SC sumatriptan) and prospective baseline disease characteristics (weekly attack frequency, attack severity, attack duration, and categorical attack frequency &#8804; 4) in the ECH study. The impact of each covariate on the odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) of achieving response vs. non-response was reported for the galcanezumab-treatment group (35 responders and 11 non-responders).

Rates of current alcohol use in these studies were 61% among patients with ECH and 47% among those with CCH. In comparison, the U.S. Cluster Headache Survey study of individuals with CH reported an alcohol intake rate of ~65% (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), while 61% (71% in ECH and 43% in CCH) of respondents in the Danish Cluster Headache Study consumed alcohol (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) (<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Reporting of suicidal ideation or behavior is inconsistent across CH publications. In one survey-based study, 55% of respondents reported lifetime suicidal ideation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which far exceeds the frequencies reported in these ECH (13%) and CCH (23%) studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), although the frequency of suicidal behavior was similar. This difference in the frequency of suicidal ideation could be due to differences in how data were collected. Compared to a self-reported survey, the present studies used the rater-based Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale and patients may have felt more comfortable reporting ideation via a survey.</p><p>The most common comorbidities observed at baseline in the present studies are generally consistent with data reported previously (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Depression and anxiety were reported by patients in both ECH and CCH studies, albeit somewhat more frequently in patients with CCH; insomnia was common in both studies. These psychiatric comorbidities are also frequently reported in other studies, but without differentiation between CH subtypes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Although generally consistent, several conditions related to cardiovascular risk were reported at baseline in the current trials at slightly lower rates than in surveys or population-based studies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The variation in these comorbidities compared with previous literature may be due to differences in the methods and standards used to identify comorbid conditions (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term vs. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision criteria) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), or in collection methods (insurance claims database vs. medical records or survey questionnaires) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Significance of disease characteristics collected prospectively</title><p>The prospective baseline collection of patient-reported CH attack variables and use of acute medications from these ECH and CCH studies provides important longitudinal data for future clinical trial planning in CH. Prospective reporting of CH disease characteristics in RCTs is not universally adopted. A recent review of peer-reviewed publications of preventive RCTs identified nine trials that reported prospective baseline data and seven of these enrolled &#8804; 34 patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the current ECH and CCH studies, the frequency of weekly CH attacks and average daily attack frequency were similar. In contrast, average attack duration and average attack pain severity were numerically higher in the CCH study (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prospective data reported in studies vary in the type and amount included, as shown in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, limiting comparisons across all the variables reported prospectively in the current studies. In general, the number of daily attacks when reported prospectively ranged from one to three, consistent with current studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Interestingly, a lower prospective weekly attack frequency was reported in two prevention studies that failed to meet their primary endpoints: the sodium valproate study by El Amrani et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and a more recent ECH prevention study of fremanezumab that reported a weekly average of 12.7 to 13.3 CH attacks across treatment groups (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Similar prospective mean weekly attack frequencies of approximately 15 and 18 were reported in two small studies of 11 patients each with ECH and refractory CCH, respectively (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>During the prospective baseline, the majority of patients with ECH and CCH reported using SC sumatriptan and oxygen, which was consistent with the higher weekly number of times each of these medications were used compared to other acute treatments (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Patients in the ECH study reported greater use of analgesics such as acetaminophen/paracetamol and NSAIDs compared to CCH and use of oral and intranasal triptans was reported less frequently in both studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, it is noted that oral triptans were not allowed in the original protocol, but were added in a later amendment, limiting the interpretation of their actual use. Oxygen use in our ECH study was less common than in the cohort of patients with ECH in ACT-2, but more common in our CCH study than among patients with CCH in ACT-2 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>4.4 Potential predictors of response</title><p>Potential predictors of response to galcanezumab were evaluated in the current ECH study, given the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a significant mean weekly attack reduction of 3.5 over placebo (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04) and a significantly greater percentage of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in attack frequency (galcanezumab: 71%, placebo: 53%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.046). A <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis of selected demographic and disease state characteristics reported during the prospective baseline period suggested that age &#8805;40 years, European residence, oxygen or SC sumatriptan use, &#8804; 4 CH attacks/day, higher average CH pain severity, and longer average CH attack duration were negative predictors of response, with a stronger association for oxygen or SC sumatriptan use, age &#8805;40 years, and &#8804; 4 attacks/day. The analysis also suggests a higher weekly CH attack frequency is associated with response (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While these data must be interpreted with caution due to their <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> nature and small sample sizes, it is worth noting a higher pain intensity has been reported previously as a predictor of non-response to treatment in patients with medication overuse headache (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, our data need to be confirmed in larger studies of representative and homogenous patient populations where the diurnal pattern is also included, given that nocturnal attacks are reported to be clinically more severe and longer lasting.</p></sec><sec><title>4.5 Limitations and strengths</title><p>The main limitation of these studies is the rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as exclusion of patients with serious or unstable medical conditions that would interfere with study participation, including recent acute cardiovascular events; however, patients with other comorbid diseases were included. Another limitation is that data were not collected regarding whether patients with CCH were newly diagnosed with CCH or transformed from a previous ECH diagnosis; such information might shed additional light on the increased rate of suicidality in patients with CCH. Data on prior bout duration were also not collected, although in the ECH study the duration of prior bouts was required to be &#8805;6 weeks, limiting the analytic comparisons that may have been possible. While consistent with the guidelines for controlled trials in CH, the current ECH study did not allow any preventive medications (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); however, this prohibition may have limited the voluntary participation of patients who had a positive treatment response from available preventive medications. That the two studies were conducted solely in Europe and North America limits generalizability of the findings because several CH characteristics differ between Asian and European/North American patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the findings from the responder analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size of the ECH study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 46 patients: 35 responders and 11 non-responders). Because the CCH study was a negative study, a responder analysis was not conducted to evaluate the association between response status and baseline disease characteristics.</p><p>The main strength of the data presented here is represented by the prospective evaluation of headache characteristics collected using a timestamp electronic diary from a large population spanning multiple countries. Furthermore, the clinical expertise of the enrolling centers strengthens confidence in the correctness of diagnoses compared to survey-based studies. The fact that the demographic data and disease characteristics of this population at baseline were similar to those in prior published studies using various sampling methods suggests that, although highly selected, our study population may be considered representative of the clinical population with CH in Europe and North America.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>The two phase 3, placebo-controlled studies evaluating galcanezumab for CH detailed herein provided the ability to record baseline demographics and clinical characteristics precisely, together with the prospective daily collection of CH attack characteristics and acute medication use in a relatively large population with ECH and CCH. The analysis in patients with ECH underscores potential predictors of response worth considering in the design of future CH trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Eli Lilly and Company provides access to all individual participant data collected during the trial, after anonymization, with the exception of pharmacokinetic or genetic data.
