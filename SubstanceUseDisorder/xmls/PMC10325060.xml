Introduction</title><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves new prescription drugs if the benefits appear to outweigh the risks. However, some new drugs have severe risks for certain populations, such as pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288008.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], while other new drugs have risks that can be reduced with better surveillance, such as regular lab tests [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288008.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To ensure that these drugs can still be FDA-approved and made available for the patients who might benefit from them, Congress gave FDA the authority to require manufacturers to set up risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) programs [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some REMS programs consist of a medication guide and a communication plan to instruct patients and physicians on safe drug use. Others include additional elements to assure safe use (ETASU), which can include patient registries, dispensing restrictions such as requiring evidence that a patient is taking birth control or has received the appropriate screening blood tests, and training and certification of prescribing physicians and dispensing pharmacies [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As of May 24, 2023, 63 FDA-approved drugs or drug classes had REMS programs, of which 59 (94%) had ETASU, while only 2 (3%) had a medication guide and/or a communication guide alone [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite the prevalence of ETASU REMS, in a 2013 report, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General cast doubt on their effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The evidence to date has been mixed. One review of extended-release/long-acting opioids found that between 2012 and 2016 only 28% of prescribers had taken the continuing education tied to the drugs&#8217; ETASU REMS [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, a different study found a lower incidence of opioid overdose among Medicaid beneficiaries following the program&#8217;s implementation (which the authors acknowledge could not be disentangled &#8220;from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals&#8221;) [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Varied findings have also been reported for the impact of ETASU REMS on physician prescribing practices. An investigation of the thrombopoietin-agonist eltrombopag (Promacta) observed decreased off-label use while the drug was covered, although that indication was later FDA-approved [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A study of transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) drugs that were supposed to be restricted to opioid-tolerant patients found that by 60-months post ETASU REMS implementation, 35%-55% of patients met this criterion and 34% of surveyed prescribers had prescribed these drugs inappropriately [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, a separate investigation of Medicare Part D beneficiaries reported that between 2010 and 2014, the TIRF ETASU REMS was associated with a sustained decrease in the percent of prescriptions among patients without known opioid tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Finally, a study of the ETASU REMS for erythropoiesis stimulating agents darbepoetin alfa and epoetin alfa did not find a change in non-evidence-based initiation of either drug following initiation of the program [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Given the uncertainty over the impact of these programs, we sought to better understand physicians&#8217; experiences with and perceptions of the operation of ETASU REMS in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>2. Methods</title><p>We conducted a descriptive phenomenological study, using semi-structured guides to interview a cohort of physicians who prescribed ETASU-REMS covered drugs, and qualitatively analyzed their perceptions and experiences to learn how these programs can be better designed and implemented.</p><p>To select the programs being examined, we ranked all 40 ETASU REMS existing as of January 2016 on the rigor of their requirements, including: (1) prescriber certification (score 0 if no, 1 if yes), (2) monitoring or testing (0 if no, 1 if recommended, 2 if mandated, 3 if data reporting requirements), (3) administration or dispensing restrictions (0 if no, 1 if certification required, 2 if only limited specialty pharmacies or centers could qualify), and (4) manufacturer access to patient health information (0 if no, 1 if yes). We selected four with scores higher than the median: natalizumab (Tysabri), riociguat (Adempas), sodium oxybate (Xyrem), and vigabatrin (Sabril). <xref rid="pone.0288008.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides details on the indications and risks of these drugs, and on their monitoring and testing requirements.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0288008.t001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0288008.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>ETASU REMS-covered study drugs.</title><p>ETASU = elements to assure safe use, PML = progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, REMS = risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, * = Removed in June 2016.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="pone.0288008.t001g" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0288008.t001.jpg"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drug</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Indication</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Risk Prompting ETASU REMS</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Screening/Monitoring or Testing Requirements</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dispensing/Administration Limitations</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data Sharing Statement in Patient Enrollment Agreement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Natalizumab (Tysabri)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crohn&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PML, an opportunistic, often fatal infection caused by the JC virus, the estimated incidence of which is 11/1,000 among individuals with: (1) presence of anti-JC virus antibodies, (2) prior immunosuppressant use, and (3) long-term (&gt;2 years) natalizumab use</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommended monitoring for PML at 3 and 6 months and every 6 months thereafter;

Interview guide, physician recruitment, and conduct of interviews</title><p>We developed a semi-structured interview guide with three primary topics: utility and burden; privacy; and recommended improvements (S1 Appendix in <xref rid="pone.0288008.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). To minimize bias, we posed open-ended questions. We tested the guide in pilot interviews and made minor revisions to it for clarity based on our experiences.</p><p>Eligible participants must have prescribed the drug of interest within two years of their interview. To recruit participants, we identified physicians associated with national patient support groups for diseases treated by the drugs. Aiming to assemble a diverse group, we intentionally sought out physicians from states across the country. Invitation emails to these physicians included a fact sheet providing an overview of the study and its goals.</p><p>Interviews were conducted between 2016 and 2017 by two research assistants, AA (male, BA) and SZD (female, BA), who were trained through practice interviews led by AS (male, PhD/JD). In each interview, the interviewer noted his or her background and spoke alone with the participant. Interviews were approximately one hour, conducted over the phone, recorded, and transcribed. Field notes were taken as needed. Owing to resource constraints, repeat interviews were not conducted, nor were transcripts returned to participants for comment or correction. Participants completing an interview received a $150 gift card honorarium. A target of at least 5 interviews per drug were sought, with interviews stopped once data saturation was reached.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>2.2.

Impact on practice</title><p>The dominant perspective was that the ETASU REMS had limited impact on clinical practice (<xref rid="pone.0288008.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Reasons for this perspective included that participants were already familiar with the benefits and risks of the drug and believed that requirements for educating, consenting, and monitoring or testing patients were steps they would have taken anyway. One participant (physician 27, sodium oxybate) estimated the effect on his willingness to prescribe at &#8220;zero percent,&#8221; while another (physician 3, riociguat) said &#8220;that&#8217;s very much a standard list of things we go through.&#8221; Another participant (physician 26, sodium oxybate) noted, &#8220;I have to say there is nothing that has really popped up in the Xyrem REMS Program where I was like, &#8216;Wow, I would have missed that.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Participants highlighted benefits, such as extra regulatory oversight, which made some more willing to prescribe the covered drugs. One participant (physician 5, riociguat) explained that without its monitoring system and central pharmacy, &#8220;the onus would be upon me and my team to have a more active role&#8221; Another participant (physician 30, sodium oxybate) thought the ETASU REMS encouraged more frequent formalized discussions with patients: &#8220;I&#8217;m more often having discussions, particularly&#8230;about alcohol&#8230;I&#8217;m doing it in a formal way rather than saying it once and assuming that nothing changes and everybody remembers it.&#8221; A second participant (physician 17, natalizumab) commented that this discussion was better &#8220;for the patient and the patient-physician relationship.&#8221; A few participants felt that the ETASU REMS requirements presented minimal hassle. One participant (physician 24, natalizumab) said, &#8220;It virtually takes 60 seconds to do the forms,&#8221; while another commented that the requirements, though time-consuming, were reasonable.</p><p>Several participants, however, questioned whether the ETASU REMS were worthwhile. Some were skeptical that the programs protected safety. One participant (physician 21, natalizumab) observed that although the ETASU REMS required documentation of the completion of monitoring tests, the program did not ensure that the testing was done correctly or that the results were accurate. Many participants also believed that the ETASU REMS imposed burdens on their practice from increased paperwork, patient monitoring or testing, and communication between the practice, pharmacies, and patients. Some participants were bothered by needing to respond to queries about adverse events from the sponsor.

Data collection</title><p>Some participants identified potential benefits of program-related data collection to the field and their practice (<xref rid="pone.0288008.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For example, one participant (physician 23, natalizumab) noted that mandatory data collection meant that the denominator was known. However, many participants expressed some unease about a requirement for patients to grant pharmaceutical manufacturers access to personal health information, which was part of the enrollment forms for natalizumab and vigabatrin. First, some participants argued that pharmaceutical manufacturers were not involved in patient care and that their use of such data would likely not benefit patients. Second, concerns were raised about potential breaches of confidentiality, though one participant (physician 24, natalizumab) noted that since the precedent for data collection by third parties had already been set by insurers, &#8220;whether or not the manufacturer gets this information doesn&#8217;t really matter.&#8221; Finally, some participants recognized the need for limited data collection but were concerned that the patient release statements were unnecessarily broad. Underlying such views was the perception that pharmaceutical companies were using the data for marketing. For example, one participant (physician 6, riociguat) called required data sharing a &#8220;business strategy.&#8221;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The rationale for and requirement of the ETASU REMS were well known by physicians prescribing 4 drugs subject to these requirements. Some physicians reported greater comfort prescribing covered drugs on account of this oversight, and some believed the programs promoted physician-patient discussion. However, concerns were raised about the administration time required for compliance and potential improper use of patient health information.</p><p>Although their primary purpose is to reduce drug risks, ETASU REMS may have other benefits. By promoting better communication with patients, these programs may help strengthen the physician-patient relationship, increasing patient trust and shared decision making. There is some support for this conclusion in the medical literature. In a survey of Kaiser Permanente Southern California health care providers who had prescribed 1 of 21 REMS-covered drugs between January and June 2013, a majority of oncologists, primary care physicians, and other non-pain management or surgical specialists reported that REMS had a moderate or substantial impact on their interactions with patients [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, in our previous study on patient experiences with the same ETASU REMS as in the present study, we found that the programs made some patients more comfortable following their physicians&#8217; advice [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The time and resources needed to meet requirements were a frequent point of discussion in the interviews. The FDA is currently partnering with the MITRE Corporation to develop &#8220;an open source proof-of-concept prototype&#8221; to better integrate REMS programs into existing health information systems and health care delivery processes, including electronic prescribing [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to this initiative, the FDA can require programs to have online data entry portals instead of faxed or mailed submissions, while drug manufacturers can compensate physicians for reporting required clinical information. Such payment would have to be commensurate with effort so as not to create a perverse incentive to prescribe an ETASU REMS-covered drug.</p><p>Steps can also be taken to mitigate concerns raised by physicians about data privacy. These concerns mirrored those expressed by patients [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and can be mitigated by requiring manufacturers to offer clearer explanations about what patient health information can be collected under ETASU REMS, for what purposes, and over what time. Direct FDA administration or required routine third-party audits of these programs might help reassure physicians that the data collected is being properly used for purposes such as pharmacovigilance.</p><p>Limitations of our study include physician participants from just 4 ETASU REMS. However, these programs shared core elements with other programs. Second, most physicians interviewed were from Massachusetts and academic medical centers. Third, our use of patient support groups might have resulted in skewed recruitment of specialists. Their views and experiences therefore may not have been representative of all physicians who prescribe these drugs. Work is currently underway to understand a broader range of physician experiences with REMS programs [<xref rid="pone.0288008.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Our findings suggest that physician knowledge about ETASU REMS was strong. For some physicians, the programs provided reassurance and facilitated discussions about treatment. However, reforms are needed to ensure more efficient implementation and better protection of patient health information.</p></sec><sec id="sec017" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0288008.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0288008.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0288008.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Tkachenko</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Barbieri</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Mostaghimi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>US Food and Drug Administration reports of pregnancy and pregnancy-related events associated with isotretinoin</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">JAMA Dermatol</italic></source>. <year>2019</year>;<volume>155</volume>(<issue>10</issue>):<fpage>1175</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>9</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31314041</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.1388</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC6647001</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Rostas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Gabardi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies: a focus on the mycophenolic acid preparations</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Prog Transplant</italic></source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>24</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>33</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>6</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7182/pit2014521</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24598563</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Mijovic</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <article-title>Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Ann Hematol</italic></source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>99</volume>(<issue>11</issue>):<fpage>2477</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>2482</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s00277-020-04215-y</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32815018</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC7536144</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Parham</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mipomersen and its use in familial hypercholesterolemia</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Expert Opin Pharmacother</italic></source>. <year>2019</year>;<volume>20</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>127</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>131</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/14656566.2018.1550071</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">30526168</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC6438693</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">21 USC &#167; 355&#8211;1.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref006"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Sarpatwari</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Avorn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Kesselheim</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Using a drug-safety tool to prevent competition</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">N Engl J Med</italic></source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>370</volume>(<issue>16</issue>):<fpage>1476</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJMp1400488</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24738666</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0288008.ref007"><label>7</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">US Food and Drug Administration.
