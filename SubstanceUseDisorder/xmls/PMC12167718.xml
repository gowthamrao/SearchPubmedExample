As nonprescribed substance use is common among patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], expert opinion and consensus guidelines strongly recommend routine urine drug testing (UDT) for all patients upon initiation and continuation of opioid therapy for cancer-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. UDT produces objective data on patients&#8217; use of prescribed controlled medications and nonprescribed substances, which can enhance a provider&#8217;s decision-making process by providing information about medication non-adherence and nonprescribed substance use undisclosed by the patient during clinical encounters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite consensus guidelines and potential benefits to therapeutic decision-making, UDT throughout cancer care is rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, there is no consensus on the appropriate timing and frequency of UDT for patients receiving controlled medications for cancer symptom management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations; therefore, screening for SUD is essential in cancer-related pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Survey-based screening tools have been shown to overestimate SUD risk among patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], whereas chromatography-based drug testing, often referred to as confirmatory UDT, is the gold standard for controlled medication monitoring and detection of nonprescribed substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Identification of opioid non-adherence or non-medical opioid use (NMOU) is clinically important as opioid-related harms, such as overdose, occur at a higher rate among patients with both solid-tumor and hematologic malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Compared to oncology providers, palliative care specialists are more likely to order UDTs when prescribing opioids for cancer-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although both specialties routinely prescribe opioids for cancer pain management, differences in opioid-monitoring practices between palliative care and oncology providers have not been elucidated. Through shared clinical workspace, embedded onco-palliative care clinics facilitate closer collaboration between the two specialties as evidenced by increased palliative care referrals and decreased acute healthcare utilization among patients with lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The effect of embedding palliative care in an oncology clinic on guideline-recommended opioid-monitoring practices, including UDT, has not yet been reported.

In a standalone clinic, palliative care visits occur in a different location and often on a different day from the patient&#8217;s oncology appointments. At the time of this study, the standalone palliative clinic operated 5&#160;days/week with three palliative medicine physicians, four certified nurse practitioners, two palliative clinical pharmacists, one social worker, and full-time nursing and scheduling staff.</p><p id="Par11">On September 5, 2018, we opened an embedded palliative care clinic in thoracic medical oncology to provide coordinated oncology and palliative care for patients with advanced thoracic malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At the time of this study, a single palliative care physician saw patients 2&#160;days/week alongside five thoracic oncologists. In this embedded clinic, palliative care providers share workspace, exam rooms, and clinic resources with oncology clinicians, including a social worker, three nurse case managers, and full-time nursing and scheduling staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Palliative clinic UDT protocol</title><p id="Par12">In the standalone palliative clinic, UDT is completed at every patient&#8217;s first palliative clinic visit regardless of risk factors for NMOU or SUD. In the embedded palliative clinic, UDT is completed at a patient&#8217;s first palliative clinic visit unless UDT was ordered by the oncology team within the previous 6&#160;months. For opioid management in both clinics, UDT is repeated every 6&#160;months or sooner per provider discretion. During the post-intervention period, oncology providers could order confirmatory UDT, which was encouraged, but not mandatory, for any patient regardless of palliative care referral status.</p><p id="Par13">In this study, UDT consisted of a two-step process in which urine samples were first tested by screening immunoassay followed by confirmatory gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS, LC&#8211;MS). As immunoassay UDT is prone to false-negative results with an overall sensitivity of 78.5%, automatic reflex of urine samples to GC&#8211;MS/LC&#8211;MS increases the sensitivity of UDT results to 84.6% via this two-step process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All urine samples were sent to an external laboratory for the two-step UDT (Dominion Diagnostic Laboratories, LLC; North Kingston, RI). Laboratory and testing costs are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and in-network private health insurances with no out-of-pocket cost to patients. Samples were tested for amphetamines, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, ethanol, and opioids. Testing for additional substances or medications was available upon request.</p><p id="Par14">Patients with UDT results suggestive of SUD were offered referrals to counseling and treatment resources external to the palliative care clinics. Among patients with unexplained UDT results, UDT was repeated at every palliative clinic appointment until hospice referral, death, discontinuation of palliative care, or loss to follow-up. This testing procedure allowed palliative and oncology providers to closely monitor active nonprescribed substance use and medication non-adherence with the goal of providing patients with additional support during cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interpretation of UDT results</title><p id="Par15">Palliative-trained clinical pharmacists reviewed all unexpected UDT results, reconciled unexpected results with any facility-administered medications or patient-reported last doses of prescribed medications documented in the electronic medical record (EMR), and coded unexpected UDT results as either explained, unexplained, or inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Unexpected UDT results were classified as &#8220;explained&#8221; if a facility-administered or patient-reported medication was not appropriately documented on the testing requisition form. Inconclusive UDT results typically included samples that lacked confirmatory GC&#8211;MS/LC&#8211;MS testing either due to insufficient sample quantity or failure to request confirmatory testing for substances not included in the standard testing panel. Unexplained UDT included results that could not be reasonably explained by medication reconciliation, prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) records, or patient-reported medication use documented in the EMR.</p><p id="Par16">In Ohio, marijuana was legalized for medical use in 2016 prior to the start of the pre-intervention cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, cannabinoids and ethanol were coded as explained UDT results, and patients who tested positive for cannabinoids or ethanol were reported as using non-illicit, nonprescribed substances. Palliative clinical pharmacists sub-coded unexplained UDT results as either absence of a prescribed medication, presence of a nonprescribed substance, or a combination of both absence/presence in the same urine sample. Finally, unexplained results were further coded by drug class, including amphetamines, anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin), benzodiazepines, cocaine, and opioids. Drug classes were not mutually exclusive, as a single urine sample could contain multiple unexplained results (e.g., positive for cocaine and negative for a prescribed opioid). UDT results with no abnormal findings did not require palliative pharmacist review and were coded as &#8220;explained&#8221; by the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par17">Patient demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, and county of residence), cancer diagnosis (non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC] or small-cell lung cancer [SCLC]), and cancer stage at diagnosis (I&#8211;IV) were abstracted from the EMR. Dates of palliative care and oncology appointments, UDT results, last patient contact, and death were also abstracted from the medical record, if applicable. As the Thoracic Oncology Clinic is located in Franklin County, Ohio, patients&#8217; county of residence was further categorized by proximity to the oncology clinic (Franklin County, county adjacent to Franklin County, or county outside both Franklin and the adjacent counties). Palliative care engagement was defined as the number of days between a patient&#8217;s first and last palliative clinic visits up to 24 months after cohort entry. Patients who completed only one palliative care appointment were assigned an engagement time of 1&#160;day. Coding of unexpected UDT results was abstracted through manual chart review of UDT interpretation documented by palliative pharmacists in the EMR.</p><p id="Par18">Differences in demographics and UDT variables between the pre- and post-intervention cohorts were assessed using logistic regression for binary variables, either Fisher&#8217;s exact test or chi-squared tests for categorical variables, and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>-test for continuous variables.

By embedding palliative care, the primary location of UDT shifted from a standalone palliative care clinic to the oncology clinic where patients received cancer treatment. With this shift in testing location, we observed a threefold increase in the number of patients who initiated UDT in the first year of opening an embedded onco-palliative care clinic. While increased use of UDT may be reflective of increased access to outpatient palliative care in the post-intervention cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this is the first study to demonstrate the impact of an embedded palliative care clinic on the timing of UDT relative to death as a competing event among patients with lung cancer.</p><p id="Par25">Beyond diagnosing SUD, the ability of UDT to detect nonprescribed substances and medication non-adherence may be useful in assessing a patient&#8217;s risk for polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, and underutilization of prescribed medications for symptom management. When UDT is driven by palliative care consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], completion of UDT in a standalone palliative clinic depends on whether a patient is willing or able to receive palliative care in a different location from their primary oncology clinic. Our prior research has demonstrated no effect of clinic model, standalone versus embedded, on when a patient is referred to outpatient palliative care after a lung cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, this study shows that pre-cohort patients began UDT at a first palliative care visit in a standalone clinic at a timepoint closer to death compared to post-cohort patients who could complete UDT in the oncology clinic. By waiting for palliative care to initiate UDT in a standalone clinic, there may be delayed recognition of and less opportunity to support patients with active SUD, NMOU, or non-compliance with controlled medications prescribed for symptom management during cancer care.</p><p id="Par26">While there is strong support for drug screening at least once, there is no consensus on repeat testing during opioid therapy for cancer pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. UDT was repeated more frequently in the post-cohort, with patients completing one additional test, on average, compared to pre-cohort subjects. This is most reflective of the longer survival after the first drug test in the post-intervention cohort, which allows for additional time to repeat UDT during the disease course. As the pre-cohort median survival after the first drug test was less than 6&#160;months, patients receiving palliative care in the standalone clinic were less likely to repeat UDT per clinic protocol. In the post-cohort, where about half of patients completed more than one drug test, half of cases of nonprescribed substance use or controlled medication non-adherence were first detected on a post-baseline UDT result. Pre-cohort patients with unexplained UDT results did not repeat testing and rarely followed up with palliative care. By contrast, post-cohort patients with an unexplained UDT result continued to follow with palliative care alongside their oncology team and often demonstrated relapsing substance use throughout cancer care. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of repeated testing for patient safety and that a single drug test is insufficient to monitor for nonprescribed substance use or medication non-adherence for patients receiving opioids for cancer-related pain.</p><p id="Par27">We have previously shown that patients are more likely to be referred for and complete a palliative care consultation when a palliative provider is embedded in an oncology clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, increased UDT in the post-cohort is only partially explained by increased access to palliative care, as more than one-fifth of post-cohort subjects completed UDT without a palliative care consultation. As the proportion of oncologist-initiated UDT is notably higher in this study than previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we hypothesize that the presence of an embedded palliative care physician may have nudged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] oncology providers to utilize UDT through case review, direct communication of unexplained results, and UDT interpretation by palliative clinical pharmacists. In the future, two nudge interventions that hold promise to further expand the use of UDT include (a) order sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], in which the electronic medical record system automatically selects this test whenever an opioid is prescribed while allowing the provider to decline that recommendation, and (b) peer comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], in which providers are given periodic feedback regarding how frequently they order this test relative to similar clinicians&#8217; decisions. Engagement of oncology clinics in drug screening practices is crucial, as patients with nonprescribed substance use or medication non-adherence may be missed by screening protocols that are only employed by palliative care providers.</p><p id="Par28">There were differences, albeit not statistically significant, in types of unexplained UDT results detected between the two cohorts. Opioids&#8212;both the absence of prescribed (non-adherence) and presence of nonprescribed opioids&#8212;contributed most to the unexplained results in both cohorts. Compared to the pre-cohort, unexplained UDT results were more heterogeneous among post-cohort patients. Similar proportions of patients in both cohorts tested positive for cannabinoids, although delineation of whether cannabinoids were obtained through legal dispensaries versus illegal sources was beyond the scope of this study. Alcohol use was detected on UDT only in the post-cohort due to a difference in ethanol testing between the two cohorts. Ethanol metabolites (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate) were added to the testing panel during the post-intervention period, which detects alcohol consumption up to 80 h (3.33 days) prior to urine collection. Although patients are counseled to avoid concomitant use of opioids and alcohol, the clinical significance of modest alcohol consumption with chronic opioid therapy is not well understood.</p><p id="Par29">As this study was conducted at a large academic medical center with robust outpatient palliative care resources, we recognize several limitations that may limit the generalizability of these findings. First, the sample size was small, particularly in the pre-intervention cohort, which decreased the power of the study to detect differences in UDT results between cohorts. Second, we did not calculate the overall proportions of thoracic oncology patients completing UDT (i.e., screening rate) because many patients were followed in the Thoracic Oncology Clinic during both the pre- and post-intervention time periods. To minimize the effect of pre-post cohort overlap, we defined the cohorts based on when a patient&#8217;s first drug test occurred to describe the effect of an embedded onco-palliative care clinic on UDT utilization. As data was only collected on patients completing UDT, this study does not provide any insight on patients who were prescribed opioids without guideline-concordant UDT. While the median time intervals from palliative care referral to first UDT were similar between the cohorts, the survival analysis supports our conclusion that the post-cohort began UDT at an earlier timepoint relative to death. Finally, patient outcomes, including medication changes, after an unexplained UDT result were beyond the scope of this study and are an area of future research. The economic impact and patient acceptance of recurrent UDT are also important factors that need to be considered in the implementation of drug screening during cancer care, which were not explored in this study.</p><p id="Par30">Palliative care is leading the effort in caring for patients with cancer and substance use disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Embedding palliative care in a thoracic oncology clinic facilitated the expansion of UDT for patients with lung cancer in concordance with national consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is a viable strategy to improve patient safety in opioid cancer pain management. Providers must consider the resources needed to support patients who demonstrate nonprescribed substance use or medication non-adherence detected via confirmatory UDT. This study highlights how UDT, implemented in a thoracic medical oncology clinic, can identify nonprescribed substance use or medication non-adherence earlier in a patient&#8217;s disease course compared to UDT in a standalone palliative care clinic. Early detection is the first step in helping clinicians to better support patients facing SUD, NMOU, or medication non-adherence during cancer care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Vicki Lippert, who gave a donation to support research in the Thoracic Oncology-Palliative Care Clinic.
