priority. Opioid-related mortality reached an all-time high in 2021, exceeding 80&#8201;000
deaths.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In 2020,
approximately 2.5 million people met diagnostic criteria for OUD, but only 11.2% received
any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8211;approved medications for OUD (MOUD), including
buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable naltrexone.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Medications for OUD are associated with significant
reductions in opioid use and fatal overdose, reductions in health care utilization related
to opioid use, and increases in treatment retention rates.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Medicaid is a key policy lever to improve OUD treatment because it covers approximately 40%
of Americans with OUD. However, previous research has revealed wide state variation in
benefits for OUD treatment across Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) programs.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Such variation in OUD treatment benefit design, including MOUD, may lead
to differences in patient access to treatment and health outcomes for Medicaid enrollees
with OUD.</p><p>Although the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment
for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act) of 2018 requires that all Medicaid plans
provide coverage for MOUD as of January 2020, it does not prohibit utilization management
policies, such as prior authorization (PA).<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Prior authorization
is primarily used by insurers as a cost control mechanism. This tool may be particularly
important for administration of state Medicaid programs because Medicaid is consistently the
most expensive item in state budgets. However, payers have also relied on PA to ensure
appropriate use of care. For example, a recent study of 2 state Medicaid programs that
completely removed PA on buprenorphine for OUD found an increase in buprenorphine
prescribing in Illinois but no difference in prescribing after PA removal in
California.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>This mixed result is important because although use of PA to control costs and limit
unnecessary care can be effective, it can also unnecessarily restrict access to MOUD if its
use denies necessary care or if PA decisions take too long and the opportunity for care
engagement is lost. Many other studies identify the use of PA as a barrier to timely receipt
of MOUD and continuity of care.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Removal of PA in Medicare Part D plans, following an
FDA labeling change for buprenorphine products and related Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance,<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> was associated with an increase in prescribing of buprenorphine and
naloxone and a decrease in substance use disorder&#8211;related inpatient admissions and
emergency department visits.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
Relatedly, removal of PA for MOUD was associated with a decrease in the likelihood of
relapse among patients with OUD enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Research also shows that specialty
substance use disorder treatment programs are less likely to offer buprenorphine in states
where Medicaid FFS programs impose PA on the medication.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Prior authorization is also identified as a major
barrier by buprenorphine prescribers serving Medicaid enrollees.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Although there is documentation of widespread use of PA for MOUD in Medicaid FFS programs
in 2017,<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> little is known about
MOUD coverage and PA policies in comprehensive Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
plans, which cover approximately 70% of all Medicaid beneficiaries.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> A comparison of PA policies in
Medicaid FFS programs and MCO plans in 3 states found variation in the use of PA for
MOUD,<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> suggesting that
additional research in this area is warranted. To address this gap in the literature, this
study uses publicly available documentation from all Medicaid comprehensive MCOs to compare
coverage and PA policies for buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable naltrexone across
Medicaid MCO plans and FFS programs as well as across states.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-AOI220074"><title>Methods</title><sec id="H2-1-AOI220074"><title>Study Design and Data</title><p>In this cross-sectional study, we conducted a content analysis of all 266 Medicaid MCO
plans that had active contracts in 38 states and the District of Columbia in 2018. We
reviewed publicly available documentation on benefits and PA policies for buprenorphine,
methadone, and injectable naltrexone. Documents reviewed were member handbooks, provider
manuals, and prescription drug formularies. When multiple plans were available for
different enrollee groups within a single MCO, we selected the largest comprehensive plan
that served adult, nonelderly (aged 18-64 years) enrollees. The study was limited to
comprehensive MCO plans and did not include primary care case management plans.</p><p>A search protocol (detailed in the Measures section) was used to collect MCO plan
documents, which were reviewed and coded by trained research assistants. The research
assistants met weekly with the research team to discuss coding decisions. All coding
discrepancies were resolved through consultation with the research team. A doctorate-level
research assistant was responsible for cleaning the data for analyses (M.M.W.). The
University of Chicago&#8217;s institutional review board approved this study and waived
the requirement for informed consent because non&#8211;human participant data were used.
The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p></sec><sec id="H2-2-AOI220074"><title>Measures</title><p>Buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable naltrexone were coded as covered if an MCO plan
reported covering the medication in either its enrollee or provider handbook or if the
medication was listed in its formulary. For each medication, plans were coded as imposing
PA if the plan mentioned the need for PA in the member handbook, as a requirement for
medication reimbursement in the provider handbook, or as a requirement in its
formulary.</p><p>Coverage data for buprenorphine and injectable naltrexone were not specified for 1 MCO
plan; there were no missing coverage data for methadone. Information on PA was not
specified in 30 MCO plans for methadone, 5 plans for buprenorphine, and 1 plan for
injectable naltrexone. We excluded from analyses all MCO plans for which coverage
information was missing (1 plan for buprenorphine and injectable naltrexone) and/or PA
information was not specified (30 plans for methadone, 5 plans for buprenorphine, and 1
plan for injectable naltrexone). Twelve states (11 for methadone and 1 for buprenorphine)
with more than 50% of information not specified for PA were categorized as not specified.
Of note, although we were unable to categorize these MCO plans&#8217; PA policies,
&#8220;not specified&#8221; is important because an individual with OUD who wanted to
understand the details of a plan&#8217;s MOUD benefits would be unable to locate that
information in the enrollee or provider handbook or formulary.</p></sec><sec id="H2-3-AOI220074"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We compared MCO medication benefits with those specified by Medicaid FFS programs using
FFS data from a survey of state Medicaid agencies conducted from May to December
2017.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The current analysis
was performed from January 1 through May 31, 2022.</p><p>Several measures of MOUD coverage and PA policies were constructed. First, for each
medication (buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable naltrexone), we calculated the
percentage of Medicaid MCO plans and FFS programs that (1) covered the medication without
PA, (2) covered the medication with PA, and (3) did not cover the medication. Second, we
used enrollment data from CMS<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
to calculate the percentage of MCO, FFS, and all (MCO and FFS) beneficiaries who were (1)
covered with no PA, (2) covered with PA, and (3) not covered. Third, to capture state
variation in MOUD coverage and PA policies, we mapped the percentage of MCO plans covering
each medication and the percentage of MCO plans requiring PA by state. Fourth, we mapped
the percentage of all Medicaid beneficiaries (MCO and FFS) enrolled in a plan covering
each medication and the percentage of all beneficiaries subject to PA for each medication
by state. Analyses were performed using Stata, version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-AOI220074"><title>Results</title><sec id="H2-4-AOI220074"><title>Medicaid MCO Plan vs FFS Program Coverage and PA Policies for MOUD</title><p>This study examined coverage and PA policies in 266 MCO plans and 39 Medicaid FFS

MOUD benefit designs in state Medicaid programs. To our knowledge, this study is the first
on a national level to investigate MOUD coverage and PA policies for all 3 FDA-approved
MOUDs in Medicaid MCO plans and FFS programs. The findings reveal key differences in both
MOUD coverage and PA policies between MCO plans and FFS programs. Importantly, we also found
that approximately one-half of all Medicaid beneficiaries (MCO and FFS) had MOUD coverage
that required PA.</p><p>Overall, Medicaid FFS programs have more generous MOUD coverage; however, a majority of
beneficiaries (approximately 70%) are enrolled in Medicaid MCO plans.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In addition, although a higher
percentage of state Medicaid FFS programs than MCO plans impose PA on MOUD, this affects a
small proportion of all Medicaid enrollees (ranging from 12.1% of enrollees for methadone to
21.3% for injectable naltrexone) because the total number of beneficiaries enrolled in FFS
programs is relatively small compared with enrollment in Medicaid MCO plans.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The SUPPORT Act is expected to address inequities in coverage of MOUD across Medicaid MCO
plans and FFS programs by requiring all plans to cover buprenorphine, injectable naltrexone,
and methadone. However, the legislation does not address the use of PA and other utilization
management strategies. Thus, it is possible that state Medicaid FFS programs and MCO plans
could increase their use of such policies to reduce the costs associated with newly covering
these medications. To date, compliance with the SUPPORT Act and whether all Medicaid plans
now cover buprenorphine, methadone, and injectable naltrexone have not been studied.
Importantly, the current study provides a baseline (before the SUPPORT Act) measure of MOUD
coverage in both Medicaid FFS programs and MCO plans.</p><p>Since 2018, the District of Columbia and 8 states in our study have passed legislation that
places some limits on the use of PA in their state Medicaid FFS programs for at least some
MOUDs.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Of these states, only 3 have completely removed PA
policies for MOUD, and only 1 state law explicitly restricts the use of PA in Medicaid MCO
plans (Colorado). However, in 2018, no comprehensive MCO plans in Colorado required PA.
These differences in state approaches highlight variations in PA policies more generally.
Prior authorization policies can be used for certain groups of enrollees, for certain
dosages, or at different points along the treatment continuum.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> For example, some policies require PA only at the
time of the initial prescription, whereas others also require PA at subsequent dosing
periods. Such variations in PA policy could have important differential effects on the OUD
cascade of care and related health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> For example, policies that require PA at the time of the initial
prescription may delay time to treatment initiation, whereas policies requiring PA beyond
the initial dose may disrupt treatment, thereby possibly affecting retention in care and
ultimately remission and recovery. Additional research is needed to document with greater
specificity these variations among PA policies and then to determine whether variations in
PA policies are associated with the OUD cascade of care.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><sec id="H2-9-AOI220074"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, we compared FFS program survey data collected
in the latter half of 2017 with MCO plan data for calendar year 2018. It is possible that
some state Medicaid FFS programs may have altered their medication benefits during 2018.
Second, PA information was not specified in 30 MCO plans for methadone and 5 for
buprenorphine; thus, we were not able to include 11 states in our analyses of PA policies
for methadone and 1 state for buprenorphine. However, because these data are not publicly
available, this limitation also highlights the need for MCOs to disclose their PA
policies. Third, our data predate important policy changes under the SUPPORT Act (which
requires coverage of all FDA-approved MOUD by state Medicaid programs) and the enactment
of some state laws restricting the use of PA for MOUD in Medicaid MCO plans. However, this
study provides a baseline to assess the association of these policies with changes in
coverage and PA policies in Medicaid FFS programs and MCO plans.</p><p>Fourth, we were unable to identify variation in PA policies beyond a yes/no
classification. As described earlier, studies that investigated state legislation designed
to place limits on PA in Medicaid found variation in these policies, particularly with
regard to whether states have completely removed PA or partially removed PA for
MOUD.<sup><xref rid="aoi220074r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="aoi220074r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This level of detail was not collected in the
Medicaid FFS survey data used in this study and was not available in the majority of MCO
plan documents we reviewed. Further, we did not examine why variation in financing
policies exists across states and in FFS programs vs MCO plans. Differences in coverage
and PA policies may be attributed to a range of factors, including differences associated
with patient selection into plans, regulations governing FFS programs vs MCO plans, state
political environments, and other state MOUD policies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI220074"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the findings from this cross-sectional study suggest that Medicaid
beneficiaries&#8217; access to MOUD may be heavily influenced by their state of residence
and the particular Medicaid plan in which they are enrolled. Thus, state Medicaid agencies
should consider reviewing their contractual agreements with MCO plans to ensure appropriate
coverage and use of PA that is consistent with best existing clinical guidance. In addition,
CMS should consider issuing guidance to support the removal of PA for MOUD in all Medicaid
plans (MCO and FFS) as it has done for the Medicare program. Finally, more states should
consider passing legislation that limits the use of PA for MOUD in their Medicaid programs.
Left unaddressed, PA policies are likely to remain a critical barrier to MOUD access in the
nation&#8217;s Medicaid programs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI220074"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi220074r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage">U.S. overdose deaths in 2021 increased half as much
