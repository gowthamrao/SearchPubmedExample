All adult inpatients in this hospital were screened from January to March 2020, 251 of whom were identified as long-stay inpatients with SCZ (LSIS) and 224 as short-stay inpatients with SCZ (SSIS). Demographic and clinical information of the two groups was collected through medical records, scale assessments and interviews. Gender differences were analyzed, and independent correlates of long-stay between genders were explored by logistic regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to SSIS, greater proportions of LSIS patients were male (64.1%), single (82.1%), unemployed (81.7%) and had no family caregivers (54.2%). For LSIS per se, proportionally more males were single (88.8%), had no family caregiver (65.8%), had concomitant physical disease (65.2%) and had a history of hazardous behavior (27.3%) than their female counterparts.

Deinstitutionalization has been implemented in many countries and has aided the transition of long-stay inpatients to community facilities, which is of help for the rehabilitation of social functioning, reduction of stigma, improvement of well-being and improvement of quality of life [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, deinstitutionalization may promote the rapid and comprehensive development of community-based mental health care. However, the process of deinstitutionalization in East and Southeast Asia is much slower. For instance, in China, the mental health care system remains hospital-based [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the total number of psychiatric beds in China has increased significantly in recent years [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More specifically, this figure in 2016 was double that in 2002. This phenomenon not only shows that the Chinese government is paying more attention to mental health but also indicates that psychiatric deinstitutionalization in China may face major challenges, among which a high rate of long-term hospitalization may have played an important role.</p><p id="p0015">Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) are the leading long-stay inpatients in China. SCZ affects &#8764;1% of the total population [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and accounts for more than half of long-term hospitalized patients with mental disorders [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This could be because SCZ is a chronic, debilitating and disabling disease. As reported in previous studies, up to 20%&#8211;60% of SCZ patients are treatment resistant and eventually become mentally disabled [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, evidence has also indicated that not all long-stay SCZ patients truly need such long-term hospitalization. As reported by a large sample-size study carried out in Japan, nearly 40% of SCZ inpatients hospitalized for &#8805;1 year were judged to have the possibility of being discharged and treated using community-based mental health care [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, apart from the disease itself, there may also be reasons for the high long-term hospitalization rate of SCZ patients.</p><p id="p0020">Risk factors for long-term hospitalization of SCZ patients have been studied for years; yet studies have yielded inconsistent results thus far. Some researchers have recognized that certain clinical features are of particular relevance, mainly including severe negative symptoms, poor self-care ability, and violent behavior [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Others hypothesize that some nonclinical factors play a role as well, such as older age, having medical insurance [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and a shortage of family support and community services [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Notably, previous studies on this topic were rarely conducted in China, although China may have the largest number of patients with SCZ worldwide. In addition, China has a unique sociocultural background that might also influence long-term hospitalization; therefore, the results from other countries may not be generalizable [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">When exploring the reasons and risk factors for long-term hospitalization, the gender gap is another issue worthy of attention. For example, male patients are more likely to have an earlier onset age and present more disorganized and negative symptoms; men tend to have greater social impairment and are more inclined to exhibit relatively poorer treatment response and prognosis [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, males pose much higher risk of violence than females [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. From this point of view, it is warranted to explore the factors associated with long-term hospitalization in SCZ from a gender-based perspective. Evidence has already shown that, in general, women tend to have fewer hospitalizations and shorter lengths of stay [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, we also noticed that timely discharge of male SCZ patients in China was more difficult and slower than that of their female counterparts [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, as far as we know, there is no research focusing on the independent risk factors for long-term hospitalization in SCZ from the perspective of gender differences.</p><p id="p0030">For the above reasons, we carried out the present study. We set out to investigate the characteristics of long-stay patients with SCZ in China, especially emphasizing the sex difference. We hypothesized that the independent correlates of long-term hospitalization may differ between male and female patients. More specifically, the timely discharge of male patients is more affected by non-clinical factors than that of females. Clarifying this gender difference is helpful to better formulate service strategies for this population, thus helping to reduce unnecessary waste of medical resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0035">This is a single-center cluster sampling cross-sectional study carried out in the Affiliated Mental Health Center of Jiangnan University, i.e., Wuxi Mental Health Center (WMHC).

Those who met the following criteria were defined as LSIS in the present study: (1) first diagnosis was schizophrenia according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; (2) aged 18&#8211;65 years old; and (3) hospitalized for no less than 12 successive months. For comparisons, inpatients who met the following criteria were defined as having SSIS: (1) diagnosed with schizophrenia according to ICD-10; (2) aged 18&#8211;65 years old; and (3) discharged with psychiatrist approval and a length of stay (LOS) of no more than 3 months [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We excluded those subjects whose information needed was unavailable or could not be verified (e.g. vagrant patient) and whose LOS was less than 72&#160;h.</p><p id="p0045">Considering that one of our main concerns was the correlation of timely discharge, patients over 65 years old were not included in this study, because their long-term hospitalizations are often more related to comorbidities and complications. Similarly, those with schizophrenia hospitalized for serious medical conditions (e.g. cancer) and those convicted of compulsory medical treatment for committing crimes were also excluded. Patients, who were able to comprehend and provide written informed consent and those without any impairment in communication at the point of recruitment, were recruited into the study. Ultimately, 475 adult patients with SCZ (192 women and 283 men) were enrolled, with a mean age of 48.20&#160;&#177;&#160;11.67 years, and a mean age of onset of 27.08&#160;&#177;&#160;9.05 years (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>, %).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Variable</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">All (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;475)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">LSIS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;251)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">SSIS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#160;=&#160;224)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">x</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic toggle="yes">t</italic></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold><italic toggle="yes">Demographic characteristics</italic></bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Male</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">283 (59.6)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">161 (64.1)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">122 (54.5)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4.605</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>0.032</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age range (years)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">18&#8211;65</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">22&#8211;65</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">18&#8211;65</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8211;</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>--</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Average age (years)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">48.20&#160;&#177;&#160;11.67</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">52.66&#160;&#177;&#160;10.11</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">43.21&#160;&#177;&#160;11.29</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8722;9.626</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt;

Data were mainly collected through the electronic medical record system for inpatients, and confirmed with the patients or their families when necessary. Two aspects of data were collected, of which demographic information included sex, age, educational level, marital status, employment status before admission, guardian or family caregiver, and types of medical insurance. Clinical information included subtype of SCZ, age of onset, date of the present admission, medication used, concomitant physical disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension) and hazardous behavior (i.e. violent assault, suicidal or severe self-harm behaviors) at admission or during hospitalization. For the protection of privacy, all subjects' names were not collected, but the unique numbers of medical records were used for data collection and verification. Global Assessment of Function (GAF) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was employed to evaluate patients' severity of mental symptoms as well as the levels of social and occupational functions. The total GAF score ranges from 0 to 100, and the higher the score is, the better the global functioning. GAF was assessed by a senior psychiatrist together with a psychiatric nurse with knowledge of the patients via a face-to-face interview. For LSIS, these assessments were carried out on a ward-by-ward basis; for SSIS, GAF assessments were performed immediately before discharge to reconfirm that the patient did not belong to the LSIS cohort.</p><p id="p0055">Retrieved data were recorded independently by two researchers using EpiData 3.1 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epidata.dk/" id="intref0015">http://www.epidata.dk/</ext-link>).

We found that more long-stay SCZ inpatients were males, and socially disadvantaged, such as being single, older and lacking family caregiving, which contributed more to long-term stay than disease severity. Analyses by gender showed that for females, risk factors included poor GAF, older age and single status. Older age and poor GAF also played a role in long-term stay for males, however, the most important independent variable for them was having no family caregivers.</p><p id="p0130">Long-term hospitalization remains a very common phenomenon for patients with SCZ in China [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, there is evidence that such a long stay has not only caused a heavy economic burden on medical healthcare [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but also maybe unnecessary in practice [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recently, we found that male SCZ inpatients had significantly longer hospitalization periods than females, despite their severity of illness and overall function being comparable [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results of the present study indicate that several factors beyond illness severity have contributed to the long-term hospitalization of Chinese SCZ patients; more frankly, having no place to go may be a key obstacle for many patients even if their symptoms were significantly improved. Lower GAF scores and/or older age, which usually represent more severe mental symptoms and/or poorer social functioning that hinder the discharge of SCZ patients [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], were replicated in the present study regardless of the overall analysis or subgroup analysis. Notably, not all LSIS patients have poor GAF or are older. In our data, more than a quarter of samples had a GAF score above 60 and patient age less than 40, indicating that some factors other than disease severity or functional defects also played a crucial role, which is in line with our hypothesis. Trieman and colleagues reported gender as a noteworthy factor associated with the degree of difficulty of discharging patients [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, despite overlaps, our data also suggest an obvious gender gap with respect to independent correlates of long stay. Subgroup analysis by sex shows that the most important nonclinical factor for female patients is marital status at admission, while for men, it is having no family caregivers.</p><p id="p0135">In our sample, 70% of female LSIS patients were single, which is much higher than their counterparts in the SSIS group. Unfortunately, being single increased the risk for long-term hospitalization by approximately 4-fold for this population. In other words, if female patients can get married before they get sick, they may be less likely to be left in the hospital for a long time after suffering from schizophrenia. Interestingly, the situation is not the same for men. Although the proportion of men who are single is higher, being single is not a significant independent risk factor for their long-term hospitalization because they may be in a more disadvantageous situation. As shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, for those in the LSIS cohort, the proportion of males reported as &#8220;single&#8221; was just slightly higher than that of females (88.8% vs. 70%); however, the proportion of &#8220;no family caregiver&#8221; in males was double that in females (65.8% vs. 33.3%), which means that male patients are more likely to be abandoned by their families, not only including their spouse (if present), but also other family members. This dilemma may be caused by a variety of reasons. As we know, the male-biased sex ratio in China has resulted in numerous &#8220;surplus&#8221; men even among the general population in recent decades [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and onset ages of SCZ in men are usually earlier than in women: therefore, men usually get sick before they get married [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Due to the previous &#8220;only one child&#8221; policy in China, many people have no siblings and therefore no nephew or niece. In addition, social stigma toward men with SCZ is more common, as male patients tend to display more aggressive and violent behaviors toward the public [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This might greatly weaken the willingness of their family members (if any) to take care of the discharged patients. Eventually, many patients are hospitalized long-term, mainly due to a shortage of effective external support.</p><p id="p0140">Other factors that are considered reasons for long-term hospitalization are not supported in the present study. For example, in the study by Tulloch and colleagues [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], violent behaviors were the second largest risk factor, just after the severity of disease. Nevertheless, this variable failed to pass the multiple comparison in our final model, indicating that it might play a limited role compared with the above mentioned factors. In addition to the medical insurance associated with long stays [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], community placement is also an important factor that cannot be ignored in the successful discharge of patients with SCZ [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Community support for SCZ patients is still limited in China, although this issue has received increasing attention in recent years. Distinctions between this study and previous ones may be due to the differences in the sample's race composition, social and cultural backgrounds, etc., or may be related to the fact that previous studies did not conduct the subgroup analysis by sex, which further demonstrates the necessity of the present study and further research on this topic in different populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0145">There are several limitations of this study. First, this is a cross-sectional study, and by default, it is unable to establish causality; therefore, our results may not directly translate to clinical strategic decisions. Second, this is a single-center study that only collected samples from a large psychiatric hospital. In addition, long-term hospitalization may also be affected by more factors than we investigated in the present study, such as family stigma, family members' income and employment, size of community, community placements, etc. Moreover, there could be some interactions among the variables defined in this study, although no collinearity was detected. Therefore, our findings need to be further verified by multicenter and large-sample studies, and caution should be taken when generalizing the results of the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0150">Despite the above shortcomings, as far as we know, our study is the first to systematically examine the characteristics and gender gap of long-term hospitalized SCZ patients in China. Our findings suggested that some nonclinical factors may exert greater impacts on long stay than disease severity; we also revealed gender overlaps and differences in independent correlates of long stay in this population, which would have helped to better formulate better service strategies for long-stay SCZ patients and reduce unnecessary waste of medical resources.
