It is challenging to achieve optimal postoperative pain management for individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, particularly during the first 24&#160;h after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, a multimodal pain management approach is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Acupuncture may be regarded as a reflex therapy, as it involves eliciting vegetative reflexes via acupoints on the skin. These acupoints are located on meridians, which are neurosensory organs involved in homeostatic vegetative regulation of the body. Stimulating acupoints can lead to functional changes in tissues along the meridian, including the skin, underlying muscles and joints, and other tissues, that are essential for the treatment of various conditions, such as wound pain (e.g., in sutures) or posttraumatic pain. Functional modulation also occurs in symptomatic regions of the viscera, such as peristalsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Acupuncture (AC) has become an increasingly popular strategy for treating acute and chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the process of selecting acupoints for specific patterns of complaints is essential for the success of AC treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and enhances efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, personalized allocation of AC points should be performed in an effective and rationally accessible theoretical framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">We developed a novel model to evaluate abdominal dysfunction by comparing pressure sensitivity at defined visceral points: Gastro 1&#8211;Gastro 6 (G1&#8211;G6). The diagnostic usage of pressure points has a long history in surgery as well as in Chinese medicine. The most well-known point for appendicitis in modern medicine is the McBurney point.</p><p id="Par9">We identified six abdominal points located at key regions of control of gastrointestinal peristaltic movement and digestion (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also manually compared pressure sensitivity within these visceral pressure points to identify the predominantly painful pressure point (ppp), and a set of suitable acupoints was then selected.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Locations of visceral checkpoints: G1&#8211;G6. G1 is located above the sphincter Oddi. G2 is above the pylorus (G2). The gastric fundus (G3) and cardia (G5) are located on the midline.

To date, this system is routinely used to treat various abdominal conditions, such as irritable bowel disease and food intolerance, based on the assumption that the complaints are predominantly based on dysfunctional vegetative symptoms. Since GI dysfunctions are often associated with disorders of the autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and pain is moderated by the autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], it is conceivable that acupuncture techniques, which are sufficient for treating GI dysfunctions, might also have an impact on postoperative pain treatment.</p><p id="Par11">To verify the applicability of the concept of checkpoint acupuncture in patients after bariatric surgery, we conducted this trial to evaluate its analgesic effect in the postoperative course.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par12">This study used a prospective, single-blinded, cohort design to investigate the effects of acupuncture treatment in patients after bariatric surgery. Acupuncture was performed in addition to postoperative standard care, including pain control treatment. Informed consent was obtained prior to enrollment in accordance with a clinical trial protocol approved by the local Ethical Committee. The study was conducted at a university hospital and registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00025579).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p id="Par13">Adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery were screened consecutively.

Patients with needle phobia, previous experience with postoperative acupuncture, chronic pain syndrome prior to surgery, polyneuropathy, relevant coagulation disorders, impaired mental state, or poor communication skills were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intraoperative Standard Care</title><p id="Par14">All patients received a standardized anesthesia with a multimodal analgesia technique. Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil (0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;mg/kg), propofol (1.5&#8211;2.0&#160;mg/kg), and esketamine (0.5&#160;mg/kg) and maintained with continuous infusion of propofol an esketamine. Patients received metamizole and a prophylactic anti-emetic therapy consisting of dexamethasone 8&#160;mg i.v. and granisetron 1&#160;mg i.v. Supplemental intraoperative analgesia was provided using sufentanil or esketamine at the discretion of the attending anesthetist.</p><p id="Par15">All patients underwent surgical site infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine at the beginning of surgery. A 1-cm skin incision was made 15&#160;cm below the xiphoid paramedian-left. The first 12-mm optical trocar was then inserted through this incision under visual control. The constriction of the pneumoperitoneum was 12&#160;mmHg. Additional 12-mm disposable trocars were inserted in the left upper abdomen at the mammillary line and in the right upper abdomen at the mammillary line. A 5-mm trocar was inserted on the left below the costal arch and anterior axillary line. Using a subxiphoid incision, another 5-mm trocar was set, through which the left liver was lifted ventrally using forceps.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Surgical Interventions</title><p id="Par16">According to our internal hospital indication guidelines, RYGB was recommended if gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was diagnosed previously.

The first-line rescue analgesic was an opioid such as controlled-release oxycodone with naloxone (oral 20&#160;mg/10&#160;mg every 12&#160;h). The second-line rescue analgesic was immediate-release oxycodone (oral 10&#160;mg, maximally every 6&#160;h). Antiemetics were administered on demand. After surgery, clear fluids were allowed if patients denied nausea and vomiting. On the following day, patients started with a fluid diet including clear fluids and protein shakes. They were discharged from the hospital on the second day after surgery if they did not show any signs of complications such as bleeding or leakage of the gastrointestinal tract, tolerated the fluid diet (at least 1 L per day), and had well-controlled pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title><p id="Par18">The intensity of subjective pain&#8212;ranging across a continuum from none (0) to an extreme intensity of the pain (10)&#8212;was assessed immediately before AC and at 5&#160;min, 1&#160;h, and 24&#160;h after AC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Predominant Pressure Point (ppp)</title><p id="Par19">The most sensitive pressure point (ppp) was identified by comparing the sensitivity at all abdominal checkpoints (compare Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Location of G1&#8211;G6 points and their corresponding anatomic structures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G-syndrome</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Orientation by Western surface anatomy</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Orientation by acupoints</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Target region</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">At the level of the navel, and the middle of the rectus sheath</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">St25*</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sphincter Oddi</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sphincter Oddi</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">On the midline of the abdomen, between G3 and the navel</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ren 10*</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pylorus</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Pylorus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G3</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">On the midline of the abdomen, in between the navel and the xiphoid process</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ren 12*</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gastric corpus</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Gastric corpus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G4</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Under the costal arch, in the mid-clavicular line</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gb 24</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gallbladder</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Gallbladder</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G5</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Under the xiphoid process</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ren 15</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Antrum and His angle</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Antrum and His angle</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">G6</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">On the lateral rim of the rectus sheath, on the level of the tendinous inscription below the navel</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Between L13-L14</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ileocecal valve</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Terminal ileum appr</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Meridians <italic toggle="yes">Gb</italic>, gall bladder; <italic toggle="yes">St</italic>, stomach; <italic toggle="yes">Ren</italic>, ren mai; <italic toggle="yes">*</italic>, mu points (alarm points) according to Ancient Chinese theory</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Reasoning for AC Selection</title><p id="Par20">The abdominal checkpoints are target regions to be palpated from the exterior to explore the functional state of the corresponding anatomical regions and their structures (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Palpation of these target regions is comparable to some clinical examination techniques of Western medicine, such as Murphy&#8217;s or McBurney&#8217;s sign. To date, abdominal checkpoints are an extension of western palpatory examination routines. Both examples include localization of their target region by certain orientation points of surface anatomy. The anatomic orientation points for the abdominal checkpoints are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par21">It is noteworthy that palpation of the depth of the abdominal cavity is uncommon in traditional diagnostics, so to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on our target regions in the TCM literature. The underlying traditional concepts are not even based on clear anatomic knowledge. Traditional palpatory concepts therefore focus on pulse diagnosis and tender regions of the dermis and subcutis, i.e., the so-called &#8220;surface&#8221; (defined as skin and meridians). Some of these points are referred to as trigger points or &#8220;alarm points&#8221; and are of diagnostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">However, abdominal checkpoints can also be localized via topologic orientation through acupoints, which are abundantly present on the abdomen (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">The target regions of the visceral G points were first observed by medical doctors in patients with a variety of functional abdominal problems in an outpatient clinic. They observed that the pressure sensitivity of these target regions may be an important clue for the individual discrimination of disease patterns and the individual selection of acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Temperature elevation in G1, G3, and G4 might therefore be connected to pain relief by changes in microcirculation at these points as a sign of different types of vegetative reactions to AC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">In this pilot study, we examined the efficiency of abdominal checkpoint acupuncture as analgesic treatment after bariatric surgery. Our results clearly demonstrated a marked pain reduction after AC, which lasted for at least 24&#160;h after the treatment. We also confirmed that this analgesic effect was only significant if the therapeutic acupuncture strategy corresponded to the G point diagnosis.</p><p id="Par50">The abdominal checkpoints shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> may be regarded as a tool to identify useful AC point strategies addressing patient discomfort. For most participants, G3 (72%) and G5 (18%) were the most sensitive checkpoints. This phenomenon might have an anatomical basis. G3 corresponds to the fundus, and G5 corresponds to the cardia. During laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), clearing the top of the fundus and angle of His (also called the esophagogastric angle) is essential. Both the fundus and the cardia are involved in this surgical step. Moreover, VSG is associated with increased intragastric pressure, which further enhances the challenge to the cardia.</p><p id="Par51">Acupuncture is often seen as a vegetative reflex therapy in which reflexes are induced via specific reflex points (acupoints) on the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], modulating the autonomous nerve system. The appropriate selection of acupoints should thus be dependent on the clinical presentation itself. The underlying physiological basis has long been debated. One hypothesis is that long-distance acupuncture effects operate partly through somato-autonomic reflexes, leading to modification of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. According to our data, the acupoints used in this syndrome are able to significantly reduce subjective and objective pain, whereas the stimulation of other sets of acupoints did not result in substantial reductions in. Certain psychological factors such as anxiety and depression seem to have an influence on both the experience of pain and the analgesic treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Few studies support the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for depression and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This might further enhance the analgesic effect in our trial.</p><p id="Par52">Our data were acquired by rigorous application of the STRICTA criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] for reporting on clinical acupuncture. However, these data were obtained in a pilot study in the context of the development of the final study design. We evaluated pain not only by subjective visual analog scales but also by objectively measurable physical parameters such as skin temperature and pressure algometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hence, we conclude that near-placebo or suggestive effects do not explain the significant pain reduction of the patients. However, the treatments were not yet randomized, and acupuncture was only single-blinded.</p><p id="Par53">Furthermore, this finding can be explained by the skin temperature changes. Skin temperature above G3 and G4 was slightly elevated only at the G point corresponding to AC of G3 syndrome, whereas treatment by other strategies would not elevate this skin temperature above these points and had no significant pain-relieving effect. We hypothesize that this increase in microcirculation after AC may support the theory that this is part of the vegetative reflex mechanisms underlying the pain-reducing effect. Further studies are needed to investigate this phenomenon.</p><p id="Par54">Considering that pain management, especially within 24&#160;h after bariatric surgery, remains a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], AC might be effective as an additional and compatible pillar in the multimodal treatment of postoperative pain.</p><p id="Par55">To the best of our knowledge, our data represent the first usable and feasible strategy of somatic acupuncture in postoperative pain of bariatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">Our data show that abdominal checkpoint acupuncture may present an effective complementary tool for postoperative pain management even within enhanced recovery pathways. Using the abdominal pressure points (G1-G6), postoperative pain can be systematically personalized and addressed after surgery. Breaking down the complexity of the functional traditional diagnosis used for acupuncture to a few abdominal pressure points may lead to rational access to effective acupuncture strategies.</p><p id="Par57">Based on our results, we developed a triple-blinded RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture after abdominal surgeries.
