To ensure sufficient time for identifying prior-year comorbid conditions using documented diagnoses, we excluded patients with less than 6 months of KPNC membership in the year before the index date. We also excluded patients without continuous membership or drug coverage during the 6 months after the index date, allowing a 30-day gap. Based on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) specifications, we excluded patients who received a drug use problem diagnosis or pharmacotherapy for OUD in the 60 days before the index date.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H2-3-AOI230022"><title>Patient Characteristics and Exposure</title><p>From the electronic health records, we extracted patients&#8217; sex, age at index, race (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, White, and unknown race and ethnicity [American Indian or Alaska Native and unknown were combined into 1 category for analysis]), ethnicity (Latino or Hispanic), type of insurance, and type of index diagnosis (DUD or unhealthy substance use behavior). Race and ethnicity were patient-reported data supplemented with provider-reported and administrative sources. For patients with index DUD diagnoses, we also identified the type of DUD (patients could have &gt;1). As a proxy measure of SES, we used the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) from geocoded census-tract data from the 2019 American Community Survey and created a categorical variable based on quartiles of each cohort&#8217;s distribution, in which the first quartile reflected a lower NDI (higher SES) and the fourth quartile reflected a higher NDI (lower SES).<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> We identified comorbid AUD and psychiatric disorder diagnoses (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) based on <italic toggle="yes">ICD-10</italic> codes documented at encounters with the health care system in the year before the index date.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> As a measure of medical comorbidity burden, we calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index score and created a categorical variable (0, 1-2, or &#8805;3).<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The primary exposure was an indicator for time (0, pre&#8211;COVID-19; 1, COVID-19 onset).</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-AOI230022"><title>Addiction Treatment Utilization Measures</title><sec id="H4-1-AOI230022"><title>Overall and Telehealth Treatment Initiation</title><p>Based on HEDIS specifications,<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> overall treatment initiation was defined as initiating addiction treatment through an inpatient admission, outpatient visit, intensive outpatient encounter or partial hospitalization, or telehealth encounter (telephone, video, or unknown modality) or receipt of medication for OUD (dispensations of buprenorphine or oral naltrexone or a claim for methadone treatment) within 14 days of the index date.

Methadone treatment was not included due to uncertainty about the days&#8217; supply from administrative claims.</p><p>Addiction treatment engagement and retention measures were examined between 2 subgroups: patients who initiated any treatment and those who initiated treatment via telehealth. Analyses of engagement and retention were restricted to those who initiated treatment by December 6, 2019, for the pre&#8211;COVID-19 cohort or December 6, 2020, for the COVID-19 onset cohort to ensure that the pre&#8211;COVID-19 cohort had the full 12-week follow-up without overlap into the COVID-19 onset period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H2-5-AOI230022"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

We next fit a series of multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation models to compare treatment utilization in the COVID-19 onset period with that in the pre&#8211;COVID-19 period while accounting for within-participant correlation of repeated observations from the same patient. Each model included a time indicator and all patient characteristics (sex, age group, race, ethnicity, type of insurance, NDI quartile, index OUD diagnosis, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, any prior-year psychiatric disorder, prior-year AUD, and the index month). We examined potential disparities in pre&#8211;COVID-19 to COVID-19 onset changes in treatment utilization by age group, race, ethnicity, and NDI quartile. We included an interaction term between the time indicator and the relevant covariate individually in separate models that included all other covariates. If the interaction term (or joint test for multiple interaction terms) was significant at 2-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.05, there was evidence that changes in utilization varied by subgroup. We then estimated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI comparing treatment utilization during COVID-19 onset with that before the COVID-19 pandemic for each patient subgroup. We were unable to examine differences in changes in OUD pharmacotherapy retention by patient subgroups due to small sample sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-3-AOI230022"><title>Results</title><sec id="H2-6-AOI230022"><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>There were 19&#8201;648 patients in the pre&#8211;COVID-19 cohort and 16&#8201;959 patients in the COVID-19 onset cohort (eFigure in <xref rid="note-AOI230022-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>); there were 2434 patients (6.6%) in both cohorts.

While increases in overall addiction treatment utilization may have been modest, it is notable that disparities in utilization by age, race, ethnicity, and SES were not exacerbated in this health care system. The findings may be generalizable to other health care systems with similarly insured populations with drug use problems and may have important policy implications given that telehealth is likely to remain a prominent modality of care delivery. This study contributes to the literature by examining several measures of addiction treatment utilization not studied previously, to our knowledge, and by evaluating differences by the key patient characteristics of age, race, ethnicity, and SES.</p><p>The increases observed across the study treatment utilization measures may have been associated with several mechanisms. First, overall increases might have been explained by increases in telehealth utilization, which may reflect broadened access to treatment due to the flexibility and convenience of telehealth care.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Although telehealth use was likely motivated by pandemic-related federal and health care system policies, patient preferences, which we could not measure in this study, may have also been involved. Prior studies showed that telehealth may be a satisfactory treatment modality for treatment-seeking patients with drug use problems<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and may be associated with improved treatment retention.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Patients may have found telehealth treatment to be more comfortable than in-person care, without barriers such as transportation and stigma (eg, fear of being negatively perceived if seen in treatment).<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Additionally, the pandemic disrupted daily routines (eg, employment loss, more time at home), so patients may have had more time and space to initiate treatment. Finally, increases in treatment utilization may also be associated with increased patient need and higher demand for addiction treatment services. Several studies suggest that substance use problems increased during the pandemic.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p><p>This study identified age differences in changes in treatment utilization from before the COVID-19 pandemic to COVID-19 onset. Younger patients were more likely to initiate overall addiction treatment during COVID-19 onset compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic, while older patients were not. These differences seem to be explained by less telehealth use by older patients, consistent with prior studies that suggest a digital divide by age,<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> but could also signify that the transition to telehealth may have helped to attract younger patients, who have shown low treatment initiation rates in prepandemic studies.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Similar age differences have been reported in studies examining telehealth treatment for other conditions in this health care system<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and other settings.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The health care system&#8217;s strategies to support telehealth use (eg, previsit calls and tech-checks) may have helped to prevent an increasing digital divide for older adults. Yet, older patients may need even greater support and a longer time to learn how to interface digitally.</p><p>We found no significant differences in the magnitude of increases in overall and telehealth treatment utilization by race, ethnicity, or SES, despite the potential for treatment disparities to widen following pandemic-related changes in care delivery. Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and Latino or Hispanic patients have had historically lower addiction treatment utilization rates compared with White patients,<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and there has been evidence of worsening treatment disparities during the pandemic in other settings.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="aoi230022r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is possible that previously discussed mechanisms associated with increases in telehealth use (eg, flexibility, lessened stigma) also have contributed to mitigating potential disparities by race and ethnicity. This study&#8217;s sample was stably insured, which made it more possible to disentangle associations of race, ethnicity, and SES from insurance status and may explain why the findings differ from those of other studies. It is important to note that the unadjusted telehealth treatment initiation rate for Black patients remained lower than for White patients in our study, reinforcing that disparities still exist even if gaps did not worsen.</p><p>There were no changes in OUD pharmacotherapy retention, consistent with a recent study of adult Medicare beneficiaries that found no changes in the proportion of eligible days covered with buprenorphine or injectable naltrexone.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Pharmacotherapy retention did not decrease, which supports permanent adoption of the pandemic-related regulations that broadened telehealth and flexibility of OUD medication prescribing.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Yet, the lack of increased retention, even in an insured system after policies broadened access to buprenorphine treatment, reinforces the continued challenge of retaining patients in OUD treatment.</p><sec id="H2-8-AOI230022"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has limitations. It was conducted among a stably insured population in an integrated health care delivery system; thus, the findings may not generalize to the overall US population without similar levels of insurance and access to care. The risk of insurance loss during the pandemic may have been heightened.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> While this study examined the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (with follow-up extending to April 2021), it is important for future studies to examine treatment beyond this time frame, as the pandemic has continued to impact health care delivery. We were unable to examine other select external addiction resources (eg, self-help and 12-step programs, Narcotics Anonymous, and Alcoholics Anonymous) but included external services for which there were claims filed within the health care system (eg, methadone treatment). However, we did not include methadone in our OUD pharmacotherapy retention measure because we were unable to determine days&#8217; supply, which may explain why we did not find increases in OUD medication retention, as a recent study observed.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> While the NDI is a multidimensional construct of neighborhood SES, we used it as a proxy of individual SES. While residual confounding by individual SES is possible, we expect it to be minimal given that KPNC covers largely urban and suburban areas, which are less prone to discordance between individual and neighborhood SES.<sup><xref rid="aoi230022r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Finally, our study did not examine outcomes of telehealth treatment utilization (eg, DUD remission), which will be important to examine in a future study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI230022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this cohort study of an insured population with drug use problems from a large, integrated health care system, addiction treatment utilization, especially telehealth, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Patients aged 18 to 34 years had a greater likelihood of telehealth treatment initiation and may have benefited from the transition to telehealth in this health care system. Importantly, disparities by race, ethnicity, and SES did not worsen during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to understand how telehealth can complement in-person care for diverse patient populations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI230022"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi230022r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><collab>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</collab></person-group>.
