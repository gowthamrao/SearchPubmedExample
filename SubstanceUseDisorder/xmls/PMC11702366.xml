<sup>1</sup>
</xref> Urinalysis (UA) is one of the most widely performed tests in the primary care setting and MH is frequently identified. In a 6&#8208;year Kaiser Permanente database study, 3,742,348 UAs were conducted of which 552,119 (20%) were diagnostic for MH.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> In a systematic review by the American Urological Association of 80,000 patients, asymptomatic MH ranged from 2.4% to 31.1%.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> In another study, 1930 patients were evaluated for hematuria with a subgroup of 982 patients identified to have MH. From this subgroup, 92 (9.4%) of patients with MH were found to have cancer.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> The low prevalence of urologic malignancy identified because of MH makes it challenging to determine an optimal diagnostic approach.</p><p>While the evaluation of gross hematuria (GH) with cystoscopy, CT Urography (CTU), and urinary cytology is generally agreed upon, the diagnostic evaluation of MH is less well&#8208;defined resulting in considerable practice variation. The previous version of the AUA MH guideline recommended the same workup for patients with MH and GH. However, because of the low risk of harboring malignancy in the setting of MH, the need for this evaluation strategy has been questioned.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The imaging modality, specifically the need for CTU, presents the most controversy. Tan et&#160;al. performed a prospective observational study of 3556 patients with macroscopic or MH. The study demonstrated ultrasound's high sensitivity and negative predictive value of 85.7% and 99.9%, respectively for the detection of renal cancer. The authors also demonstrated that ultrasound (US) had limitations for the detection of upper tract urothelial cancer with a sensitivity of 14.3%. However, the extremely low incidence (0%) of upper tract urothelial cancer in those with MH, led to the conclusion that CTU could be safely replaced by US in these patients.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> In addition, Smith et&#160;al. identified 2138 patients with asymptomatic MH and found that US properly identified 3 of 3 patients with upper tract urothelial cancer demonstrating a sensitivity of 100%.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> These studies support that US can be considered as a reasonable diagnostic imaging modality for low&#8208;risk patients who present with MH.</p><p>The goals of this study were to identify, and risk stratify a cohort of patients diagnosed with MH by their primary care provider. We then determined whether a urology visit occurred, the diagnostic strategies utilized, and whether these evaluations were concordant with the AUA/SUFU guidelines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="jgf2740-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><p>A retrospective study was performed at The University of Vermont Medical Center; a 562&#8208;bed academic medical center and affiliated primary care facilities. Eligible subjects included patients 18&#8201;years or older with a diagnosis of MH seen initially in the primary care setting between January 2020 and December 2021. Those with significant risk or strong clinical suspicion for malignancy were subsequently referred to urology at the main academic center hospital. UA was performed on the cohort for routine health monitoring at the discretion of the outpatient providers or to confirm the diagnosis of hematuria before initiating further diagnostic investigation. Patients without complete data to permit risk stratification were excluded (Figure&#160;<xref rid="jgf2740-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jgf2740-fig-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Study dataset flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-3" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="JGF2-26-73-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>Demographic information, insurance status, smoking pack years, urologic symptoms, family history, UA findings, referrals to urology, and diagnostic strategies were recorded from the electronic health record (Table&#160;<xref rid="jgf2740-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

<sup>9</sup>
</xref> If a follow&#8208;up UA was performed with negative results, this was noted as well. If a patient was referred to urology, the diagnostic tests obtained were collected. Evaluation modalities included were cystoscopies (cysto), US, CT urogram (CT uro), and any other type of CT scan (CT Other). Specific combinations of imaging were also considered (Table&#160;<xref rid="jgf2740-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The average age of the cohort was 62.5&#8201;years and 243 (66.0%) were female. All eligible patients in the study are 18&#8201;years or older who received an initial diagnosis of MH in the outpatient setting. Additional study dataset characteristics are highlighted in Table&#160;<xref rid="jgf2740-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The 267/368 (72.6%) patients had all pertinent data available for risk stratification (Figure&#160;<xref rid="jgf2740-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of these, 156 (58.4%) were considered high risk (HR), 82 (30.7%) were considered intermediate risk, and 29 (10.9%) were considered low risk.</p><p>Of the 267 patients who were included in the study were subsequently risk&#8208;stratified, 185 were female and 82 were male. Of those who were referred to urology, 60 (32.4%) were female and 38 were (46.3%) male. Of those referred, only 92 (34.5%) were ultimately seen by urology. Of those seen by urology, 55 (59.8%) high&#8208;risk, 33 intermediate&#8208;risk (36.0%), and four low&#8208;risk (4.3%), patients had a urologic visit following the MH diagnosis. The average age of the patients seen by urology was 62.1&#8201;years and that of those not seen was 62.4&#8201;years.</p><p>Of the 55 HR patients seen by urology, 41 (75%) were evaluated with imaging studies and/or cystoscopy. Of those, only 13 of the evaluations (31.7%) consisted of both CT urography and cystoscopy in&#8208;line with guideline recommendations. Twenty&#8208;eight (68.3%) of the diagnostic evaluations were guideline discordant: 10 (35.7%) with CT urogram alone, 4 (14.3%) cystoscopy alone, and 14 (50%) with other imaging studies (US and/or CT other). Of the 14 who received other imaging studies, 5 (35.7%) received only US, 4 (28.6%) received only CT other, and 5 (35.7%) received both US and CT other. Of these, 6 (3.8%) HR patient diagnoses for microhematuria were reported; 3 (50.0%) cases reported bladder cancer, 1 (16.7%) prostate cancer, 1 (16.7%) renal mass, and 1 (16.7%) nephrolithiasis.</p><p>Of the 33 intermediate&#8208;risk patients seen by urology, 27 (81.8%) were evaluated with imaging studies and/or cystoscopy.

Twenty&#8208;two (81.5%) of the diagnostic evaluations were guideline discordant: 5 (22.7%) received a cystoscopy with a CT imaging study, 2 (9.1%) received a renal US with a CT imaging study, 5 (22.7%) received only a renal US, and the remaining 10 (45.5%) patients received some combination of CT imaging and/or cystoscopy. Seven (8.5%) intermediate&#8208;risk patients' diagnosis for microhematuria were reported.

No cystoscopies were performed in this group of patients. One patient received a renal US in conjunction with a CT other. One patient received only CT other and one patient received only a CT urogram. Therefore, no low&#8208;risk patients seen by urology received a diagnostic evaluation that was guideline&#8208;concordant. 8 (27.6%) low&#8208;risk patients' diagnosis for microhematuria were reported. Four patients were further evaluated by a urologist of which 1 (12.5%) bladder cancer, 1 (12.5%) renal cyst, and 2 (25%) nephrolithiasis cases were reported.

This is consistent with findings in the literature that demonstrate low urology referral rates for MH. Nieder et&#160;al. found that 36% of the patients presenting to their PCPs with MH were referred to urology.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Another study by Yafi et&#160;al. found that only 48.6% of patients with two consecutive events of significant MH were recommended referral to urology.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> The findings of these studies highlight the lack of PCP guidance regarding referrals for this patient population.</p><p>The dilemma surrounding the diagnostic evaluation of MH involves the need to balance the potential negative sequela of CTU (radiation exposure, cost, and management of incidental findings) with the small but important concern of missing urologic malignancy.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> To address this concern, the updated AUA/SUFU guideline incorporates risk stratification for patients with MH. Specifically, patients with more risk factors for the presence of urologic malignancy based on age, RBC count on microscopy, smoking pack years, and history of GH warrant cystoscopy and CTU, while those at lower risk will be more appropriately evaluated with alternative imaging strategies such as renal ultrasound.</p><p>After risk stratification of our cohort, a large percentage of patients were classified as high&#8208;risk and therefore warranted urologic consultation and workup with cystoscopy and CTU according to AUA guidelines. It is important to note that approximately 65% of the HR patients in our cohort did not see a urologist and even fewer had the recommended diagnostic evaluation. As the updated AUA guidelines have only been recently published, this is the first study to our knowledge that describes a population of patients with MH after risk stratification per guidelines. Across all strata, only 6.7% (18/267) of patients were given AUA guideline&#8208;concordant care. Although the optimal treatment plans vary for each patient depending on unique independent factors, there is an alarming rate of incongruence from suggested AUA guidelines. One independent factor such as gender may have influenced the decision&#8208;making process which may explain the difference in the referral rates by gender. Based on our cohort, the referral rate was 32.4% for women and 46.3% for men. One study demonstrated that women were referred to urologists less often and after a longer time since an initial presentation of hematuria when compared to men.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> It is certainly plausible that women are being erroneously treated for other diagnoses including urinary tract infections or postmenopausal bleeding, before being further evaluated by urology.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Currently, there is ongoing debate regarding the ideal diagnostic evaluation for MH because of the very low rates of malignancy detection in this population of patients. In our cohort of intermediate and high&#8208;risk patients, a 2.5% incidence of bladder cancer was found. Another study found a 2.7%, 0.4%, and 0% incidence of bladder, renal, and upper tract urothelial cancer, respectively.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> The previous AUA guidelines for the evaluation of MH recommended cystoscopy and CT urography for all patients with MH (3 or greater RBC/HPF).<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The goal of this approach was to minimize the chances of missing a urologic malignancy related to the MH diagnosis. The updated guidelines consider the overall low detection rate of malignancy and reserve CTU for those with the highest risk while low and intermediate&#8208;risk patients would not receive CTU. The benefit of such an approach is to reduce costs, radiation exposure, and over&#8208;identification of incidental findings that may require additional evaluation.<xref rid="jgf2740-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Future quality initiatives in the form of educational sessions and risk stratification algorithms in electronic health records may be beneficial for PCPs to optimize the management of this patient population. Additionally, there is a need to reinforce guideline recommendations to current practicing urologists and PCPs to ensure consistency. With the increasingly aging general population and stagnation in the growth of urologists, PCPs, and urologists must be aware of MH guidelines to ensure that all patients with urologic concerns can be appropriately seen.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. First is the retrospective design and its inherent drawbacks. Second, there were patient exclusions because of missing data preventing patient risk stratification. Third, many patients were missing a diagnostic cause of their microhematuria preventing a complete analysis of incidence. This can be attributed to numerous factors including poor follow&#8208;up because of COVID protocols, lack of proper guideline adherence, and poor documentation. Patients who had hematuria and concurrent urinary tract infection symptoms were sometimes treated empirically without a formal visit which resulted in no formal documentation of a final diagnosis. Fourth, was the limited racial diversity in the population, primarily because of the institution's geographic location. Approximately 94.4% of participants identify as white, constraining our capacity to stratify the results by racial categories. Additionally, we were not able to identify the factors that led to a patient not receiving a urology visit. This could be because of numerous reasons in addition to the PCP not requesting a consult including the willingness of follow&#8208;up care by patients, financial and other patient resource limitations, and strict COVID&#8208;19 precautions. Sixth was the difficulty identifying which patients were recommended referral by PCPs versus those who were already being longitudinally followed by urology for another co&#8208;morbidity. Therefore, a patient's imaging or cystoscopy may have been ordered as a result of another cause not related to MH. Additionally, guideline discordance in general likely resulted from various sources: incorrect imaging ordered from PCPs, varying practice preferences by urologists, and patient compliance. Therefore, causation cannot be determined by our study. Seventh, we do not have the clinical outcomes of the patients who were diagnostically evaluated or those who received follow&#8208;up care at another health network system. However, this is not likely as our hospital is the only tertiary healthcare center for the entire state, and patients seeking care outside this health network would be very unlikely. Finally, because this was a study from one small population within the United States, it is not clear whether the breakdown of risk&#8208;stratified patients mirrors the breakdown at the national level. Therefore, future work should look at risk&#8208;stratification breakdown at a much larger level to assess this study's external validity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="jgf2740-sec-0010"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A significant number of patients who present through the primary care setting with a diagnosis of MH are not receiving evaluations in accordance with the AUA/SUFU 2020 guidelines, especially a large number of high&#8208;risk patients (156/267). Of the high&#8208;risk patients who were diagnostically evaluated, about 1/3 ultimately received guideline&#8208;concordant care. These current practice patterns risk missing the identification of urologic malignancy and can also lead to the inappropriate use of resources for those without a true diagnosis of MH. In summary, the results of this manuscript demonstrate an inherent discrepancy between guidelines and actual practice patterns for the workup and management of MH. A more coordinated care pathway between primary care services and urologists combined with education efforts is needed to raise guideline awareness and optimize the care of this patient population. We hope that these measures will ultimately help reduce the discrepancy between guidelines and actual practice partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="jgf2740-sec-0012"><title>CONFLICT OF
