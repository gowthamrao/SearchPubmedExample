40397996,Trends in substance use among child welfare-involved parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Parental substance use is a major risk factor for child maltreatment, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use among parents involved in child welfare is not well understood. This study aimed to examine substance use patterns in child welfare cases from 2019 to 2022. Female parents assessed for child abuse or neglect using administrative data from the Ohio Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Ohio SACWIS). Substance types were recorded during the family assessment at case entry. A retrospective observational study was conducted to compare substance involvement before, during, and after the onset of the pandemic. Single changepoint analyses identified significant shifts in the mean percentage of cases involving substance use overall and for specific substances during selected weeks of each year. Among 264,380 women investigated, 65,796 (24.9 %) were involved with substance use. In 2020, the percentage of cases involving substance use peaked in the second quarter, driven by polysubstance and cannabis use. Changepoint analyses confirmed these changes. Only in 2020 did substance use cases significantly increase (32.4 % to 41.8 %) in week 10, coinciding with the national emergency declaration. Similar increases were observed for polysubstance and cannabis use. The rise in substance-involved cases early in the pandemic corroborates national trends, with cannabis use notably driving this change, suggesting that parents may have used substances to cope. The high prevalence of polysubstance use highlights the need for targeted treatment programs and policy interventions for parental substance use.",Child abuse & neglect,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.chiabu.2025.107487,Yun Ye,Bridget Freisthler,"The Ohio State University, College of Social Work, 1947 College Road N., Columbus, OH 43210, United States of America.

40398613,Analysis of therapeutic adherence to antidepressants and associated factors in patients with depressive disorder: A population-based cohort study.,"Non-adherence to antidepressants is a common problem that can significantly impact health outcomes in patients with depressive disorders. The aim of this study was to assess antidepressant adherence rates and identify factors associated with non-adherence in a population-based cohort of patients with depressive disorders, using real-world data. This retrospective, population-based cohort study used real-world data from patients diagnosed with depression in the Canary Islands, Spain, between 2013 and 2021. Adherence to antidepressants was assessed using the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) over a 12-month follow-up period. Patients were classified as adherent if they had an MPR ≥ 0.8. To assess the association with sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, multivariate logistic regression models were performed. Among the 39,800 patients included, the overall adherence rate to antidepressants was 31.02 %. Older age, female sex, and the presence of multiple comorbidities were significantly associated with higher adherence rates. In contrast, alcohol, and tobacco use, as well as inadequate nutrition, were significantly linked with lower adherence. Non-adherence to antidepressants is a highly prevalent problem in patients with depressive disorders. The findings of this study highlight the importance of identifying factors that influence adherence and developing specific interventions to improve treatment outcomes in this population.",Journal of affective disorders,2025-09-15,10.1016/j.jad.2025.119443,Diego Infante-Ventura,Tasmania Del Pino-Sedeño,"Canary Islands Health Research Institute Foundation (FIISC), Tenerife, Spain; Evaluation Unit (SESCS), Canary Islands Health Service (SCS), Tenerife, Spain; Spanish Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment for the National Health Service (RedETS), Spain; Department of Clinical Psychology, Psychobiology and Methodology, University of La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain.; Canary Islands Health Research Institute Foundation (FIISC), Tenerife, Spain; Evaluation Unit (SESCS), Canary Islands Health Service (SCS), Tenerife, Spain; Spanish Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment for the National Health Service (RedETS), Spain.; Canary Islands Health Research Institute Foundation (FIISC), Tenerife, Spain; Evaluation Unit (SESCS), Canary Islands Health Service (SCS), Tenerife, Spain; Spanish Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment for the National Health Service (RedETS), Spain; Research Network on Chronicity, Primary Care, and Health Promotion (RICAPPS), Carlos III Health Institute (Instituto de Salud Carlos III), Madrid, Spain.; Canary Islands Health Research Institute Foundation (FIISC), Tenerife, Spain; Evaluation Unit (SESCS), Canary Islands Health Service (SCS), Tenerife, Spain; Spanish Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment for the National Health Service (RedETS), Spain; Research Network on Chronicity, Primary Care, and Health Promotion (RICAPPS), Carlos III Health Institute (Instituto de Salud Carlos III), Madrid, Spain.; Research Network on Chronicity, Primary Care, and Health Promotion (RICAPPS), Carlos III Health Institute (Instituto de Salud Carlos III), Madrid, Spain; Data Science for Health Services and Policy Research Group, Aragon Health Sciences Institute (IACS), Zaragoza, Spain.; Department of Mental Health.

40401763,Anxiety but not Depression Is Associated With Increased Health Care Utilization Following Lumbar Fusion.,"Observational cohort study. The purpose of this study is to describe the association between 3 prevalent mental health comorbidities and 1-year health care utilization after lumbar fusion surgery. The volume of lumbar fusion procedures in the United States is increasing, leading to a substantial postoperative health care burden. Postoperative costs associated with these procedures may be driven by a number of factors, including patient comorbidities. A large national commercial claims database (MarketScan, Merative) was analyzed. Patients who underwent a single-level lumbar fusion from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, were included in the study. Patients were categorized based on the presence of a prior diagnosis of opioid dependence, anxiety, or depression. The main outcome was the total cost for postoperative interventions in the 1-year period after lumbar fusion. Interventions examined in this study included: (i) physical therapy, (ii) injections, (iii) pain medication, (iv) imaging, (v) clinic visits, and (vi) subsequent spine surgeries. The study population included 4245 patients (anxiety, 19.2%; depression; 19.2%; opioid dependence, 2.6%). The average total 1-year postoperative cost per patient was $8641 ± 19,661. Higher-cost patients were more likely to be those with a prior diagnosis of anxiety (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.69, P<0.001) or opioid dependence (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.23-2.69, P<0.01). Anxiety was found to be associated with the largest relative increases in total costs compared with patients without this diagnosis (+$2,272, P=0.003). The cost of pain medication was 4.2 times higher (P<0.001) among patients with a prior diagnosis of opioid dependence. Patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion have varying levels of health care utilization, with a prior diagnosis of anxiety likely to drive higher costs.",Clinical spine surgery,2025-05-22,10.1097/BSD.0000000000001783,Darren Z Nin,David H Kim,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Tufts University School of Medicine.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Neurosurgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Tufts University School of Medicine.",N/A,"comorbidities, costs, health care utilization, mental health"
40402494,"Participant Needs, Service Utilization, and Costs in a Medicaid Housing Pilot Program.","Housing instability and homelessness have wide-ranging health and social effects. Health systems increasingly recognize the importance of addressing these needs to make progress toward health equity goals and reduce health care costs. State Medicaid programs are uniquely positioned to support the housing needs of their members but are relatively new to the housing space and need to understand how to most effectively partner with the housing sector to improve health outcomes. To evaluate the implementation and initial outcomes of a housing benefit pilot program, including participant characteristics, needs, and service utilization. This was a cohort study involving a pilot program that provided temporary rental assistance, housing navigation, and additional supports to Medicaid members between May 2022 and October 2024. The pilot took place in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area involving Medicaid members of Health Share of Oregon, a large coordinated care organization. Individuals were referred to the program primarily from foster care, substance use disorder residential programs, and corrections facilities. Data were analyzed from October 2024 to March 2025. Enrolled participants received services, including temporary rental assistance, housing navigation, and other supports, for up to 12 months, with modifications made mid-pilot due to capacity challenges. Participant demographic characteristics, baseline needs, service utilization, and costs associated with the housing benefit program. Of 716 referrals, 517 individuals (mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.1] years; 295 [57.1%] male) enrolled; including 14 American Indian or Alaskan Native individuals (2.7%), 7 Asian individuals (1.4%), 67 Black individuals (13.0%), 22 Hispanic individuals (4.3%), 6 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander individuals (1.2%), and 308 White individuals (59.6%); 513 individuals (99.2%) spoke English. Participants had substantial housing needs, with rent (383 individuals [74.1%]) and utility (282 individuals [54.5%]) support being the most frequently reported needs and used services. The mean (SD) cost per member per month was $2225 ($1586). Frequently reported nonhousing needs included employment (154 individuals [42.3%]), food (152 individuals [41.8%]), mental health (94 individuals [25.8%]), and transportation (86 individuals [23.6%]). The findings of this cohort study provide critical insights into the types of services needed and associated costs for supporting housing as a Medicaid benefit. Significant needs were observed, emphasizing the necessity of cross-sector collaboration and clear role definitions between health care and housing organizations. The findings offer valuable lessons for the design and implementation of housing support programs under Medicaid; these insights are crucial as Oregon and other states consider similar initiatives to address housing as a health-related social need.",JAMA network open,2025-05-01,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.12405,Monique Gill,Catherine J Livingston,"Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Health Share of Oregon, Portland.; Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Health Share of Oregon, Portland.; Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.","Humans, United States, Medicaid, Male, Female, Pilot Projects, Adult, Middle Aged, Housing, Ill-Housed Persons, Oregon, Cohort Studies",N/A
40406079,Socioeconomic differences in discharge against medical advice and hospital admission among emergency department visits associated with substance use in the United States.,"Discharge against medical advice (DAMA) and inpatient admission (IA) among emergency department (ED) visits are two important outcomes in hospital utilization, while the first one has been mainly considered a negative outcome. This study aimed to examine the association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA among ED visits with substance use (age 12-64 years) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study retrospectively analyzed the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2019 to 2020. The International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify opioid, cannabis, and alcohol use, and smoking. The pandemic was significantly associated with higher odds of IA (OR 1.04, CI 1.02-1.06). Female gender and rural hospitals were adversely associated with both DAMA and IA, but lower household incomes were positively and negatively associated with DAMA and IA, respectively. Race and health insurance were partly differently associated with these outcomes. Asian patients exhibited significantly lower odds (OR 0.82, CI 0.71-0.88) regarding DAMA. Black (OR 0.79, CI 0.78-0.80) and Native American patients (OR 0.87, CI 0.82-0.90) exhibited lower odds, and Hispanic (OR 1.05, CI 1.03-1.06) and Asian patients (OR 1.40, CI 1.33-1.44) had higher odds compared to White patients in terms of AI. Except for self-pay, which was associated with lower odds of IA, Medicaid, self-pay, and free care were significantly associated with higher odds of DAMA and IA. Our results also showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the association of health insurance with IA, but not with DAMA. These findings highlight the complex association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA. By addressing these differences within the hospital setting, providers can mitigate the negative consequences of substance use on patient health and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.",Frontiers in public health,2025,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1431384,Zahra Mojtahedi,Jay J Shen,"Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Research Core Capacity, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, United States.; Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Department of Healthcare Administration, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Center for Health Disparities Research, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.","Humans, Emergency Service, Hospital, Adult, United States, Female, Male, Middle Aged, Adolescent, Substance-Related Disorders, Retrospective Studies, Socioeconomic Factors, Patient Discharge, COVID-19, Young Adult, Child, Hospitalization, Emergency Room Visits","discharge against medical advice, disparity, emergency department, inpatient admission, public health"
40406152,Serum sodium within the normal range and its U-shaped relationship with biological aging in U.S. adults.,"This cross-sectional study evaluated the correlation between serum sodium levels (135-145 mmol/L) and biological aging in U.S. adults. Biological age, derived from multi-system biomarkers, provides a more accurate assessment of aging than chronological age. Hydration balance, reflected by serum sodium, may modulate age-related diseases and mortality, but its link to biological aging remains underexplored. Using NHANES data (1999-2018), we focused on normonatremic adults (≥20 years). The final cohort included 18,301 participants. Biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method, and ∆age (biological age-chronological age) was calculated. Associations were assessed using multivariate regression, generalized additive models, and threshold analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for variations across different populations. Nonlinear analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between serum sodium and biological age. The lowest biological age occurred at 139.3 mmol/L: each 1 mmol/L increase below this threshold was associated with a reduction of 0.10 years in biological age (95% CI: -0.15, -0.05), whereas values above it showed a 0.08-year increase (95% CI: 0.04, 0.13). For ∆age, a negative association was observed below 141.2 mmol/L, with each increase linked to a 0.07-year decrease (95% CI: -0.10, -0.04). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions in diabetic and smoking populations. Maintaining serum sodium levels within an optimal range (138-142 mmol/L) may help delay biological aging. Hydration management may serve as a modifiable factor for healthy aging, particularly in high-risk groups such as individuals with diabetes or tobacco use.",Frontiers in nutrition,2025,10.3389/fnut.2025.1589962,Xianxiang Tong,Mengxue Liu,"Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",N/A,"aging, biological age, hydration, hydration management, serum sodium"
40406410,Association between geriatric nutritional risk index and osteoarthritis in aged person over 60: data from NHANES 2005-2018.,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent age-related degenerative joint disorder, demonstrates significant associations with nutritional status. This study examines the prognostic value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in OA risk stratification among elderly individuals. This retrospective analysis utilized seven NHANES cycles (2005-2018) encompassing geriatric participants (≥ 60 years) possessing complete GNRI measurements and baseline covariates. For comparative cohort balancing, propensity score matching was executed using inverse probability weighting a matched-pairs design, adjusting for age, alcohol consumption, and the Poverty Income Ratio. Multivariable-adjusted weighted logistic regression quantified GNRI-OA associations, with restricted cubic splines (RCS) characterizing nonlinear dynamics. Subgroup analyses were also performed. This cross-sectional analysis identified 656 OA cases among 3,120 rigorously screened geriatric participants. Elevated GNRI levels demonstrated a significant association with increased OA risk among geriatric populations, with the correlation remaining robust in sensitivity analyses adjusted for metabolic confounders. Specifically, a GNRI ≥ 123.63 was associated with a higher probability of OA in this population. RCS analysis revealed a significant non-linear relationship (p_non-linear < 0.001) between GNRI and OA risk, particularly among men and non-smokers. Subgroup analyses indicated that males, Hispanic Americans, Non-Hispanic Black people, non-smokers, and those with a low PIR were more sensitive to changes in GNRI. Elevated GNRI was independently associated with OA prevalence in geriatric populations, demonstrating nutritional status's pivotal role in degenerative joint pathophysiology. The impact of GNRI on OA risk may differ across demographic subgroups, highlighting the need for personalized approaches in managing OA risk based on nutritional status.",Frontiers in medicine,2025,10.3389/fmed.2025.1579095,Hongxu Lu,Baoleri Xilin,"Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.",N/A,"NHANES, elderly, geriatric nutritional risk index, osteoarthritis, risk factors"
40409187,Investigating the associations of blood lead and cadmium with smoking-related DNA methylation and mortality among U.S. adults.,"Lead and cadmium have been linked to alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) and increased mortality. However, the role of smoking-related DNAm in the link between these heavy metals and mortality remains unclear. We analyzed data from 2110 participants aged 50 and older from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), linked to mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with follow-up through 2019. Our study examined the associations between blood lead and cadmium levels, DNA methylation-predicted pack years of smoking (DNAmPackYrs), and mortality outcomes. Our analysis found that higher natural logarithm (Ln)-transformed lead and cadmium levels were positively associated with ln-DNAmPackYrs, with a percent change of 11.34 % (P = 0.001) for lead and 35.57 % (P < 0.001) for cadmium. Participants with both heavy metals above the 50th percentile had the highest DNAmPackYrs, with P for trend < 0.001. Weighted Cox regression analysis demonstrated both ln-lead and ln-DNAmPackYrs were linked to an elevated risk of all mortality outcomes, while ln-cadmium specifically predicted all-cause mortality. A significant interaction between lead and cadmium in relation to all-cause mortality was observed (P for interaction = 0.036). Additionally, significant interactions between DNAmPackYrs and both heavy metals were found in relation to all-cause mortality (P for interaction = 0.001 for lead; P for interaction = 0.013 for cadmium). Drawing from a nationally representative cohort of older U.S. adults, this study provides robust evidence linking blood lead and cadmium levels to smoking-related DNAm and increased mortality risk. Moreover, the analysis revealed additive effects of these metals on smoking-related DNAm, as well as synergistic impacts on all-cause mortality. Additionally, smoking-induced DNAm may play a role in mediating the connection between heavy metal exposure and mortality risk. Additional research is required to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these associations.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025-07-01,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118360,Yu-Wei Fang,Chien-Yu Lin,"Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shin-Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei 111, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei 242, Taiwan.; Department of Cardiology, National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, Yunlin 640, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, Taichung 435, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shin-Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei 111, Taiwan; Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, En Chu Kong Hospital, Taipei 237, Taiwan.

There are few evaluations using real-world data to compare overdose risk after receipt of different addiction treatment modalities. To assess the association between receipt of different addiction treatment modalities and risk of subsequent opioid overdose among opioid overdose survivors. Survival analysis comparing time-to-subsequent overdose within a cohort of opioid overdose survivors using a linked state-wide individual level data of different addiction treatment modalities: opioid agonists treatments (OAT, i.e., methadone or buprenorphine) and non-medication based inpatient addiction treatments (medically supervised opioid withdrawal and extended inpatient treatment). Opioid-involved overdose survivors (N = 4089) admitted to a hospital or emergency department in Connecticut between May 2016 and December 2017 MAIN MEASURES: Time-to-subsequent overdose (fatal or non-fatal) and time-to-subsequent fatal overdose KEY RESULTS: Following the index overdose, 467 (11.4 %) experienced another overdose event within 12 months (87 fatal and 380 non-fatal), 35 % received OAT (25 % buprenorphine and 13 % methadone), and 21 % received inpatient addiction treatment (19 % medically supervised opioid withdrawal and 8 % extended inpatient treatment). In survival analyses adjusted for demographics, incarceration, and receipt of non-OAT opioids or benzodiazepines, receipt of methadone (aHR 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.66) or buprenorphine (aHR 0.72, 95 % CI: 0.53-0.98) was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent overdose compared to no receipt of methadone or buprenorphine, respectively. Neither medically supervised opioid withdrawal (aHR 1.08, 95 % CI: 0.77-1.50) nor extended inpatient treatment (aHR 0.90, 95 % CI: 0.53-1.54) was associated with reduced risk of subsequent overdose. Neither OAT nor non-medication based inpatient treatment modalities were associated with a change in risk of subsequent fatal overdose; benzodiazepine exposure was associated with increased risk (aHR 2.65, 95 % CI: 1.66-4.23). Using statewide data, our findings underscore the importance of OAT to reduce risk of subsequent overdose following a non-fatal opioid overdose.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112679,Benjamin A Howell,William C Becker,"Section of General Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States; Program in Addiction Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.

Although risk factors are well known, most tools for identifying individuals at highest risk of these behaviours have limited clinical value. We aimed to develop and internally validate models to predict intentional self-harm and suicide risk among people who have been in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Retrospective observational cohort study using linked administrative data. New South Wales, Australia. 46 330 people prescribed OAT between January 2005 and November 2017. Intentional self-harm and suicide prediction within a 30-day window using linked population datasets for OAT, hospitalisation, mental health care, incarceration and mortality. Machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and gradient boosting, assessed over 80 factors during the last 3, 6 and 12 months. Feature visualisation using SHapley Additive exPlanations. Gradient boosting identified 30 important factors in predicting self-harm and/or suicide. These included the most recent frequency of emergency department presentations; hospital admissions involving mental disorders such as borderline personality, substance dependence, psychosis and depression/anxiety; and recent release from incarceration. The best fitting model had a Gini coefficient of 0.65 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82] and was applied to 2017 data to estimate the probability of self-harm and/or suicide. On average 46 people (0.16%) (from a total of 28 000 people in OAT) experienced intentional self-harm or suicide per month. Applying a 0.15% probability threshold, approximately 5167 people were classified as high risk, identifying 69% of all self-harm or suicide cases per month. This figure reduced to 450 per month after excluding people already identified in the previous month. Among people in opioid agonist treatment, administrative linked data can be used with advanced machine learning algorithms to predict self-harm and/or suicide in a 30-day prediction window.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2025-05-25,10.1111/add.70095,Nicola R Jones,Louisa Degenhardt,"National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; SydneyMSK Research Flagship Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Monash Addiction Research Centre, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Department of Family Medicine and Emergency Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.",N/A,"data linkage, machine learning, opioid‐related disorders, self‐harm, suicide & feature analysis"
40418717,Impact of Preexisting Substance Use Disorders on Prolonged Opioid Use and Postoperative Complications After Burns.,"Previous studies have linked preexisting substance use disorders to adverse postoperative outcomes in burn patients, yet their impact on opioid use remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study compares the effects of various substances on opioid use after burns and aims to analyze the risks and whether they differ among substances. The TriNetX database was queried for burn patients aged 18 years and older with preexisting alcohol, cannabis, or tobacco use disorders, who were placed in their respective cohorts. These patients were matched to a non-substance use disorder cohort using propensity score matching based on demographics, mental health, pain syndromes, and burn severity. The measured outcomes assessed were opioid use, wound infection, wound disruption, and postprocedural pain. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 3 months and 12 months post-burn. After matching, patients with preexisting substance use disorders had significantly higher risk ratios for prolonged opioid use, wound infections, and wound healing disruptions at both 3- and 12-months compared to matched patient control cohorts. Additionally, all patient cohorts also exhibited increased risk of postprocedural pain. Burn patients with preexisting substance use disorders face a significantly higher risk of prolonged opioid use and postoperative complications at both 3- and 12-month post-burn injury. The alcohol cohort patients were associated with the greatest increase in opioid use and postoperative complications, while the tobacco patient cohort presented with the highest wound disruption rates at 3- and 12-months post-burn.",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2025-05-26,10.1093/jbcr/iraf098,Philong Nguyen,Juquan Song,"John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Indiana University School of Medicine, 340 W 10th St, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, Texas 75390, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.",N/A,"Burn Injuries, Opioid Dependence, Postoperative Complications, Substance Use Disorder"
40420426,Return to alcohol use among patients who are in recovery from alcohol use disorder with pharmacologically treated vs untreated insomnia.,"Patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) often experience sleep disturbances in early and sustained recovery, and patients with AUD and sleep disturbances are at an increased risk of returning to alcohol use. This study was a retrospective claims analysis with a nested case-control design utilizing data from the Merative™ MarketScan®, Commercial, and Medicare Supplemental databases. Adults aged 18 to 80 years with ≥1 AUD remission diagnosis and a subsequent insomnia diagnosis were included. In patients with AUD who were in remission and had a subsequent insomnia diagnosis, the odds of return to alcohol use were compared between those who received pharmacotherapeutic intervention for insomnia and those who did not receive such treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. Among the 6,002 patients who met the inclusion criteria within the Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases, the adjusted OR comparing odds of return to alcohol use in patients who received treatment for insomnia compared to those who did not was 0.81 (95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.69, 0.96;  These data suggest that patients with AUD who are in remission and have insomnia experience a lower odds of return to alcohol use following pharmacotherapy for insomnia compared with patients who did not receive pharmacotherapy, underscoring the importance of identifying insomnia and carefully considering the risk-benefit of treatment interventions, including pharmacologic approaches where appropriate, to decrease the risk of return to alcohol use.",Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,2025-05-27,10.15288/jsad.24-00354,Jaromir Mikl,Valentine Pascale,"Purdue Pharma L.P., 201 Tresser Blvd., Stamford, CT, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.; Purdue Pharma L.P., 201 Tresser Blvd., Stamford, CT, USA.",N/A,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD), cessation, insomnia, outcome measures, return to alcohol use, sleep disorder"
40435106,The UK Biobank mental health enhancement 2022: Methods and results.,"This paper introduces the UK Biobank (UKB) second mental health questionnaire (MHQ2), describes its design, the respondents and some notable findings. UKB is a large cohort study with over 500,000 volunteer participants aged 40-69 years when recruited in 2006-2010. It is an important resource of extensive health, genetic and biomarker data. Enhancements to UKB enrich the data available. MHQ2 is an enhancement designed to enable and facilitate research with psychosocial and mental health aspects. UKB sent participants a link to MHQ2 by email in October-November 2022. The MHQ2 was designed by a multi-institutional consortium to build on MHQ1. It characterises lifetime depression further, adds data on panic disorder and eating disorders, repeats 'current' mental health measures and updates information about social circumstances. It includes established measures, such as the PHQ-9 for current depression and CIDI-SF for lifetime panic, as well as bespoke questions. Algorithms and R code were developed to facilitate analysis. At the time of analysis, MHQ2 results were available for 169,253 UKB participants, of whom 111,275 had also completed the earlier MHQ1. Characteristics of respondents and the whole UKB cohort are compared. The major phenotypes are lifetime: depression (18%); panic disorder (4.0%); a specific eating disorder (2.8%); and bipolar affective disorder I (0.4%). All mental disorders are found less with older age and also seem to be related to selected social factors. In those participants who answered both MHQ1 (2016) and MHQ2 (2022), current mental health measure showed that fewer respondents have harmful alcohol use than in 2016 (relative risk 0.84), but current depression (RR 1.07) and anxiety (RR 0.98) have not fallen, as might have been expected given the relationship with age. We also compare lifetime concepts for test-retest reliability. There are some drawbacks to UKB due to its lack of population representativeness, but where the research question does not depend on this, it offers exceptional resources that any researcher can apply to access. This paper has just scratched the surface of the results from MHQ2 and how this can be combined with other tranches of UKB data, but we predict it will enable many future discoveries about mental health and health in general.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0324189,Katrina A S Davis,Matthew Hotopf,"King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Helmholtz Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.; Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Copenhagen University Hospital - Mental Health Services CPH, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Mental Health Center Sct.

40439116,Menopausal hormone therapy and the female brain: Leveraging neuroimaging and prescription registry data from the UK Biobank cohort.,"Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is generally thought to be neuroprotective, yet results have been inconsistent. Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK Biobank. 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Detailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. We tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter brain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT user status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of administration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the effects of a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users and examined associations by APOE ε4 status. Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter brain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes compared to never-users. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post-menopause was associated with older gray and white matter brain age, larger white matter hyperintensity volume, and smaller hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed  Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history.

40440488,Risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with hepatitis C virus in pregnancy.,"To evaluate maternal sociodemographic factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during pregnancy in a large population of live births. Retrospective analysis of the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Natality Live Birth database (2016-2021). All births were eligible for inclusion. Deliveries with missing data on HCV infection were excluded. Multiple sociodemographic factors and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were compared between pregnancies complicated by maternal HCV infection and those without HCV. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with HCV and adjust outcomes for potential confounders. Of the 22,604,938 live births included, 107,761 (0.48 %) were complicated by maternal HCV. Patients with HCV in pregnancy were more likely to be advanced maternal age, have Medicaid insurance, or smokers. In addition, HCV in pregnancy was associated with higher risks of concurrent infections with hepatitis B virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia. HCV was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth <37 weeks, low birthweight, congenital anomalies at birth, low 5-min Apgar scores, NICU admission, antibiotic treatment for suspected neonatal sepsis, as well as immediate and prolonged ventilation. Based on this recent, large US population cohort, HCV in pregnancy is more commonly associated with certain sociodemographic factors and several adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. These data are an important step in the attempt to identify at-risk patients and employ strategies to better manage and optimize care for these pregnancies.",Journal of perinatal medicine,2025-05-28,10.1515/jpm-2025-0146,Moti Gulersen,Eran Bornstein,"Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 6529 Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Biostatistics and Data Management, New York University Rory Meyers College of Nursing, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.",N/A,"HCV, infectious disease, maternal morbidity, neonatal morbidity, preterm birth, sexually transmitted infection"
40441405,Non-Tobacco Nicotine Dependence is Associated with Increased Postoperative Pain and Opioid Requirement Following Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair.,"The increasing prevalence of non-tobacco nicotine dependence (NTND) related to vaping has raised concerns about its potential impact on rotator cuff disease especially given the pain after repair. This study aims to compare the risk of various surgical outcomes in patients with NTND, as compared to a control group without NTND. A retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database examined patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated arthroscopically from 2004 to 2021. A NTND patient cohort was compared to a non-NTND cohort. Patients were 1:1 propensity matched, controlling for demographics and comorbidities. 90-day outcomes measured included postoperative infection, pain, shoulder stiffness, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, mononeuropathy, physical therapy, hospital admissions, and emergency visits. 3-year outcomes measured included opioid abuse, shoulder pain, revision surgery, arthrocentesis/injection, and shoulder arthroplasty. Relative risks (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were calculated to assess the association between NTND and these surgical outcomes. 1,572 patients were included in each group. At 90 days postoperative, the NTND cohort had a significantly higher risk of opioid use with an RR of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.46, p < 0.001), and emergency department visits with an RR of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.02, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference observed between groups in acute postoperative pain (RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.07, p = 0.041), postoperative shoulder stiffness (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.42, p = 0.628) and orthopedic aftercare (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.17, p = 0.925). At 3 years postoperative, the NTND cohort had a significantly higher risk of opioid use (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.21, p < 0.001). Following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, NTND use among patients was associated with a higher risk of emergency department visits in the initial 90 days postoperatively. NTND use was associated with a higher postoperative opioid requirement in the initial 90 days following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and this increased narcotic usage was sustained at 3 years postoperatively. Patients should be counseled preoperatively about the elevated risks associated with non-tobacco nicotine products.",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,2025-05-27,10.1016/j.jse.2025.04.011,Jad J Lawand,Joseph A Abboud,"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation.

This retrospective cohort study used US national Medicaid data for youth 9 to 24 years of age who were prescribed antidepressants for a new episode of major depression from January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2019 (N = 196,364). Quality measures were derived from 3 Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures: (1) acute phase, the percentage of youth who remained on antidepressants for 3 months; (2) continuation phase, the percentage of youth who remained on antidepressants for 6 months; and (3) follow-up contacts, the percentage of youth who received at least 3 follow-up visits during the acute phase. Robust Poisson regression examined associations between demographic, clinical, and county-level factors and adherence. Approximately half (49.6%) of the youth were adherent to acute-phase medication management and 55.2% had at least 3 follow-up visits; only 26.5% met continuation phase metrics. Older age, minoritized racial/ethnic status, and substance use disorders were associated with lower adherence. In contrast, youth with chronic medical conditions, prior use of other psychotropic medications, or in foster care had higher adherence. A substantial proportion of youth with depression receiving antidepressant treatment do not receive care aligned with quality measures, with notable disparities among older youth and racial/ethnic minorities. Targeted quality improvement efforts are needed to close gaps in adherence and follow-up care, particularly for underserved populations, and to promote more consistent, equitable treatment delivery.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2025-05-27,10.1016/j.jaac.2025.05.011,Cynthia A Fontanella,Mark Olfson,"Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio; The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

Work context varies across race, ethnicity and sex. The objective is to examine the association of self-employment status and CVD risk factors across racial and ethnic minority status as well as sex. For this observational study, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (1999-2018), a cross-sectional study design, and stratified logistic regression models were used to explore the association between self-employment status (a dichotomous variable) and CVD risk factors (dichotomized measures of elevated cholesterol, hypertension, glucose intolerance, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, binge drinking, sub-optimal sleep duration and poor mental health) across combined racial and ethnic minority status and sex groups, among working, non-pregnant adults(ages 30-62). Statistical models controlled for age, education, marital status, household poverty-to-income ratio, and the number of months working at current job. The coefficient estimates were expressed as predictive margins. The study sample was comprised of 19,395 working adults. Among non-minority women, self-employment was negatively associated with obesity (% diff = -7.4%; p = 0.008), physical inactivity % diff = -7.0%; p = 0.017), and poor sleep duration (% diff = -9.4%; p = 0.004). Among minority women, self-employment was negatively associated with poor diet (% diff = -6.7%; p = 0.024), physical inactivity (% diff =-7.3%; p = 0.013) and poor sleep duration (% diff = -8.1%; p = 0.017). Among non-minority men, self-employment was negatively associated with poor diet (% diff = -6.5%; p = 0.008) and hypertension (% diff = -5.7%; p = 0.013). This study suggests that there may be a relationship between work context and CVD risk factors that varies across race, ethnicity and sex; however, further research is needed to characterize this relationship. Specifically, exploring how autonomy, flexibility, social support and discrimination exposure varies across self-employment status in diverse demographic groups may be important for illuminating the relationship between work and cardiovascular health.",BMC public health,2025-05-30,10.1186/s12889-025-22955-2,Kimberly Narain,José J Escarce,"Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, 1100 Glendon Ave, Suite 850 & 900, Los Angeles, CA, 90024, USA.

This study aims to determine patient factors associated with the need for more frequent TEP changes and maintenance in addition to TEP-associated complications. Patients who underwent TEP procedure were identified in the TriNetX Research Network. Cohorts were stratified by comorbidities, including diabetes, GERD, esophageal stricture, hypo/hyperthyroidism, tobacco and alcohol use, radiation history, and primary versus secondary TEP. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed time to prosthesis change, and risks of complications, including fistula formation, local infection, prosthesis leak, aspiration pneumonia, and dysphagia, were calculated. Among 4145 patients identified, diabetes was associated with increased risk of prosthesis leak and dysphagia. Hypothyroidism, GERD, and esophageal strictures were linked to higher rates of fistula formation, infection, prosthesis leak, aspiration pneumonia, and dysphagia. Primary TEP was associated with increased fistula and infection rates compared to secondary TEP. Radiation and tobacco use were significantly associated with dysphagia, and tobacco and alcohol use with higher infection and aspiration risks. Average time to TEP change was 72 days. Patients with GERD (HR 1.17, 95 % CI [1.06-1.29]) and esophageal stricture (HR 1.13, 95 % CI [1.02-1.26]) required more frequent prosthesis changes.

40455102,"Folate intake, tissue levels, and colorectal cancer deaths in a national cohort established before folic acid fortification.","The relationship between folate and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains inconclusive. To control for the interference from folic acid fortification, we assessed the relationship between folate intake, serum folate, and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels and the risk of CRC death in a cohort established before fortification. We analyzed the data of 14,528 adults aged 19 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) as the baseline examination and were followed through December 31, 2006. Hazard ratios (HR) of CRC deaths were estimated for individuals with different folate intake and biomarker levels. Covariates included age, sex, family income, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, serum cotinine, vitamin supplements, and dietary energy intake. After 192,973 person-years (pys) of follow-up with a mean of 14 years, 78 CRC deaths were recorded.

40455496,Assessing availability of depression severity indicators in electronic health record data: A retrospective study in two large academic health care systems in the United States.,"The high prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) combined with low treatment response supports continued research in this area. Electronic health records (EHR) are an important real-world data source for such MDD research, yet indicators of depression severity, a key confounder, are unreliably available. We examined the availability of depression severity indicators in the EHR and identified patient characteristics associated with having a severity indicator available for patients with an MDD diagnosis. We leveraged EHR data from academic health systems in Colorado and Utah from 2016 to 2021 to calculate the proportion of MDD encounters with a severity indicator from two sources in the EHR (diagnosis codes and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total scores). We compared characteristics between patients with and without severity indicators using chi-square and t tests. We also estimated the proportional agreement between the two sources of severity. Among 1.55 million encounters with an MDD diagnosis from 2016 to 2021, 38% had a severity indicator available from the diagnosis code or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score. Availability increased from 28% in 2016 to 47% in 2021. Overall agreement was low at the MDD encounter level. Hispanic patients and those with anxiety, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorder were more likely to have a severity indicator. While availability of depression severity in EHR data is increasing, it remains low. Researchers wanting to use depression severity data from the EHR should be cognizant of the potential impact of missing severity on their research and be cautious about using diagnosis codes and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores as indicators of severity in isolation.

40455735,Association of initiating CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with risks of adverse outcomes in older adults receiving antidepressants: A retrospective cohort study.,"The safety of pharmacokinetic opioid-antidepressant interactions may be affected by the sequence in which the drug is initiated. Previous literature showed that initiation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants concomitantly with existing CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction) was associated with heightened risks of adverse outcomes (e.g., worsening pain). However, little is known about whether and to what extent the risks exist when CYP2D6-metabolized opioids are initiated on existing antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction), a more common pattern of concomitant use of these two drugs. The study aims to examine the association of initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with risks of adverse outcomes among older nursing home residents who already received antidepressants. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a 100% Medicare nursing home sample linked to Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021. Participants included long-term care residents 65 years of age or older who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants for at least 30 days. The key exposure was the use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, with day 1 of antidepressant-opioid concomitant use designated as cohort entry. Patients were followed from cohort entry until the end of 1 year, nursing home discharge, death, or study end (12/31/2021). Seven adverse outcomes included worsening pain, physical function, and depression, and counts of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose (OD). We identified 127,200 older nursing home long-term residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants (mean [SD] age, 84.4 [8.7] years). After covariate adjustment via inverse probability of treatment weighting, use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with a higher risk of worsening pain (relative risk:1.04 [95% CI, 1.02, 1.06]; P < 0.001; risk difference (RD): 1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%, 1.6%]) and a higher incidence rate of pain-related hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR]:1.13 [95% CI, 1.04, 1.22]; P = 0.003; RD: 1.21 [95% CI, 0.39, 1.89] per 1,000 patient-years) and pain-related ED visits (IRR = 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07, 1.29]; P = 0.003; RD: 0.85 [95% CI, 0.29, 1.41] per 1,000 patient-years), with no difference in physical function, depression, OUD, and OD. Main study limitations included unmeasured confounding and limited generalizability. This cohort study of older nursing home residents showed that initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with increased risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalizations, and pain-related ED visits, although the relative and absolute risks are small to moderate. Clinicians should be aware of potential worsening pain and hospital and ED visits due to pain among patients who used CYP2D6-metabolizing opioids concomitantly with antidepressants, particularly those with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants.",PLoS medicine,2025-06-01,10.1371/journal.pmed.1004620,Yu-Jung Jenny Wei,Stephan Schmidt,"Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Community Health and Family Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Statistics, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Neurology, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.","Humans, Analgesics, Opioid, Aged, Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6, Antidepressive Agents, Male, Retrospective Studies, Female, Aged, 80 and over, Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors, Drug Interactions, United States, Nursing Homes, Medicare",N/A

Whether exposure to ozone concentrations consistently below current U.S. regulatory limits (70 ppb, 8-hour average) is associated with newly-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear, especially among demographic subgroups. We examined associations between residential ozone and incident COPD in a large prospective cohort study in the U.S., and assessed heterogeneity by demographic subgroups. The All of Us research program followed >848,000 volunteers enrolled in 2017-2023. Among 596, 926 participants whom consented to the release of EHR data, annual average ozone concentrations from satellite measurements from 2000-2016 were linked to residential location for 376,535 participants. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate associations between ozone and incident COPD over the study period, adjusting for co-exposures and potential confounders. We assessed effect modification using cross-product terms and stratified analyses with race, sex, age, income, and smoking status. To account for non-probabilistic sampling, we applied cell weighting based on the distribution of key factors from the 2018-2022 American Community Survey. We identified 7,907 incident COPD cases over an average 4-year follow-up. Residential ozone concentrations (Median: 37.75 ppb, Min-Max: 29.79-51.39) were similar across subgroups. Overall, we observed a positive, non-monotonic relationship between ozone and COPD risk, driven by the highest quartile of exposure (HR  Even consistently below U.S. regulatory limits, the respiratory effects of ozone were apparent independent of smoking.

40466339,Association between SSRI use and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and generalized anxiety disorder: A real-world cohort study.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly prevalent among CAD patients, worsening cardiovascular outcomes. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for anxiety disorders, their impact on cardiovascular prognosis in patients with CAD and GAD remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study utilized real-world data from the TriNetX database. Patients diagnosed with both CAD and GAD between 2016 and 2025 were included and categorized into SSRI users and non-users. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included individual MACE components and all-cause hospitalization. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. After 1:1 PSM, 54,526 SSRIs users and 54,526 non-users were analyzed. SSRIs use was significantly associated with a lower one-year risk of MACE (HR: 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.74-0.81, p < 0.001). Similar protective effects were observed across secondary outcomes and subgroups, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, and nicotine dependence. Landmark analyses confirmed consistent results. Negative control analyses showed no significant differences, minimizing bias. SSRIs use is associated with a lower one-year MACE rate in patients with CAD and GAD. These findings highlight the potential cardiovascular benefits of SSRIs in this population. Further clinical trials are warranted to validate these results and explore long-term effects.",Atherosclerosis,2025-06-02,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2025.120390,Jheng-Yan Wu,Yu-Min Lin,"Department of Nutrition, Chi Mei Medical Centre, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

40480966,Maternal Prenatal Cannabis Use and Major Structural Birth Defects.,"We evaluated associations between prenatal cannabis use and major structural birth defects of the child. This population-based retrospective cohort study comprised singleton births (January 2011-July 2020) universally screened for substance use at entrance to prenatal care. Prenatal cannabis use was defined as self-reported use or a positive toxicology test during pregnancy. Electronic health record and birth certificate data were used to identify 38 specific major structural birth defects within 8 organ systems (i.e., central nervous, eye, ear, cardiac, orofacial/respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary/renal, and musculoskeletal). Modified Poisson regression models were conducted adjusting for propensity scores. Of 363,952 infants, 22,494(6.2%) were exposed to maternal prenatal cannabis use, and 6094 infants (2.17%) had a major structural birth defect. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with gastroschisis in the unadjusted (RR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.25-3.19) and other non-cannabis prenatal substance use (aRR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.71) adjusted models, but not in the models adjusted for maternal age or the propensity score. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with omphalocele in the unadjusted model (RR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.42-6.48), maternal age-adjusted model (aRR = 3.54; 95% CI: 1.68-7.48), other prenatal substance use-adjusted model (aRR = 3.31; 95% CI: 1.50-7.31), and propensity score adjusted model (aRR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.26-6.77). Cases of gastroschisis and omphalocele were rare: n = 172 (0.05%) and n = 48 (0.01%), respectively. No associations emerged between maternal prenatal cannabis use and any other birth defects. Findings were replicated when cannabis was defined by toxicology testing only. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with an increased risk for gastroschisis and omphalocele.

Globally, there is considerable variability in reported rates of mental disorders among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), limiting timely intervention and evidence-based treatment among this population. We estimate the prevalence of specific mental disorders among individuals with a concurrent OUD using population-level administrative data in British Columbia, Canada.MethodA population-based retrospective observational study using individual-level linked health administrative data in British Columbia, Canada. Individuals with an OUD and concurrent mental disorder between January 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021, were included and followed from their first indication of OUD until censoring (death, administrative loss to follow-up, or August 31, 2021). We reported annual period (2013-2021) prevalence rates and age-standardized prevalence rates per 100,000 population (stratified by sex).ResultsThe population included 73,855 individuals (female 40.6%, median age, 36 [27-48]) with an OUD and concurrent mental disorder. During the observation period anxiety disorders were the most prevalent (91.7%) mental disorders followed by depression (73.6%), bipolar disorder (35.3%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (20.4%), and personality disorders (19.5%). Among the population, the annual period prevalence of any mental disorder increased from 35,603 in 2013 to 60,940 in 2021, with an average annual percent difference of 7.0%, driven by increases in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Overall, the annual age-standardized prevalence of any mental disorder was higher among males.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a steadily growing prevalence of people with OUD and a concurrent mental disorder and emphasize the need for access to mental disorder treatment among this population.

40495525,Telehealth Prescribing of Stimulants for ADHD and Associated Risk for Later Stimulant and Substance Use Disorders.,"The authors sought to determine 1) whether receiving an initial stimulant prescription for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from a provider whom a patient has never seen in person is associated with increased risk for stimulant use disorder (stimUD) or other substance use disorders (SUDs), and 2) whether receiving an initial stimulant prescription during a telehealth versus in-person appointment is associated with increased risk for stimUD or SUD. This was a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from March 1, 2020, to August 25, 2023, from a not-for-profit, academically affiliated medical system in the Northeastern United States. Eligible study subjects were ≥12 years old with ADHD and initial receipt of any stimulant prescription during the study period. Exclusion criteria included a non-nicotine SUD diagnosis at the time of initial stimulant prescription. The sample included 7,944 patients. After adjustment for covariates, a purely telehealth-based relationship versus any in-person relationship did not significantly alter risk for SUD (adjusted odds ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.60, 1.20) or stimUD (adjusted odds ratio=1.28, 95% CI=0.34, 4.85). A telehealth versus in-person appointment at the time of the initial stimulant prescription did not significantly alter risk for subsequent SUD (adjusted odds ratio=1.15, 95% CI=0.92, 1.44) but was associated with significantly higher risk for stimUD (adjusted odds ratio=6.18, 95% CI=1.34, 28.46). The results suggest that receipt of a stimulant prescription for ADHD via telehealth does not alter the risk for SUD, but receipt of an initial stimulant prescription via telehealth may signal increased risk of subsequent stimUD.

Analysis of the temporal trends and geographic variation in racial differences in the use of revascularization and major amputation may identify areas for targeted intervention. To investigate differences in the treatment of PAD between Black and White patients over time and by US state. This cohort study examined data for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a PAD diagnosis between 2018 and 2022. Data were analyzed from November 14, 2023, to February 13, 2025. Black and White race. The proportions of Black and White patients with PAD undergoing revascularization and major amputation were compared over time and by state. Data were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, chronic kidney disease, and county-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The total sample size was 2 376 300 beneficiaries (1 224 537 men [51.5%]). Black patients (219 338 [9.2%]) were slightly younger than White patients (2 156 962 [90.8%]; mean [SD] age, 75.8 [7.9] years vs 76.9 [7.8] years; P < .001) and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. A higher proportion of Black patients (8.9%) than White patients (7.6%) underwent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.18-1.21]; P < .001), and a higher proportion of Black patients (2.8%) than White patients (1.0%) underwent major amputation (odds ratio, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.83-2.99]; P < .001). Higher proportions of Black patients than White patients underwent revascularization and major amputation in the majority of states, although with marked variation in these proportional differences across states. The proportions of Black and White patients who underwent revascularization decreased over time (from 8.0% to 7.4% for Black patients and from 6.8% to 6.2% for White patients). The proportion of Black patients who underwent major amputation decreased (from 2.9% to 2.5%; P < .001), but there was no change among White patients (from 0.7% to 0.7%; P = .53). Revascularization correlated weakly (ρ = 0.10), and amputation correlated moderately with SVI (ρ = 0.46). These findings suggest that higher proportions of Black patients than White patients undergo invasive procedures for PAD, with considerable variation across states.

40498869,A retrospective cohort study evaluating the association between opioid and alcohol-related emergency department presentations and the subsequent risk of hospitalization.,"Our objective was to evaluate the association between two types of substance use presentations in the emergency department (ED) (opioid and alcohol) and the subsequent risk of hospital admission. The study is a retrospective observational cohort study using administrative data from all patients presenting with substance use disorder (SUD) at Health Sciences North (HSN) from January 1, 2018, to August 31, 2023. Patients were placed in two groups: those with alcohol-related presentations and those with opioid-related presentations. The outcome was the time and number of ED visits between the index ED visit and first admission to the hospital for the substance-related presentation. A total of 5,240 individuals (45.98%) presented with opioid use, and 6,140 individuals (45.61%) presented with alcohol use. The opioid group was younger (mean age = 36.86 years, compared to 44.58 years in the alcohol group) and had higher rates of current homelessness (37.47% vs. 9.63%), a higher prevalence of mental disorders (15.71% vs. 10.68%), and a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cellulitis (5.24% vs. 0.52%). Despite similarities in 30-day ED revisits (41.53% for alcohol vs. 40.88% for opioids) and mean length of stay (12.16 days for opioids vs. 10.04 days for alcohol), individuals in the opioid group had a higher likelihood of inpatient admission with each additional ED visit (hazard ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.19, 1.37]). Our findings highlight the healthcare needs of individuals presenting to the ED with opioid use versus alcohol use, with opioid-related cases involving more acute and complex healthcare presentations.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0325083,Kristen A Morin,Tara Leary,"Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; ICES North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Social Accountability, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; ICES North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Social Accountability, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Science North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.","Humans, Emergency Service, Hospital, Female, Male, Retrospective Studies, Adult, Hospitalization, Middle Aged, Opioid-Related Disorders, Risk Factors, Analgesics, Opioid",N/A

However, limited evidence on substance use-related healthcare visits exists among this population. Using population data for Ontario, Canada, this study aims to examine overall and substance use-specific healthcare visits for individuals with and without known provincial criminal justice system involvement (CJI versus non-CJI, respectively). This retrospective study compared overall and substance use-related healthcare visits between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2020 among provincially-incarcerated individuals (CJI group) versus those without criminal justice involvement (non-CJI group). Both groups were identified through available health administrative data and were individually matched by age, sex and material deprivation. The authors identified and matched 208,188 individuals (59.9% male) with and without CJI and a healthcare visit. Compared to the non-CJI group, those with CJI had approximately 20 times the rate of healthcare visits for alcohol use, drug use and illicit drug-related overdoses. Among those with CJI, females had a higher prevalence of overall healthcare visits, whereas males had a higher prevalence of substance use-specific visits. Findings highlight the high number of healthcare visits for substance use-related needs among individuals with CJI in Ontario. These results can inform efforts to enhance correctional release planning, improve access to community-based treatment and strengthen substance use prevention and treatment interventions for this high-risk population.

40504508,Persistent prescription opioid use and all-cause mortality following the first-year breast cancer survivorship.,"Harm associated with persistent opioid use beyond the first-year intensive cancer treatment is underinvestigated in cancer survivors. We examined rates and risk factors for persistent opioid use and all-cause mortality after the first-year breast cancer survivorship. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California for women diagnosed with a nonmetastatic breast cancer between 2009 and 2019 who filled 2 or more opioid prescriptions. Rates of persistent opioid use were estimated from first-year survivorship through December 31, 2021. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with persistent use were estimated using a multivariable Poisson regression model. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality associated with persistent opioid use were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Of 14 347 eligible individuals (mean [SD] age = 61.9 [12.5]), 2285 (15.9%) developed persistent opioid use, with an incident rate of 25.5 per 1000 person-years. Risk factors included older age (≥65 vs < 65 years: RR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.14), smoking (current: 1.89, 1.68 to 2.13; former: 1.30, 1.20 to 1.41), baseline comorbidities (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 5+ vs 0: 1.70, 1.29 to 2.24), and substance use disorders (1.58, 1.43 to 1.74). All-cause mortality was doubled among individuals with persistent use (51.6, 48.0 to 55.6 per 1000 person-years) than in those without (25.3, 24.2 to 26.4). Persistent use was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 1.84, 1.66 to 2.04). Persistent opioid use was common in breast cancer survivors and associated with increased mortality.

40506013,Association between buprenorphine adherence for opioid use disorder and clinical events and healthcare spending among older patients.,"Buprenorphine adherence in older adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) remains underexplored. This study investigated the associations between buprenorphine adherence and risks of opioid overdose, hospitalization, and healthcare spending among older adults to help inform practice and policy. In this retrospective cohort study, we utilized the Merative MarketScan® Database (2017-2019) to identify Medicare Advantage enrollees with OUD who initiated buprenorphine and were retrospectively followed for 180 days. We classified patients as adherent (Proportion of Days Covered ≥0.80) or non-adherent to buprenorphine. We balanced baseline characteristics between groups using an inverse probability treatment weighting approach. We then evaluated the associations between adherence and the risks of opioid overdose and all-cause hospitalization using discrete-time survival and Cox proportional hazards models respectively. Finally, we estimated differences in healthcare spending between adherent and non-adherent patients using generalized linear models. The cohort included 631 patients (379 [60 %] male; mean (SD) age:67 [2.8] years). Among them, 437 (69 %) were adherent to buprenorphine. Patients with a history of chronic pain, mental health disorders, and diabetes were less likely to adhere while higher average daily doses of buprenorphine were associated with increased adherence. Adherence was associated with reduced risks of opioid overdose (HR:0.76; 95%CI:0.59-0.93) and hospitalization (HR:0.55; 95%CI:0.42-0.73). Healthcare spending among adherent patients was $40,200 [95%CI:$54,712-25,687]) lower than in non-adherent patients. These findings were consistent across robustness and sensitivity analyses. Buprenorphine adherence was associated with reduced risks of opioid overdose, hospitalization, and healthcare spending in the overall population of older individuals with OUD. Enhancing adherence to buprenorphine should be prioritized in OUD treatment strategies among this population.",Journal of substance use and addiction treatment,2025-06-10,10.1016/j.josat.2025.209740,Olajumoke A Olateju,J Douglas Thornton,"Prescription Drug Misuse Education and Research Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, TX, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, TX, USA.

40512511,Early School Medicaid Expansions and Health Services for Children With Parental Opioid Use Disorder.,"Children experiencing parental opioid use disorder are a growing population at heightened risk of physical and mental health issues over the life course. Yet these children are less likely to receive comprehensive, ongoing health care and their parents are more likely to report barriers to access health care for their children. School-based health services have potential to overcome some of these health care access barriers, including parental burden, transportation, time, costs, and health care discontinuity. In 2014, Medicaid revoked its longstanding free care rule, expanding the scope of school-based health services eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Subsequently, some states began to expand their school Medicaid programs to benefit from the new federal rule. To estimate the early effects of state school Medicaid expansions on the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services among children who have experienced parental opioid use disorder. This cohort study using nationwide Medicaid claims data included Medicaid-enrolled children aged 5 to 18 years who experienced parental opioid use disorder at any point before age 19 years. A difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered implementation of school Medicaid expansions between 2014 and 2019 was used. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and January 2025. Children living in states implementing (treatment group) and not implementing (comparison group) school Medicaid expansions, before and after state-specific expansion dates. Binary measures indicating receipt of school-based health services, primary care, prevention, rehabilitative, dental, and mental health services, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospital stays. The sample comprised 6 628 404 person-years from 1 700 304 children. The mean (SD) age was 10.5 (3.9) years and 3 371 918 (51%) were male. School Medicaid expansions increased the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services by 8.9 percentage points (pp; P = .01). Growth was primarily driven by school claims for nursing services (difference, 7.4 pp; P = .02) and for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment services (difference, 8.6 pp; P = .04). Reductions in emergency department visits among children aged 5 to 11 years were also documented (difference, -1.8 pp; P = .02). This cohort study found that, given the complex health and health care needs of children growing up amid the opioid crisis, integrating health care into schools may offer a promising policy solution.",JAMA health forum,2025-06-07,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1288,Angélica Meinhofer,Maria Fitzpatrick,"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.; School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.; Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Jeb E.

We evaluated the baseline characteristics and outcomes (exacerbation rate, mortality, and healthcare resource utilization [HCRU]) of this COPD population, overall and by smoking status. A retrospective real-world cohort study of US patients was conducted using Optum's deidentified Market Clarity Data, an integrated claims and electronic health record database (study period: 2015-2019). Patients eligible for inclusion were aged ≥40 years, with a COPD diagnosis, continuous 12-month (baseline) period of treatment with TT, and record of ≥2 moderate or ≥1 severe exacerbation during baseline. Follow-up was either variable (from end of baseline to death, loss to follow-up, or end of 2019) or fixed (12 months). Baseline characteristics and treatment patterns, crude incidence rates (IRs) for exacerbations and mortality (per 100 person-years [PYs]; variable follow-up), and HCRU and costs (12-month follow-up) were summarized descriptively. Of 4,920 patients in the TT cohort, mean (SD) age was 62.3 (9.7) years, 60.9% were female, and 68.0% were white; 46.5% of TT cohort patients with a history of smoking were current smokers. Hypertension (92.7%), ischemic heart disease (52.1%), and heart failure (40.1%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities. Most patients received oral corticosteroids (89.6%) or antibiotics (92.8%) for exacerbation management during baseline. Add-on therapies included phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (10.4%) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (26.4%). During follow-up, IRs (95% CI) were 108.2 (104.7-111.8) per 100 PY for any moderate/severe exacerbation and 8.0 (7.4-8.6) per 100 PY for mortality. Exacerbation risk was similar by smoking status. During the 12-month follow-up, mean (SD) all-cause and COPD costs were $63,178 ($77,061) and $26,153 ($47,085), respectively. There is high mortality and considerable HCRU and healthcare costs incurred by people with COPD experiencing frequent moderate/severe exacerbations while on TT.

We performed a retrospective observational study using a database containing all hospitalizations registered in Portuguese public hospitals from 2008 to 2015. Hospitalizations with a primary or secondary diagnosis of BD were selected. To compare episodes with and without a diagnosis of SUD, an independent sample  SUD was registered in 11.3% of episodes, with alcohol use disorder being the most prevalent (5.8%). A non-linear increase in the number of hospitalizations throughout the study period was found. Episodes with a concomitant register of SUD were associated with younger (44.1 ± 12.5 years old) and male hospitalizations (56.6%), shorter length of stay (LoS) (15.0 (8.0;24.0) days), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (0.24 ± 0.76), and with higher rates of attention-deficit, conduct, and disruptive behavior disorders, personality disorders, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury, compared to those without this comorbidity.

40532747,Alcohol use disorder exacerbates clinical and vascular risks differentially in psychiatric disorders.,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern with detrimental effects on cognitive and neurological function, yet its impact on psychiatric populations remains incompletely defined. In this global propensity score-matched cohort study, we examined the clinical and vascular consequences of comorbid alcohol abuse across diverse psychiatric disorders. Data from the TriNetX network, encompassing electronic medical records from 143 healthcare organizations, were analyzed. For each disorder-anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, reaction to severe stress, eating disorders, personality disorders, psychoactive substance dependence, developmental disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-patients with alcohol abuse were matched 1:1 to those without, controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Over a 1095-day follow-up, outcomes evaluated included emergency department visits, pain prevalence, mortality, and cerebrovascular events (transient ischemic attacks and strokes). Alcohol abuse was consistently associated with significantly higher emergency care utilization, increased somatic pain, and elevated mortality across all groups. For instance, anxiety and depression cohorts exhibited 8.1% and 7.3% higher emergency visits and increased mortality by 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively, while schizophrenia showed a twofold increase in stroke risk and markedly higher pain (risk ratio 2.21). These results underscore that AUD exacerbates clinical and vascular risks in psychiatric patients, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2025-06-16,10.1016/j.alcohol.2025.06.003,Eva Christina Meyer,Younes Adam Tabi,"Department for Internal Medicine, Schön Klinik Eckernförde, Schleswiger Str. 114, 24340 Eckernförde, Germany.; Department for Neurology, University Medical Centre Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Str 3, 24105 Kiel, Germany.

40537088,Health Services Usage in Patients Receiving Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder or Long-Term Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Patients using buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) or long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain are at risk for poor outcomes if care is interrupted. Both treatments are highly regulated, with prepandemic requirements for in-person care. COVID-19 may have resulted in barriers to accessing in-person care through disruptions in care delivery. However, there were also opportunities for improved access to telemedicine visits through policy changes. This study aims to evaluate changes in health care and telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic among patients using buprenorphine for OUD and long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. We used administrative claims data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. We included patients using buprenorphine for OUD or long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain compared to patients with another chronic condition without similar prescribing restrictions: serious mental illness. We evaluated changes in in-person and telemedicine care by comparing rates of services by physician specialty, type of service, and the percentage of visits through telemedicine. Changes in usage were measured using a difference-in-differences approach with Poisson regression. The results are presented as incident rate ratios (IRR). We found declines in in-person visits in April 2020 across the buprenorphine, chronic opioids, and serious mental illness cohorts. The largest declines were for specialties that rely on in-person treatment, such as emergency medicine (IRR range 0.60-0.62), orthopedics (IRR 0.48-0.52), cardiology (IRR 0.64-0.78), and oncology (IRR 0.77-0.81). In contrast, there were smaller declines for specialties that could more easily transition to telemedicine, namely family practice (IRR 0.80-0.92), mental health (IRR 0.92-1.01), and pain medicine (IRR 0.87-1.08). The percentage of telemedicine visits for these specialties ranged from 30% to 51% in the period. There were also large declines for specific services, including emergency medicine (IRR 0.53-0.89), physical therapy (IRR 0.24-0.72), and new office visits (IRR 0.38-0.64). By January 2022, usage was similar to prepandemic levels, but the percentage of telemedicine visits remained elevated for family practice (10%-14%), mental health (34%-43%), and pain medicine (11%-15%) through January 2022. The results were similar across the cohorts, although in April 2020 there was a modest decrease (IRR 0.87) for pain medicine in the serious mental illness cohort, but the differences were not significant for the buprenorphine (IRR 1.08) and chronic opioids (IRR: 0.99) cohorts. These findings highlight the value of telemedicine to maintain access among people at risk for poor outcomes if care is interrupted.

40540004,"Assessing the Risk Factors for Surgical Site and Deep Wound Infections Following Hip Arthroscopy: A Nationwide Study of 75,577 Patients.","The indications and utilization of hip arthroscopic surgery have increased over the past decade owing to advances in surgical technique. Although generally rare, surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common postoperative complications following this procedure. This study used a nationwide database to assess the incidence and risk factors for SSIs following arthroscopic hip surgery. Following a retrospective query of a nationwide administrative claims database for adults (>18 years old) undergoing primary hip arthroscopy from 2010 to 2021, patients were categorized into two cohorts based on whether they did (N = 235) or did not (N = 75,342) develop an SSI within 90 days of surgery. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratio (OR) of developing SSIs within 90 days following hip arthroscopy, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities comprising the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The overall incidence of SSIs following hip arthroscopy was 0.31%, with no notable change over the study period (P = 0.697). The two cohorts were similar in age (P = 0.0716), sex (P = 0.2959), and geographic location (P = 0.5995). Overall comorbidity burden was markedly higher among patients who did (ECI = 4.1) versus those who did not (ECI = 2.2) develop SSIs (P < 0.0001). Risk factors for SSIs following hip arthroscopy included depression (OR: 2.02, P < 0.0001), preoperative fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (OR: 1.81, P = 0.0001), history of drug abuse (OR: 1.74, P = 0.00098), and coagulopathy (OR: 1.58, P = 0.0312). Substratification demonstrated that morbidly obese patients (≥35.00 kg/m2) were more likely to develop SSIs (OR: 4.52, P < 0.0001) compared with patients of normal body mass index. The overall rate of SSIs is low following hip arthroscopy. Certain patient-specific factors may be associated with SSIs and warrant further understanding to prevent these occurrences. This study may guide careful and intentional patient selection and optimization before hip arthroscopy, in efforts to reduce the rate of this event.

40540313,Cannabinoids and Adverse Convulsive Effects: A Pharmacovigilance and Addictovigilance Analysis of Cases Reported in France.,"Seizures after the use of cannabinoids are reported, but no precise descriptions of the characteristics of subjects and factors that may trigger seizures are available. To study the characteristics and circumstances associated with the occurrence of seizures in individuals using cannabinoids for medical or recreational purposes. A retrospective analysis of spontaneous reports of adverse drug effects issued by the French pharmacovigilance and addictovigilance systems, and by manufacturers, extracted data from the Eudravigilance database (01/01/1985-21/07/2023). The request used the broad MedDRA SMQ term 'convulsive', with all products containing cannabinoids (THC, CBD, cannabis or natural cannabinoids). Among 4296 notifications with cannabinoids, 130 (3%) reports of convulsive effects were analysed: 29 cases (23.3%) related to medical use (27 CBD, 1 THC and 2 combined THC/CBD preparations) and 98 (75.4%) related to recreational use. The median age was 29.0 years (min-max: 3-75), 78.7% were men and 81.1% were serious cases. Among the recreational users, 38.8% used Cannabis sativa with a history of epilepsy, and 68.4% of them were taking antiepileptics. In total, 67.7% of individuals had at least one risk factor for seizures, i.e., 31.0% among medical users and 78.6% among recreational users. The main risk factors with medical use were inefficacy of CBD (17.2%), fatigue (13.8%) and concomitant epileptogenic medications (10.3%). The main risk with recreational use was concomitant epileptogenic medications (39.8%), consumption of illicit drugs (33.7%) and alcohol (32.7%). This analysis demonstrates the importance of alerting cannabinoid users, particularly recreational cannabis users and those with a history of epilepsy, about seizure-associated risks.

40540787,"""Are you worried about going into withdrawal today?"" Retrospective analysis of single-question, patient-centered screen for substance use and care linkage.","Emergency Department (ED) screening for substance use disorder (SUD) is limited by a lack of standardization and challenging clinical environments. Existing tools may be focused on informing clinicians rather than supporting patients. This study assessed a novel single-question screening tool to identify patients at risk of withdrawal and link those with opioid use disorder (OUD) to standardized treatment. A cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted at two urban EDs in Philadelphia, PA, using electronic health record data between November 8, 2022, and February 28, 2025. Patients were included in the study if they arrived ambulatory to the emergency department, were aged 18 years and older, and able to answer screening questions. Demographic, encounter, screening response, disposition, and withdrawal order set utilization data were obtained. Data analysis was primarily descriptive, and bivariate associations were examined using odds ratios to assess the strength of relationships between key variables. 106,212 patient encounters met the inclusion criteria during the study period. 70,603 (66.5 %) of those patients answered the screening question. 4686 (6.6 %) patients answered affirmatively to a concern over withdrawal. 1512 patients (2.1 %) received medications from the opioid withdrawal order set, including 186 patients who did not express a withdrawal concern. Screening positive for a withdrawal concern was associated with a 2.28-fold increase in the odds of patient-directed discharge from the ED (OR = 2.28, 95 % CI = 2.10-2.47, p < .001). Patients who received the withdrawal protocol had significantly lower rates of patient-directed discharge (9.1 %) compared to those who screened positive for withdrawal overall (17.8 %) (OR = 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.51, p < .001). Use of a single-question ED screening tool to identify individuals in withdrawal and link them to withdrawal treatments may be an effective tool.

40541494,Opioid Use in Patients With Testicular Cancer: Patterns and Risk Factors.,"Prescription opioid use is a gateway to chronic dependence and associated morbidity and mortality. Research has demonstrated that men receiving narcotics after urologic surgery are at increased risk of persistent opioid use. However, factors associated with persistent use in testicular cancer patients specifically are poorly understood. The Truven Marketscan database was queried for patients with testicular cancer who underwent orchiectomy between 2009 and 2021. Patients who were under 18 years old, lacked insurance coverage during the study period, filled opioid prescriptions 3 months prior to orchiectomy, or had prior opioid use disorder diagnoses were excluded. Subgroup analysis was performed by receipt of advanced treatment, defined as chemotherapy and/or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Opioid exposure was defined as receipt of ≥ 1 opioid prescriptions within 30 days of last treatment. Among those who underwent advanced treatment, pretreatment opioid use over the cohort median in oral morphine equivalents (OME) was included in the definition of opioid exposure. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with our primary outcome: ≥ 1 filled opioid prescription between 31 to 90 days and 91 to 180 days after last treatment. Of 5409 total patients, 2115 (39.1%) underwent advanced treatment: 1697 (31.4%) chemotherapy, 185 (3.4%) RPLND, and 223 (4.3%) chemotherapy and RPLND (combination). Opioid exposure was associated with a filled opioid prescription at 31 to 90 (OR 4.67) and 91 to 180 days (OR 4.74, both P < .001) after last treatment. On multivariate analysis, chemotherapy and combination therapy, but not RPLND alone, were independently associated with opioid use at 31 to 180 days post-treatment (P < .001). Testicular cancer patients who received opioid prescriptions after orchiectomy were more likely to require additional opioid prescriptions 31 to 180 days after treatment. Advanced treatment with chemotherapy alone or combined with RPLND, but not RPLND alone, increased the opioid dependence.",Clinical genitourinary cancer,2025-05-29,10.1016/j.clgc.2025.102381,Siddharth Marthi,Shreyas S Joshi,"Department of Urology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.

40543828,Opioid Consumption Patterns Before and After Elective Joint Surgery.,"Opioid use is associated with multiple risks, including accidental overdose and addiction. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty are among the most common elective procedures. The goal of surgery is to relieve patients of their joint pain and reduce dependence on analgesics, but these procedures can result in chronic opioid use. This retrospective analysis occurred at Kaiser Permanente Washington between March 2018 and May 2023. A preoperative opioid user was defined as a patient who had filled two or more opioid prescriptions in the 3-month preoperative period. A Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between preoperative opioid use and continued use of opioids 10 to 12 months postoperatively. Of 8,886 patients who underwent a TKA or total hip arthroplasty, 24% were considered preoperative opioid users. The average age was 68 years, and 59% of patients were women. Over the study period, the total number of opioid prescriptions filled was 43,326. At 10 to 12 months postoperatively, 39% of preoperative opioid users continued using opioids compared with 9% of nonchronic opioid users (P < 0.05). Exploratory analysis showed factors associated with a higher likelihood of persistent opioid use 10 to 12 months postoperatively include women and undergoing a TKA procedure. Understanding opioid utilization after total joint arthroplasty is essential to identifying strategies to minimize overprescribing and promote rational opioid use. Approximately 39% of preoperative opioid users and 9% of nonchronic opioid users continued use of opioids for 10 to 12 months after surgery. Specific patient characteristics were associated with the development of persistent postoperative opioid use. Although this study did not include multivariate analysis, which limits the conclusions we can draw from this data, the magnitude of the trends noted is large enough to warrant further studies.",The Journal of arthroplasty,2025-06-19,10.1016/j.arth.2025.06.053,Melina Martinez,Edwin Lojeski,"Specialty Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Specialty Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Pharmacy Programs - Pain Management, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Pain Medicine Physician, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.",N/A,"arthroplasty, opioids, pain, pain management, postoperative pain"
40548290,Long-term risk of diabetes following hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: A retrospective cohort study.,"The impact of varying degrees of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) on the risk of developing diabetes later in life is currently unknown. To assess the long-term risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), prediabetes, and mortality that are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX United States Collaborative Network to examine outcomes, especially T2DM, prediabetes and mortality, related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in females aged 21-45. Participants had no history of hypertension or diabetes before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. Propensity score matching was applied to balance covariates such as gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, overweight/obesity, nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse, and healthcare utilization. This ensured comparability between groups and reduced potential confounding in outcome evaluation. This study included 318544 females aged 21-45 with and without PIH. Females with PIH had higher risks of T2DM [hazard ratio (HR): 1.907, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.821-1.998), prediabetes (HR: 1.610, 95%CI: 1.537-1.687), and mortality (HR: 1.501, 95%CI: 1.361-1.655) over a follow-up of up to 18 years. Incidence rates for T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality were 3.2%, 2.7%, and 0.6%, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the presence of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia increased risks across all outcomes. Persistent hypertension beyond 12 weeks postpartum was linked to more than a 3-fold increase in mortality. Preventative aspirin use during pregnancy did not reduce the risks of T2DM, prediabetes, or mortality among those with PIH. PIH significantly increases the long-term risks of T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for improved long-term management strategies to enhance overall health in such individuals.",World journal of diabetes,2025-06-15,10.4239/wjd.v16.i6.105080,Yu-Hsiang Shih,Chia-Chi Lung,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung City 40705, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Health Nursing Center, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan. dinoljc@csmu.edu.tw.",N/A,"Eclampsia, Gestational hypertension, Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Mortality, Prediabetes, Preeclampsia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus"
40548404,Mortality and hospital admissions in people with eating disorders: longitudinal cohort study in secondary care-linked English primary care records.,"Research on mortality and admissions for physical health problems across eating disorder diagnoses in representative settings is scarce. Inequalities in these outcomes across a range of sociodemographic characteristics have rarely been investigated. We investigated whether people with eating disorders had greater all-cause mortality and physical health-related in-patient admissions compared with those without eating disorders, and whether associations varied by sex, ethnicity, deprivation, age and calendar year at diagnosis. Using primary care Clinical Research Practice Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, we matched people with an incident eating disorder diagnosis (any, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorders not otherwise specified, generic eating disorder or a referral code) from primary care Read codes to four people without eating disorders (1:4 matching) on year of birth, sex, primary care practice, year of registration and index date. We used univariable and multivariable Cox (mortality) and Poisson (admissions) models, and fitted interactions to investigate whether associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. We included 58 735 people (90.1% female, 91.6% White). People with any eating disorders had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.73-2.67). Anorexia nervosa had the highest mortality (hazard ratio: 3.49, 95% CI: 2.43-5.01).

Mortality and admission rate ratios were greater in males. People with eating disorders have high rates of mortality and physical health-related admissions.

Five primary care clinics at one academic medical center participated in this retrospective program evaluation conducted from October 2021 to December 2023. A physician champion led all implementation strategies for buprenorphine prescribing, including ""en bloc"" group engagement and training of physicians at clinic A; a limited set of implementation resources was later shared with clinic B. Clinics C-E served as controls. Electronic health record outcome measures from each clinic included (1) percent of clinicians prescribing buprenorphine, (2) number of buprenorphine prescriptions, (3) number of full opioid agonist prescriptions, and (4) percentage buprenorphine (PB) prescriptions defined as the number of buprenorphine prescriptions divided by the sum of the total number of buprenorphine and full mu-opioid agonist prescriptions. During the 2-year period at clinic A, all clinicians prescribed buprenorphine; there was a decrease in full agonist prescribing, and PB increased from 0% to 30.8%. PB increased also at Clinic B. Buprenorphine prescribing did not increase, full agonist prescribing was stable, and PB remained <10% at control clinics. These results show that a single physician can help other clinicians initiate and sustain buprenorphine prescribing. The PB metric, which includes full agonist prescribing along with buprenorphine, may be a particularly important quality metric for tracking implementation progress and quality improvement.",Journal of addiction medicine,2025-06-23,10.1097/ADM.0000000000001535,Thaddeus R Salmon,Michelle R Lofwall,"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (TRS); Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (AMS); Departments of Behavioral Science and Psychiatry, Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (MRL).",N/A,"buprenorphine, implementation science, office-based opioid treatment, opioid use disorder, quality improvement"
40549495,Management of Opioid Use Disorder Among Peripartum Individuals During Hospitalization.,"Peripartum opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health concern. Although hospital admission for labor and delivery is common, little is known about hospitalized peripartum individuals with OUD or their inpatient management. The purpose of this study was to characterize hospitalized peripartum individuals with OUD who were seen by an OUD consult service and to examine their inpatient OUD treatment. This was a retrospective cohort study of peripartum individuals who received an OUD consult from May 2020 to April 2022. All individuals were pregnant or up to 3 months postpartum at admission. Substance use and psychosocial history were collected, along with timing and acceptance of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and details of discharge transitions. Of the 23 peripartum individuals with OUD who received a consult during admission, 61% were white, 30% were black, and all were non-Hispanic. Most individuals (78%) had Medicaid. Only 30% were using MOUD at hospital admission. Two-thirds (63%) of those not using MOUD were started on treatment during hospitalization, most commonly with buprenorphine-naloxone. At discharge, most (74%) individuals were connected to outpatient OUD treatment. Of the total, 35% self-directed their discharge, and there was a higher proportion of self-directed discharges among those who did not receive inpatient MOUD compared with those who did (P < 0.01). Hospitalization during the peripartum period is an important opportunity for initiation of MOUD and linkage to longitudinal, community OUD services. Further understanding of factors contributing to high rates of self-directed discharge in the peripartum period is needed.",Journal of addiction medicine,2025-06-23,10.1097/ADM.0000000000001523,Shelby A Powers,Rebecca Lumsden,N/A,N/A,"medications for opioid use disorder, opioid use, pregnancy"
40555701,Risk factors for development of diabetic foot ulcer disease in two large contemporary UK cohorts.,"Diabetic foot ulcer disease (DFUD) is common, life-changing and associated with a lower 5-Year survival rate than many cancers. However, the risk factors for DFUD have generally been identified in small, single-centre, clinic-based studies, many of which are cross-sectional. This study aims to assess the incidence of DFUD and its related risk factors in two large, contemporary UK cohorts. We investigated common sociodemographic and clinical factors affecting the incidence rates of DFUD in two large representative independent cohorts of people with diabetes in England (CPRD, n = 131 042) and Scotland (Scottish Diabetes Research Network-National Diabetes Dataset [SDRN-NDS] n = 260 748). The methods of case ascertainment differed between the two cohorts: in England, both primary and secondary care data were used, whereas in Scotland, secondary care and foot clinic data were used. In the English cohort, 4.7% developed DFUD over a median of 4.3years (incidence rate 9.0[95%CI: 8.8-9.2] per 1000 person-years) follow-up; in the Scottish cohort, the equivalent figure was 2.9% over a median of 6.3 years (incidence rate 4.4 [95% CI: 4.3-4.5] per 1000 person-years). Despite different methods of case ascertainment, multivariable analysis in both populations indicated that those who developed DFUD were more likely to be older, male, smokers, of White ethnicity, with higher systolic blood pressure and baseline HbA1c. These findings provide a robust evidence base for identifying people with diabetes at risk of DFUD for targeted efforts for prevention.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2025-06-24,10.1111/dom.16519,Safoora Gharibzadeh,Edward Gregg,"Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Leicester, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, Leicester, UK, University of Glasgow, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; SCHARR, Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research, Division of Population Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; SCHARR, Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research, Division of Population Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Campus, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Derby, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; NHS Tayside, Scotland Dundee, UK, Scotland, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Division of Clinical Medicine, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Diabetes Research Unit, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Diabetes Research Centre, College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Centre for Population Health Sciences, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester, UK.; National Institute for Health Research Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Clarice Pears Building, Level 5 90 Byres Road, Glasgow, UK.; School of Population Health, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.",N/A,"cardiovascular disease, diabetes complications, real‐world evidence, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes"

40569592,Receipt of Buprenorphine and Naltrexone for Opioid Use Disorder by Race and Ethnicity and Insurance Type.,"Despite expanded efforts to improve treatment access, inequities exist in the receipt of medications for opioid use disorder by race and ethnicity and insurance type. To examine inequities in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-specifically buprenorphine and naltrexone-by race and ethnicity and insurance type after opioid-related health care events. This retrospective cohort study used data from the Institute for Health Equity Research Multi-Payor Claims Database, which includes more than 130 million individuals across commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage insurance plans. The cohort consisted of patients aged 18 years or older with an opioid use disorder (OUD)-related health care event (opioid-related overdose, infection, or treatment event) that occurred between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 2023 to December 2024. Race and ethnicity and insurance type, including commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage, were the primary exposures. The primary outcome was receipt of MOUD (buprenorphine or naltrexone) within 180 days of an OUD-related health care event. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of MOUD receipt with race and ethnicity and with insurance type, adjusting for demographic, clinical, time, and geographical covariates. Among 176 997 index events involving 164 728 patients between 2017 and 2022, the mean (SD) patient age was 40.0 (13.1) years; 104 005 (58.8%) involved men; 1083 events (0.6%) were among Asian patients, 23 424 (13.2%) were among Black patients, 10 302 (5.8%) were among Hispanic patients, 90 124 (50.9%) were among White patients, and 4697 (2.7%) were among patients of other race and ethnicity; and 147 257 (83.2%) were covered by Medicaid. Black (adjusted estimated probability, 17.1% [95% CI, 13.0%-21.1%]) and Hispanic (adjusted estimated probability, 16.2% [95% CI, 11.6%-20.8%]) patients were significantly less likely than White patients (adjusted estimated probability, 20.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-24.7%]) to receive buprenorphine (Black patients: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90]; adjusted risk difference [ARD], -3.4 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, -6.5 to -0.4 pp]; Hispanic patients: AOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.92]; ARD, -4.4 pp [95% CI, -9.1 to 0.4 pp]) but received naltrexone at similar rates. Patients with Medicaid (AOR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.14-1.69]; ARD, 3.5 pp [95% CI, 0.9-6.1 pp]) or Medicare Advantage (AOR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]; ARD, 3.6 pp [95% CI, -0.6 to 7.7 pp]) were more likely to receive buprenorphine compared with those with commercial insurance. Buprenorphine access improved incrementally from 2017 to 2022, reflecting recent clinical and policy changes; however, disparities persisted. In this cohort study of more than 17 600 opioid-related index health care events, race and ethnicity-based and insurance-based disparities in access to MOUD persisted despite efforts to expand treatment availability. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including culturally tailored care, expanded access points, and policy reforms to address structural barriers and reduce inequities contributing to the overdose crisis.",JAMA network open,2025-06-02,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.18493,Utsha G Khatri,Ka Ming Ngai,"Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.","Humans, Buprenorphine, Naltrexone, Male, Female, Opioid-Related Disorders, United States, Retrospective Studies, Middle Aged, Adult, Healthcare Disparities, Ethnicity, Narcotic Antagonists, Opiate Substitution Treatment, Medicaid, Insurance, Health, Racial Groups, Medicare Part C, Health Services Accessibility",N/A
40569596,Availability of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Opioid Treatment Programs.,"As the primary facilities authorized to dispense methadone, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are a critical access point for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, research is limited on the extent to which OTPs offer a broad range of MOUD and on the characteristics of programs that provide more comprehensive medication offerings. To assess the percentage of US OTPs offering all 3 forms of MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) and compare organizational and county characteristics of OTPs with different MOUD service offerings. This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data on a panel of OTPs listed in the annual National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Use Treatment Facilities from 2017 to 2023. Measures included the percentage of OTPs offering buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, or all 3 MOUD from 2017 to 2023 (assuming all OTPs offered methadone). Descriptive statistics on organizational and county characteristics of OTPs by MOUD offerings were collected. Three longitudinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of different MOUD offerings within OTPs, adjusting for organizational and county-level characteristics. This analysis included 10 298 facility-year observations, ranging from 1211 in 2017 to 1421 in 2023. From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of OTPs offering MOUD beyond methadone increased (buprenorphine: 811 [67.0%] in 2017 to 1209 [85.1%] in 2023; naltrexone: 463 [38.2%] in 2017 to 749 [52.7%] in 2023; all 3 MOUD: 402 [33.2%] in 2017 to 639 [45.0%] in 2023). OTPs offering all 3 MOUD (3985 [38.7%]) had significantly higher odds of accepting Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.67-2.74); offering peer services (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25-2.12), mental health services (AOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.80), and telemedicine services (AOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92); and being private nonprofit (AOR, 7.45; 95% CI, 4.67-11.87) or government operated (AOR, 41.83; 95% CI, 19.71-88.75) compared with private for profit. In this cross-sectional study of OTPs, although the availability of MOUD beyond methadone increased over time, most OTPs still did not offer all 3 forms of MOUD as of 2023. Specific organizational characteristics, such as being government operated and accepting Medicare, were associated with more comprehensive MOUD offerings. Future research should evaluate why OTPs vary in their MOUD offerings.",JAMA network open,2025-06-02,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.17616,Zoe Lindenfeld,Noa Krawczyk,"Edward J.

40569933,Trends of long-term opioid therapy and subsequent discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain in UK primary care: A retrospective cohort study.,"To examine trends of opioid use, focusing on long-term opioid therapy (L-TOT) and its discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Retrospective cohort study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum data. Incident opioid users (no opioid use in the prior year) with CNCP between 01/01/2009-31/12/2019. Among them, we identified L-TOT users (≥3 opioid prescriptions within 90 days, or total ≥90 supply days within the first year, excluding the initial 30 days) and L-TOT discontinuers (no opioid use for ≥180 days following a L-TOT). Yearly rates of incident opioid users (over CPRD-registered patients), L-TOT users (over incident opioid users), and L-TOT discontinuers (over L-TOT users) were calculated. Annual counts of each group were fitted using segmented negative binomial regression models with an offset considering their corresponding denominators from 2009 to 2019, excluding 2014 due to policy changes in that year. Among 2,839,161 incident opioid users, 11.4% (n = 324,877) transitioned into L-TOT users within one year, of which 4.8% (n = 15,484) discontinued. Between 2009-2013, rates of L-TOT users significantly declined by 2.6% (incidence rate ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.971 to 0.978) per annum, followed by a significant step change in 2015 (1.026, 1.009 to1.044), and a significant annual increase of 2.4% (1.024, 1.019 to 1.029) from 2015 to 2019, compared to the 2009-2013 trend. The annual rates of L-TOT discontinuers remained stable from 2009 to 2013 (0.987, 0.971 to 1.002), followed by a non-significant step change (0.990, 0.916 to 1.070) in 2015, and a significant decrease in slope by 2.6% (0.974, 0.951 to 0.998) per annum during 2015-2019, relative to 2009-2013. L-TOT has plateaued since 2015, accompanied with an accelerated decrease in discontinuation rates, suggesting ongoing reliance on opioids for CNCP management, despite increased awareness regarding L-TOT associated risks. This is likely due to the limited availability of other effective pharmacological options and non-pharmacological alternatives, and challenges in their accessibility.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0326604,Qian Cai,Evangelos Kontopantelis,"Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Population Health, Health Services Research & Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; NIHR Greater Manchester Patient Safety Research Collaboration, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.","Humans, Analgesics, Opioid, Retrospective Studies, Female, United Kingdom, Male, Chronic Pain, Middle Aged, Primary Health Care, Aged, Adult, Opioid-Related Disorders",N/A
40577006,Postpartum Medicaid Use in Birthing Parents and Access to Financed Care.,"The American Rescue Plan of 2021 allowed states to expand pregnancy Medicaid coverage to 12 months post partum. How the new policy affects Medicaid coverage and health care utilization is largely unknown. To quantify insurance coverage and care utilization for postpartum individuals under Medicaid policies that extended postpartum coverage to 12 months after delivery from 60 days. A retrospective study of Medicaid coverage and utilization in North Carolina using Medicaid claims from March 2016 to December 2023 was conducted. All Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022 were included. A total of 3 periods were differentiated: before the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), during the PHE when there was a moratorium on Medicaid disenrollment, and after North Carolina adopted the 12-month postpartum extension through the American Rescue Plan of 2021. Length and type of postpartum Medicaid enrollment were evaluated. Utilization outcomes included indicators of (1) the receipt of at least 1 postpartum visit; (2) any contraceptive visit; (3) any primary care visit; (4) any outpatient mental health care, and (5) any outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) care. There were 353 957 Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022. During the postpartum extension, Medicaid recipients were more likely to have been continuously covered by comprehensive Medicaid at 12 months post partum (97.1% vs 26.5% pre-PHE). Beneficiaries in the extended coverage cohorts were substantially more likely to use Medicaid-financed care than those in the pre-PHE cohort for contraception (47.8% for the PHE cohort and 47.9% for the extension cohort vs 38.0% for the pre-PHE cohort), primary care (68.1% for the PHE cohort and 71.4% for the extension cohort vs 25.3% for the pre-PHE cohort), mental health (22.1% for the PHE cohort and 25.7% for the extension cohort vs 7.5% for the pre-PHE cohort) and substance use disorder visits (3.6% for the PHE cohort and 5.3% for the extension cohort vs 2.2%for the pre-PHE cohort) within 12 months, although there was evidence of delays in early postpartum and contraceptive visits. Results of this study suggest that extending Medicaid coverage for 12 months post partum was associated with expanded opportunities for greater access to Medicaid-financed medical and behavioral health care. Both prevention and ongoing treatment of chronic conditions may help mitigate key adverse outcomes. Findings may help policymakers and public health officials understand how extended coverage affects access to Medicaid-financed care.",JAMA health forum,2025-06-07,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1630,Jonas J Swartz,Marisa Elena Domino,"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.; Duke-Margolis Institute for Health Policy, Durham, North Carolina.; Cecil G.

40578797,Potential impact of peer support service on SUD treatment engagement following ED visits among Kentucky medicaid beneficiaries.,"Research indicates that peer support has a positive impact on patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Despite promising findings, integrating peer support into SUD treatment remains limited, particularly during the critical transition period between emergency department (ED) discharge and treatment initiation. This study examines the effectiveness of Kentucky-certified Peer Support Specialists (PSS) during that period within a Medicaid population. We conducted a retrospective analysis of beneficiaries with SUD who initiated treatment following an ED visit using Kentucky Medicaid claims data from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We assessed prior health conditions using 12-month lookback period (July 2021-June 2022). We then compared monthly engagement outcomes between beneficiaries who received PSS and those who did not. PSS was consistently associated with higher odds of treatment engagement across six months. In unadjusted logistic regression models, odds ratios (ORs) for the PSS group ranged from 1.75 (95 % CI: 1.45-2.09) to 4.17 (95 % CI: 3.53-4.91). Adjusted models accounting for age, sex, geographic location, and health conditions yielded ORs between 1.63 (95 % CI: 1.35-1.95) and 3.84 (95 % CI: 3.23-4.55). Subgroup analysis by sex showed that females receiving PSS had ORs ranging from 1.50 (95 % CI: 1.10-2.05) to 3.77 (95 % CI: 2.80-5.07), while males showed ORs from 1.70 (95 % CI: 1.43-2.14) to 4.22 (95 % CI: 3.43-5.22). Among those with one health condition, PSS effects ranged from Month 1 (OR = 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.95) to a peak in Month 2 (OR = 4.51, 95 % CI: 3.32-6.13). For those with two conditions, effects increased from Month 1 (OR = 1.76, 95 % CI: 1.33-2.34) to a peak in Month 3 (OR = 4.21, 95 % CI: 3.25-5.45).

40581187,"Impact of telehealth, in-person, and hybrid care modalities on buprenorphine discontinuation among patients with opioid use disorder: A retrospective cohort study on commercially insured individuals.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for OUD, but its benefits rely on sustained treatment retention. The expansion of telehealth and hybrid care models, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides an opportunity to improve retention. However, the comparative effectiveness of these care modalities on buprenorphine discontinuation across different treatment phases remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study utilized IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims data from September 2019 to December 2022. The study included insured individuals aged ≥18 years diagnosed with OUD who initiated buprenorphine treatment between March 23, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Patients were stratified into telehealth, in-person, and hybrid care (initiating treatment via telehealth and receiving 51-75 % of visits in-person) groups. The primary outcome was buprenorphine discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days in prescription fills/refills during the 12-month follow-up. Discontinuation was assessed as two separate binary outcomes: (1) early-phase discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days within the first 3 months of treatment, and (2) late-phase discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days between months 4 and 12 among those who remained on treatment through the initial 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were applied for each outcome, and propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to minimize confounding. Among 10,783 patients (mean age 43.25 ± 12.62 years; 49.52 % female), those treated via telehealth were significantly less likely to discontinue buprenorphine during the early treatment phase compared to patients in both in-person and hybrid care groups (OR: 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.75-0.92). During the late treatment phase, patients receiving hybrid care had significantly lower odds of discontinuation compared to those receiving either telehealth or in-person care (OR: 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.62-0.86). These findings were consistent in both unmatched and matched analyses. Telehealth was associated with improved early retention in buprenorphine treatment, while hybrid care models were more effective for long-term retention. The findings suggest that a phased approach, where telehealth is leveraged for treatment initiation and early retention, and when the patient continues via a hybrid model for long-term care, may optimize buprenorphine treatment outcomes.",Journal of substance use and addiction treatment,2025-06-26,10.1016/j.josat.2025.209749,Jabed Al Faysal,Md Mahmudul Hasan,"Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; D'Amore-McKim School of Business, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

40581230,"Diagnosed Mental Health Disorders are Associated With Higher Rates of Postoperative Complications, Additional Procedures, and Lower ACL Tears and Revision Rates Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.","This study aims to analyze the influence of diagnosed mental disorders on postoperative outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Using the TriNetX health network database, we evaluated postoperative complications and additional procedures of patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction over a 20-year period. Patients with a documented mental health disorder (e.g., anxiety or depression) within 1 year preceding surgery were compared to patients without mental health disorders. The cohorts were propensity-matched for demographic and medical factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated within 90 days and 3 years postoperative, respectively. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare outcomes between the 2 cohorts. A total of 8,351 patients with diagnosed mental health disorders were propensity-score matched at a 1:1 ratio with 82,127 patients without diagnosed mental health disorders. Within 90 days postoperative, patients with diagnosed mental health disorders demonstrated significantly higher odds of postoperative infection (P = 0.0042), lower limb mononeuropathy (P = 0.025), acute postoperative pain (P < 0.0001), knee stiffness (P < 0.0001), and any emergency department visit (P < 0.0001). Within 3 years postoperative, these patients had significantly higher odds of opioid abuse (P = 0.0015), knee pain (P < 0.0001), patella fracture (P = 0.0008), and arthrocentesis/aspiration/injection (P = 0.0005), but significantly lower odds of ACL tear (P < 0.0001) and repeat ACL reconstruction (P = 0.0033). Diagnosed mental health disorders were associated with increased short- and long-term postoperative complications following ACL reconstruction, but also demonstrated a potentially protective association with multiple postoperative outcomes, including decreased odds of additional ACL tears and reconstructions.

40583827,Post-Thyroidectomy Opioid Prescription and Risk of Persistent Opioid Use: A Propensity Matched Cohort Study.,"This study evaluates the risk of persistent opioid use (POU) among thyroidectomy patients given postoperative opioids. Patients undergoing thyroidectomy were identified using the TriNetX Research Platform (2010-2024). Cohorts were divided based on opioid prescriptions on the day of surgery. With propensity score matching to prevent confounding bias, risk ratios were calculated for opioid prescriptions 3-9 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included ED presentation, pain diagnosis, and lifetime risk of opioid use disorder, defined as significant social dysfunction due to uncontrolled use. The post-match opioid group (n = 19,727) experienced a 4.61% risk of POU (control: 4.07%), representing a 14% higher risk of POU compared to the non-opioid group (RR 1.14, 95% CI: [1.03, 1.25]). Opioids slightly decreased the likelihood of outpatient visits at 30 days (RR: 0.97 [0.95, 0.98]) and 90 days (RR: 0.96 [0.94, 0.97]) following surgery. There were no significant differences in ED presentation, pain diagnoses at 30 and 90 days, or lifetime OUD risk. Post-thyroidectomy opioid prescription modestly increases POU risk, highlighting the need for careful patient counseling and judicious use.",Head & neck,2025-06-30,10.1002/hed.28232,Oluwatobiloba Ayo-Ajibola,Daniel I Kwon,"Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Caruso Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Caruso Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.",N/A,"endocrine surgical procedures, opioids, opioid‐related disorders, postoperative pain, thyroidectomy"

Characteristics of patients were described, and determinants of choice for medium-dose ICS/LABA+LAMA or high dose ICS/LABA were investigated. 492 639 adults with asthma and ≥1 year of database history were identified and 25 558 were eligible for analysis. 6126 patients stepped-up to medium-dose ICS/LABA+LAMA and 18 947 patients stepped-up to high-dose ICS/LABA. Determinants for step-up to medium-dose ICS/LABA+LAMA were higher age and presence of COPD whereas history of atopy lowered this choice. Other covariates were differentially associated with specific treatment step-up depending on the databases. In uncontrolled asthma patients on medium-dose ICS/LABA, treatment step-up with add-on LAMA was more likely than step-up to high-dose ICS/LABA in older patients, current smokers, with a history of asthma exacerbations and concomitant diagnosis of COPD.",ERJ open research,2025-05-01,10.1183/23120541.00869-2024,Daniel Jeannetot,Katia Verhamme,"Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; SIMG - Italian College of General Practitioners and Primary Care, Florence, Italy.; SIMG - Italian College of General Practitioners and Primary Care, Florence, Italy.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Global Medical Affairs, Chiesi Farmaceutici, S.p.A, Parma, Italy.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.",N/A,N/A

This retrospective study evaluated the incidence, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of psoriasis patients with active TB who had received topical or systemic treatments. Medical records from 13 066 psoriasis patients who presented at Siriraj Hospital over 18 years were reviewed. Among these, 86 (0.66%) developed active TB, yielding an incidence range of 135-1332 per 100 000 psoriasis patients. The mean patient age was 50.4 ± 15.7 years; 63 were men and 23 were women. Pulmonary TB occurred in 55 patients (64.0%), whereas 31 (36.0%) developed extrapulmonary TB. Male sex and smoking were associated with pulmonary TB. The most common pulmonary symptoms were chronic cough (65.5%) and dyspnoea (60.0%), although 7.3% were asymptomatic. Time to TB onset was shorter for extrapulmonary cases (5.7 ± 5.1 years) than for pulmonary cases (7.4 ± 6.5 years), but this difference was not statistically significant. Extrapulmonary disease most frequently involved the lymph node and pleura (25.8%) or the gastrointestinal tract (16.1%). Notably, all four patients who received infliximab within 1 year before TB diagnosis developed extrapulmonary TB. In conclusion, the incidence of TB in psoriasis patients in endemic regions may be high. Geographic factors, sex, smoking, and treatment history appear to influence TB risk.

40599969,Expansion of Telehealth Availability for Mental Health Care After State-Level Policy Changes From 2019 to 2022.,"Although telehealth services expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the association between state policies and telehealth availability has been insufficiently characterized. To investigate the associations between 4 state policies and telehealth availability at outpatient mental health treatment facilities throughout the US. This cohort study measured whether mental health treatment facilities offered telehealth services each quarter from April 2019 through September 2022. The sample comprised facilities with outpatient services that were not part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs system. Four state policies were identified from 4 different sources. Data were analyzed in January 2023. For each quarter, implementation of the following policies was indexed by state: (1) payment parity for telehealth services among private insurers; (2) authorization of audio-only telehealth services for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries; (3) participation in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC), permitting psychiatrists to provide telehealth services across state lines; and (4) participation in the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), permitting clinical psychologists to provide telehealth services across state lines. The primary outcome was the probability of a mental health treatment facility offering telehealth services in each quarter for each study year (2019-2022). Information on the facilities was obtained from the Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Tracking Repository based on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Service Locator. Separate multivariable fixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the difference in the probability of offering telehealth services after vs before policy implementation, adjusting for characteristics of the facility and county in which the facility was located. A total of 12 828 mental health treatment facilities were included. Overall, 88.1% of facilities offered telehealth services in September 2022 compared with 39.4% of facilities in April 2019. All 4 policies were associated with increased odds of telehealth availability: payment parity for telehealth services (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19), reimbursement for audio-only telehealth services (AOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.64-1.81), IMLC participation (AOR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.24-1.59), and PSYPACT participation (AOR, 1.21, 95% CI, 1.12-1.31). Facilities that accepted Medicaid as a form of payment had lower odds of offering telehealth services (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.86) over the study period, as did facilities in counties with a higher proportion (>20%) of Black residents (AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50-0.68). Facilities in rural counties had higher odds of offering telehealth services (AOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.48-1.88). Results of this study suggest that 4 state policies that were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with marked expansion of telehealth availability for mental health care at mental health treatment facilities throughout the US. Despite these policies, telehealth services were less likely to be offered in counties with a greater proportion of Black residents and in facilities that accepted Medicaid and CHIP.Appeared originally in",Focus (American Psychiatric Publishing),2025-07-01,10.1176/appi.focus.25023019,Ryan K McBain,Jonathan H Cantor,"Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).",N/A,N/A
40604652,"Trends in cocaine use and cocaine-related harms in Ireland: a retrospective, multi-source database study.","Increased cocaine supply has coincided with increased global cocaine use. In 2019 Ireland had one of the highest last-year rates of cocaine use in Europe. However, there is a lack of data on the health-related impacts of cocaine use in European countries over time. This retrospective, multi-source database study utilised data from national databases to evaluate the following time trends: (1) prevalence of cocaine use; (2) number of cocaine-related hospital discharges; (3) number of cocaine-related psychiatric hospital admissions; (4) treatment demand for problem cocaine use; and (5) cocaine-related deaths. Joinpoint regression was used to examine change points over time and average annual percentage changes (AAPCs). Last-year cocaine use among 15-64-year-olds increased from 1·1% in 2002/03 to 2·4% in 2022/23. The number of cocaine-related acute hospital discharges per 100,000 population increased from 1·4 in 2000 to 24·3 in 2023 (AAPC: 13·0%; 95% CI: 11·95, 14·84), and psychiatric hospitalisations increased from 0·2 in 2000 to 2·4 in 2022 (AAPC: 11·1%; 95% CI: 9·41, 15·48). Treatment entrants reporting cocaine as a main problem drug increased from 1·5 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 93·2 in 2023 (AAPC: 17·6%; 95% CI: 15·89, 20·74), while cocaine-related deaths increased from 0·3 in 2000 to 5·6 in 2020 (AAPC: 16·9%; 95% CI: 14·71, 21·70). In general, rates of harm increased from 2000 to 2007, decreased until 2011-2013, and since 2013 have increased significantly and consistently.

40604906,Association between neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio and prevalence and mortality of diabetes: a cross-sectional study.,"Inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism play critical roles in diabetes development. This study explored the association between the neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) and diabetes prevalence and mortality. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. The correlation between NHR and the prevalence of diabetes was evaluated using logistic regression models. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to investigate whether NHR related to the risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular diseases. A series of sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. Among the 52,428 study participants, 8,114 (15.48%) had diabetes, with a mean neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) of 3.49. In the full-adjusted model, each unit increase in NHR was related to a 17.0% higher risk of diabetes (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI 1.13-1.21], P < 0.001). Results were similar when participants were categorized by NHR tertiles (odds ratio, 2.08 [95% CI 1.76-2.47], comparing extreme quartiles). The stratified analyses showed that the association between NHR and risk of diabetes was more obvious in female, White, former smokers and participants with age ≥ 50 years. After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9.42 (5.08-14.33) years, higher NHR levels were positively associated with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in diabetes patients. A series of sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. Elevated NHR is linked to higher diabetes prevalence and increased mortality risk in a U.S. population, independent of traditional risk factors. Regular monitoring of NHR may serve as an easy-to-measure tool for risk stratification for diabetes and its adverse outcomes.

40610254,Multimorbidity Profiles and Cause-Specific Mortality Among Older Adults with Schizophrenia.,"To characterize multimorbidity patterns among mid- to late-life adults with schizophrenia and evaluate the relationship between multimorbidity patterns and cause-specific mortality. This study utilized a national, longitudinal, cohort of U.S. veterans aged 50 years and older with schizophrenia who were followed 2012-2020 (n = 91,680). Latent class analysis was used to identify multimorbidity profiles of medical and neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Demographic variables and diagnoses were extracted from the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Patient Care Database and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data. Information on cause-specific mortality was drawn from the VA Mortality Data Repository. Fine-Gray models were used to examine associations between multimorbidity classes and incident mortality over the study period, including death due to natural causes, unintentional injury, and suicide. Four multimorbidity classes were identified: Minimal Multimorbidity (52%), high anxiety/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (19%), psychiatric and substance use disorder (SUD) (19%), and high Medical-Psychiatric (11%). The high Medical-Psychiatric class had the highest risk of overall mortality during the study period (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.97-2.09 versus Minimal Multimorbidity), with the most common causes of death due to heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The psychiatry and SUD class had the highest risk of death due to unintentional injury (HR 2.24, 95% CI 2.00-2.51). The High Anxiety/PTSD group had the highest risk of suicide death (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.77).

40610285,Association of peripheral nerve blocks with increased postoperative pain and opioid use in orthopaedic surgery: a single-centre retrospective cohort study.,"Peripheral nerve blocks have become popular in orthopaedic surgeries to improve acute postoperative pain. However, studies are mixed on their effectiveness in decreasing postoperative opioid consumption. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to understand if peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative opioid exposure and risk for opioid dependence. This retrospective cohort study evaluated electronic health record data for adults undergoing orthopaedic surgery with general anaesthesia from 2016 to 2020 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Linear models were fitted on propensity-weighted data to characterise the association between single injection peripheral nerve blocks and clinical outcomes. Our primary outcomes were maximum pain score and cumulative opioid dose, quantified in morphine milligram equivalents, administered in the PACU. Post-discharge outcomes associated with pain and opioid consumption were also evaluated. Among 22 956 patients, peripheral nerve block administration was associated with lower maximum pain scores and lower probability of opioid administration in the PACU. However, it was associated with higher maximum pain scores and a 22.7% increase in opioid consumption during the hospital stay. Peripheral nerve blocks were associated with an increase in opioid prescriptions at 30 days after discharge, but no increase at 90 or 180 days, and with decreased chronic pain diagnoses 1 yr after operation. Although single injection peripheral nerve blocks were effective in reducing immediate postoperative pain and opioid consumption, they were associated with greater opioid consumption that could increase the risk for opioid dependence.

40611139,Associations of socioeconomic status and health lifestyles with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: two nationwide population-based studies.,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, with smoking and poor diet as major contributing factors. However, the impact of a comprehensive healthy lifestyle as a potential mediator between SES and COPD risk remains understudied. This study analyzed data from 32,836 US adults in the NHANES (1999-2020) and 131,872 UK adults in the UK Biobank. SES was assessed via latent class analysis based on income, education, employment, and health insurance (NHANES). SES was categorized into high, middle, and low levels. Healthy lifestyle scores included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Weighted multivariable logistic regression (NHANES) and Cox proportional hazards models (UK Biobank) were used to assess the associations between SES and the prevalence (NHANES) or incidence (UK Biobank) of COPD. In the UK Biobank, the incidences of newly diagnosed COPD in the high-, medium-, and low-SES groups were 1.27%, 2.92%, and 6.57%, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the prevalence rates of COPD were 2.55%, 2.53%, and 4.50%, respectively. Compared with the highest SES group, a low SES was a risk factor for both the incidence and prevalence of COPD (UK Biobank: HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.98 to 3.58; NHANES: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.10). The percentages of the mediation effect of a healthy lifestyle in the UK Biobank and US NHANES were 2.81% and 37.27%, respectively. Additionally, compared with those in the group with the highest SES and the healthiest lifestyle, the risk of COPD incidence and prevalence increased by 950% (HR = 10.50, 95% CI = 9.04 to 12.20) and 641% (OR = 7.41, 95% CI = 5.10 to 10.78), respectively, in the group with the lowest SES and the unhealthiest lifestyle. Risk factor analysis for COPD revealed that, in addition to a low SES (HR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.39 to 2.72; OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.46) and unhealthy lifestyle (HR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.73 to 3.12; OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.13 to 4.57), smoking (HR = 5.23, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.61; OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 3.23 to 4.59) was the most significant risk factor for COPD. Low SES significantly contributes to COPD risk, but a healthy lifestyle mediating this association. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices and addressing socioeconomic disparities are essential public health strategies for COPD prevention. Additionally, smoking cessation and increased early screening in smokers are strongly recommended.",BMC public health,2025-07-03,10.1186/s12889-025-23568-5,Siying Liu,Yongze Li,"Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism and the Institute of Endocrinology, NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Thyroid Diseases, First Hospital of China Medical University, No. 155, Nanjing Bei Street, Shenyang, 110001, P.

Utilizing cross-sectional data from 18,500 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005-2018 cycle), we developed a composite exposure model integrating BDoH (smoking status, physical activity, dietary quality) and MDoH (obesity metrics, hypertension, diabetes) through standardized questionnaires and clinical measurements. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were calculated from peripheral blood cell counts. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined dose-response relationships, with trend analysis explicitly testing cumulative BDoH-MDoH interactions. The cohort (mean age 44.3 ± 0.3 years; 52.4% male) demonstrated significant positive associations between adverse health determinants and inflammatory indices.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing PRES; however, it is unclear whether this risk is primarily driven by comorbid conditions or if renal dysfunction itself is an independent risk factor. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, outcomes, and resource utilization of PRES across CKD stages compared with patients without kidney disease. A retrospective study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database. Adult patients nonelectively admitted with PRES from 2016 to 2019. Different stages of CKD versus no kidney disease. All-cause in-hospital mortality, Incidence of PRES hospitalizations, in-hospital morbidity (intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, brain herniation, and status epilepticus), and health care resource utilization (length of hospital stay and total hospitalization charges). Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted using survey design methods. The cohort included 12,605 patients, representing 0.014% of all admissions. PRES incidence increased from 0.013% in 2016 to 0.015% in 2019 ( The use of administrative data limits access to detailed clinical information. Residual confounding factors remain possible. This is the largest study to date on PRES in CKD populations.

40618656,Risk of drug-related mortality among people receiving opioid-agonist treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in delivery of opioid-agonist treatment (OAT) and risk of drug-related harm in Scotland. This study aimed to (i) examine changes in drug-related death (DRD) rates and the protective effect of OAT during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland (2020-2022) compared with the previous decade (2011-2019); and (ii) describe trends in OAT prescribing over the same period. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Scottish national Prescribing Information System linked to healthcare and administrative data from Public Health Scotland. The cohort included individuals prescribed OAT (methadone or buprenorphine). We examined trends in OAT prescribing, calculated crude DRD rates per 1000 person-years, and used multivariable quasi-Poisson regression to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) for DRD risk across four time periods (2011-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2019, and 2020-2022). Between 2011 and 2022, 49,000 individuals accessed OAT, contributing 366,344 person years of follow-up, during which 5255 DRDs occurred. In the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-2022), 34,241 people received OAT and there were 1825 DRDs. DRD rates increased steadily prior to 2020, but remained stable during the pandemic: the observed DRD rate during 2020-2022 was comparable to 2017-2019 (aIRR=0.96, 95 % CI=0.80, 1.15). Across all periods, being on OAT was consistently associated with a lower risk of DRD compared to being off treatment (aIRR=3.47, 95 % CI=2.98, 4.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, DRD rates remained stable following a three-fold rise since 2011-13. The protective effect of OAT was sustained during the pandemic, which highlights the importance of maintaining access to OAT during public health crises.",The International journal on drug policy,2025-07-05,10.1016/j.drugpo.2025.104912,Megan Glancy,Sharon Hutchinson,"School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK; Public Health Scotland, Glasgow, UK.

One in six patients with IBD is estimated to have a concomitant SUD. SUD has had mounting morbidity and mortality rates since 2010 and has been shown to adversely affect IBD activity. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized at least once with IBD from 2010 through 2020 using the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis evaluated associations between SUD and age, sex, insurance type, income for the ZIP Code, and geographic region. Of 2,532,450 patients hospitalized with IBD, 26.5% and 17.0% involved SUD in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. Between 2010 and 2020, the prevalence of patients with SUD increased from 23.8% to 27.9% in CD (Ptrend<0.001) and 14.2% to 19.4% in UC (Ptrend<0.001). Rates of alcohol, opioid, and cannabis use disorders increased (Ptrend<0.001 for all). Patients with SUD were more likely to be male [CD: OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.24-1.27; UC: 1.34, (1.31-1.36)], have Medicaid insurance compared with Medicare [CD: 1.59, (1.55-1.63); UC: 1.84, (1.78-1.90)], and be in a lower income quartile [lowest to highest quartile, CD: 1.54, (1.51-1.58); UC: 1.56, (1.52-1.61)]. SUD among IBD patients continued to increase over time, with the predominant substances used shifting from alcohol to opioids and cannabis.

40623259,Administrative Claims Data Show Increased Morbidity Risk For US Adults In Same-Sex Versus Different-Sex Relationships.,"Studies have found that sexual minority populations more often report worse overall health, lower health-related quality of life, and greater risk for disability than their heterosexual counterparts. This study used a novel approach to identify people in same-sex relationships, using insurance administrative claims data, and compared the prevalence of morbidity in that population with its prevalence in the population of those in different-sex relationships. This observational retrospective cohort study used the Merative MarketScan Research Database, which pooled data from private insurers from the period 2016-22. We identified 340,728 people in same-sex relationships, making this one of the largest studies on sexual minority populations to date, and found that they had higher Elixhauser morbidity scores than their counterparts in different-sex relationships. Sexual minorities experienced a greater prevalence of mental health morbidities (that is, depression, psychoses, and alcohol and drug use disorders) than their peers in different-sex relationships, with adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) ranging from 1.23 to 2.07. Sexual minority men also were more likely to have HIV (PRR: 93.62) and lymphoma (PRR: 1.34) than their male counterparts in different-sex relationships. These findings support the survey literature that has documented that sexual minority populations experience greater mental health and HIV-related morbidity, and they offer a novel approach to identifying members of sexual minorities.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2025-07-01,10.1377/hlthaff.2024.01014,Landon Hughes,Brittany M Charlton,"Landon Hughes (LHughes@hsph.harvard.edu), Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Gilbert Gonzales, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Sarah McKetta, Harvard University.; Alex McDowell, Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brittany M.

Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT). England and Wales. ASSIST trial participants comprised 8756 students aged 12-13 years in 59 schools assigned using stratified block randomization to the control (29 schools, 4193 students) or intervention (30 schools, 4563 students) condition. The target population was represented by 12-13-year-old participants in the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People in England Survey (SDDU) in 2004 (n = 3958), 2006 (n = 3377), 2014 (n = 3145), 2016 (n = 4874) and 2021 (n = 3587), which are randomly sampled school-based surveys with student response rates varying between 85% and 93%. The ASSIST intervention involved 2 days of off-site training of influential students to encourage their peers not to smoke over a 10-week period. The control group continued with their usual education. The outcome was the proportion of students who self-reported weekly smoking 2 years post-intervention. The prevalence of weekly smoking at the 2-year follow-up in the ASSIST trial in 2004 was 4.1%, 49.5% of students were girls, and 7.8% ethnic minorities. In the SDDU in 2004, the prevalence of weekly smoking was 3.6%, 47.6% students were girls and 14.4% ethnic minorities and in 2021 0.2% were weekly smokers, 48.6% girls and 27.8% ethnic minorities. The odds ratio of weekly smoking in the ASSIST trial in 2004 was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.71-1.02]. The estimated odds ratio in the SDDU target population in 2004 was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.72-1.13), in 2014 was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.70-1.14), and by 2021 was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.60-1.28). The confidence interval ratio was used to estimate precision in the transported estimates in the target population and was 1.57 in 2004, 1.63 in 2014 and 2.13 in 2021, reflecting increasing uncertainty in the effect of ASSIST over time. Subgroup analyses showed effects were comparable when restricted to only English schools in the ASSIST trial. These exploratory analyses indicate the effect of the ASSIST school-based smoking prevention intervention reported in the original trial may not have been replicated in the target population over the 17-year period of its licensing and roll out.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2025-07-07,10.1111/add.70141,James White,James White,"Centre for Trials Research, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.",N/A,"generalizability, prevention, randomized controlled trial, real world evidence, smoking, transportability"

This study aimed to determine if similar relationships exist in meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT). To compare clinical outcomes and failure rates for patients who underwent MAT based on presence or absence of self-reported drug allergies. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A retrospective review of patients who underwent MAT from January 2004 to December 2021 at a single academic medical institution was conducted with minimum follow-up of 2 years. Age, sex, body mass index, and presence of concomitant procedures were collected. The presence or absence of patient-reported allergies was recorded from the electronic medical record. Graft failure was defined as removal or revision of primary MAT, subsequent cartilage procedure, or progression to arthroplasty. The Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and all Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were compared for each patient from preoperative to 2-year time points. The minimal clinically important difference was determined using distribution-based method. A total of 107 patients who underwent MAT with minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in the study. Of the total, 22 (20.6%) had self-reported ≥1 medication allergy and 85 (79.4%) did not report any medication allergies. There were no significant differences between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts in other demographic variables. There was no significant difference in failure rate between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts (18.1% vs 8.2%;  The presence of self-reported drug allergies does not appear to adversely affect clinically significant outcome improvement or graft survival rates in patients undergoing MAT.

40629632,The association between red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio and chest pain prevalence in US adults: A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-2018.,"The red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio (RAR), a novel marker reflecting both inflammation and nutritional status, has emerged as a potential clinical biomarker. However, its link to chest pain in general populations remains underexplored. This study is the first to assess the association between RAR and chest pain prevalence using data from the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort. Data from 21,174 adults in the 2005-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Chest pain was assessed via the Rose Angina Questionnaire. RAR was calculated by dividing red cell distribution width by serum albumin. Multivariable logistic regression models incorporating survey weights, restricted cubic spline analyses, and subgroup analyses were used to evaluate the association, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. A nonlinear relationship was found between RAR and chest pain, with an inflection point at RAR = 3.59. Below this point, each unit increase in RAR was associated with a 32% higher likelihood of chest pain (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.49, P < .0001). Above 3.59, the association weakened. Compared to the lowest quartile (Q1), individuals in the highest RAR quartile (Q4) had a 26% increased prevalence of chest pain (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.15-1.39, P < .0001). Subgroup analysis showed stronger associations in smokers (interaction P = .016), with consistent results across age and racial/ethnic groups.
