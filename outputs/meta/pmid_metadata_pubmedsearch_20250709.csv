40201330,The impact of increased telehealth use on the treatment of substance use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift from in-person substance use disorder (SUD) treatment to virtual telehealth (TH) visits, creating opportunities to assess the impact of virtual visits on SUD treatment. This study utilized retrospective, de-identified, electronic health record (EHR) data from Oracle EHR Real-World Data to examine the impact of TH on SUD treatment. Patients with a qualifying SUD diagnosis from 141 U.S. health systems were included and divided into pre-TH (January 1, 2017 through January 1, 2019) and COVID (January 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022) cohorts. This study analyzed TH utilization, medications for SUD (MSUD) prescribing, drug-related events, and mental health crises, comparing patient outcomes where the treating clinician was a high TH user versus a low TH user in both pre-COVID and COVID periods. Patients visiting high TH clinicians had lower MSUD prescribing rates, yet a higher MSUD day's supply, and higher rates of TH outpatient visits than those visiting low TH providers, with both groups having an increase in TH visits during the COVID period. Patients with high TH clinicians had lower rates of SUD-related hospitalizations than those with low TH providers but similar rates of drug overdoses, relapses, injection-related infections, and mental health crises. TH modalities showed increased SUD-related outpatient visits without increasing adverse outcomes, indicating its potential as a sustainable alternative to in-person care. This study highlights the need for further research on TH efficacy for SUD-specific populations and supports the continued integration of telehealth in SUD treatment post-pandemic.",SSM - population health,2025-06-01,10.1016/j.ssmph.2025.101780,Fares Qeadan,Talar Markossian,"Loyola University Chicago, Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Maywood, IL, USA.; Loyola University Chicago, Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Maywood, IL, USA.; Loyola University Chicago, Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Maywood, IL, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, MI, USA.; Loyola University Chicago, Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, Maywood, IL, USA.",N/A,"COVID-19 pandemic, Drug overdose deaths, Drug-related mortality, Pharmacotherapy, Substance use disorders (SUDs), Telehealth"
40202749,Automating the Addiction Behaviors Checklist for Problematic Opioid Use Identification.,"Individuals whose chronic pain is managed with opioids are at high risk of developing an opioid use disorder. Electronic health records (EHR) allow large-scale studies to identify a continuum of problematic opioid use, including opioid use disorder. Traditionally, this is done through diagnostic codes, which are often unreliable and underused. To determine whether regular expressions, an interpretable natural language processing technique, could automate a validated clinical tool (Addiction Behaviors Checklist) to identify problematic opioid use. This cross-sectional study reports on a retrospective cohort with data analyzed from 2021 through 2023. The approach was evaluated against a blinded, manually reviewed holdout test set and validated against an independent test set at a separate institution. The study used data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Synthetic Derivative, a deidentified version of the EHR for research purposes. This cohort comprised 8063 individuals with chronic pain, defined by diagnostic codes on at least 2 days. The study team collected free-text notes, demographics, and diagnostic codes and performed an external validation with 100 individuals with chronic pain from Geisinger, recruited from an interventional pain clinic cohort. The primary outcome was the evaluation of the automated method in identifying patients demonstrating problematic opioid use and its comparison with manual medical record review and opioid use disorder diagnostic codes. Methods with F1 scores were evaluated (a single value that combines sensitivity and positive predictive value at a single threshold) and areas under the curve (a single value that combines sensitivity and specificity across multiple thresholds). Among the 8063 patients in the primary site (5081 female [63%] and 2982 male [37%]; mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years) and 100 patients in the validation site (57 female [57%] and 43 male [43%]; mean [SD] age, 54 [13] years), the automated approach outperformed diagnostic codes based on F1 scores (0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83 vs 0.08; 95% CI, 0.00-0.19 at the primary site and 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.85 vs 0.29; 95% CI, 0.07-0.50 at the validation site) and areas under the curve (0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89 vs 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50-0.55 at the primary site and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94 vs 0.59;95% CI, 0.50-0.67 at validation site). This automated data extraction technique may facilitate earlier identification of people at risk for and who are experiencing problematic opioid use, and create new opportunities for studying long-term sequelae of opioid pain management.",JAMA psychiatry,2025-06-01,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0424,Angus H Chatham,Alvin D Jeffery,"Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Research Institute, Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, Pennsylvania.; Research Institute, Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, Pennsylvania.; Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Anesthesiology, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.","Humans, Opioid-Related Disorders, Male, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Middle Aged, Chronic Pain, Retrospective Studies, Checklist, Electronic Health Records, Adult, Natural Language Processing, Behavior, Addictive, Analgesics, Opioid, Aged",N/A
40204368,"Implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) utilizing the CRAFFT+N among pediatric patients at an outpatient psychiatric practice.","Substance use among adolescents poses a significant public health challenge, with escalating rates over recent decades contributing to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, only a fraction of affected individuals receive intervention, emphasizing the need for comprehensive healthcare strategies. The CRAFFT is a common tool used to evaluate substance use in youths, but limited studies have examined the innovative CRAFFT+N, which includes a nicotine screen. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and fidelity of pediatric SBIRT in an outpatient psychiatric setting through retrospective chart review, and secondary aims were to explore rates of pediatric substance use and associations with psychiatric variables and modality of visits, in addition to trends over time. A retrospective chart review of electronic health record data was completed. Chi-squared analyses were used to compare which psychiatric diagnoses and psychotropic medications were associated with positive CRAFFT+N scores. A total of 455 patient encounters were reviewed, revealing concerning rates of substance and nicotine use, with approximately 20 % screening positive on the CRAFFT+N. Depressive disorders (p < 0.001), OCD (p = 0.012), and neurodevelopmental disorders (p = 0.015) were associated with positive CRAFFT scores. Positive nicotine scores were associated with bipolar disorders (p < 0.001), psychotic disorders (p = 0.001), and other psychiatric disorders (p = 0.039). Mood stabilizers were the only medication class associated with positive CRAFFT+N scores (both p < 0.001). The new CRAFFT+N tool can be used to implement SBIRT into the workflow in an outpatient setting interested in assessing substance use in those aged 12-21 years.",Archives of psychiatric nursing,2025-04-01,10.1016/j.apnu.2025.151863,Shawna Witt,Jamie Zelazny,"University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, Department of Health and Community Systems, 3500 Victoria St., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States of America.; University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, Department of Health and Community Systems, 3500 Victoria St., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States of America.

40204884,Tobacco smoking and the risk of aortic dissection in the UK Biobank and a meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"Tobacco smoking is thought to increase risk of aortic dissection, however, few prospective studies have been published on the association to date and little is known about the effect of smoking cessation on risk of aortic dissection. To clarify these associations we investigated the association between different aspects of tobacco smoking and aortic dissection in the UK Biobank Study and we summarized the available data in a meta-analysis of cohort studies. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between smoking and risk of aortic dissection in the UK Biobank. PubMed and Embase were searched up to 19th of July 2024 to identify relevant cohort studies and random effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs in the meta-analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years a total of 376 incident cases of aortic dissection were identified among 499,078 participants. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for current and former smokers versus never smokers were 2.48 (1.87-3.29) and 1.03 (0.81-1.29), respectively. There was a dose-response between increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day and aortic dissection risk with HRs (95% CIs) of 2.31 (1.13-4.71), 2.94 (1.88-4.58), and 2.63 (1.65-4.37) for 1-9, 10-19, and ≥ 20 cigarettes/day among current smokers. Greater number of pack-years was positively associated with aortic dissection (1.66, 1.21-2.28 for ≥ 30 pack-years vs. never smokers). Former smokers who had quit for varying durations had a 48-75% reduction in aortic dissection risk when compared to current smokers. In the meta-analysis, the summary RR was 2.44 (1.65-3.60, I",Scientific reports,2025-04-09,10.1038/s41598-025-96529-y,Momina Yawar I Khan,Dagfinn Aune,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, White City Campus, 90 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, White City Campus, 90 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, White City Campus, 90 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK.; Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart, Vascular, and Thoracic Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, White City Campus, 90 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK. d.aune@imperial.ac.uk.; Department of Nutrition, Oslo New University College, Oslo, Norway. d.aune@imperial.ac.uk.; Department of Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway. d.aune@imperial.ac.uk.","Humans, Aortic Dissection, United Kingdom, Tobacco Smoking, Prospective Studies, Female, Male, Risk Factors, Middle Aged, Biological Specimen Banks, Proportional Hazards Models, Smoking Cessation, Aged, Adult, UK Biobank","Aortic dissection, Cohort, Meta-analysis, Smoking, Tobacco"
40205451,Cross-sectional examination of characteristics of higher-dose buprenorphine prescriptions during the era of illicit fentanyl.,"In response to greater illicit fentanyl use, buprenorphine daily doses exceeding the FDA's recommended target daily dose (16 mg) and maximum suggested daily dose (24 mg) may provide better outcomes, but little is known about higher dosage prescribing patterns. To better understand buprenorphine prescribing patterns, this manuscript examines the frequency and characteristics of dispensed buprenorphine of ≤ 16mg, > 16-24 mg, and > 24 mg daily dose. We used IQVIA data to conduct a cross-sectional study of opioid use disorder-indicated buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies January 2019 - December 2020; categorized prescriptions as ≤ 16mg, > 16 to 24 mg, and > 24 mg daily dose; and examined overall rates and rates by patient, insurer and county characteristics, and prescriber specialty. We categorized buprenorphine prescriptions by patient sex, age cohort, primary payment source, and prescriber specialty and state and conducted univariate and bivariate analyses of buprenorphine daily dose categories overall and among clinicians frequently prescribing buprenorphine at the highest doses, > 24 mg. Approximately 19.5% (n = 5,568,964) of the 28 million buprenorphine prescriptions from 68,898 clinicians were > 16-24 mg; 2% (n = 641,390) were > 24 mg. Approximately 26% (n = 17,939) of clinicians wrote at least one prescription > 24 mg; 2,780 clinicians (4% of buprenorphine prescribers) were responsible for 82.2% (n = 527,597) of dispensed prescriptions > 24 mg. 28% of prescriptions > 24 mg written by these prescribers were cash-pay, 12.5% covered by Medicaid, and 6.7% covered by Medicare. There was no correlation between state fentanyl overdose rate and buprenorphine prescriptions > 24 mg per 1,000,000 residents. In 2019-2020, fewer than 3% of dispensed buprenorphine prescriptions exceeded the FDA suggested maximum of 24 mg daily dose; 80% of the prescriptions for a > 24 mg daily dose were written by 4% of buprenorphine prescribers. As clinicians and policymakers pay greater attention to ensuring individuals are receiving buprenorphine dosages adequate to effectively treat their opioid use disorder, the recently revised FDA recommendations may encourage such behavior. Additionally, disproportionate reliance on cash payment for higher daily doses suggests public and private insurers could facilitate access to such treatment when appropriate.",Addiction science & clinical practice,2025-04-09,10.1186/s13722-025-00547-0,Bradley D Stein,Jessica S Merlin,"RAND, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

40207202,Real-world Rollout of Injectable Antiretrovirals for HIV Prevention and Treatment: Correlates of Early Adoption.,"Data are limited on implementation of long-acting injectable (LAI) HIV treatment (ART) and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We characterized ""early adopters"" of LAI ART and PrEP in terms of social determinants of health using a health equity lens. Our retrospective cohort included patients prescribed ART or PrEP through a large urban health system (January 2021-September 2023) in the Northeastern United States. We used electronic health record data for PrEP and ART to examine group differences between those on LAI or oral medications using analysis of variance, chi-square tests, or Fisher exact tests. Bivariate logistic regression modeled associations between LAI ART or LAI PrEP and social determinants of health. In the PrEP group, 238 patients were prescribed LAI (n = 63) or oral (n = 193) PrEP. Most PrEP patients were men (80.7%), non-Hispanic (79.5%), and White (60.7%) and had public insurance (83.1%). Compared with patients on oral PrEP, those on LAI less often experienced food insecurity, financial strain, depression, anxiety, or substance use disorders. In bivariate models, LAI PrEP inversely correlated with female sex, current smoking, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. In the treatment group, 1194 patients were prescribed LAI (n = 76) or oral (n = 1118) ART, with a median age of 57.0 years; 63.6% were from minoritized groups. Only age was significantly associated with LAI ART (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.961-0.993;  In this large retrospective cohort of patients on LAI PrEP and ART, patients receiving LAI less often experienced social barriers to accessing care.

This study investigates the association of hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and cancer-related mortality in patients with NAFLD cirrhosis. This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, assessing 11 550 adults. NAFLD cirrhosis was defined by a hepatic steatosis index greater than 36 and a NAFLD fibrosis score greater than 0.676 in participants without viral hepatitis or excessive alcohol use. The HALP score was categorized into low (<32), moderate (32-48.3), and high (>48.3). Logistic and weighted Cox regression analyses were conducted, along with subgroup and restricted cubic spline analyses. Higher HALP scores were associated with lower all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions with gender and age, showing a decreased risk of all-cause mortality in males and individuals aged 40 and above with higher HALP scores. A U-shaped relationship between HALP scores and all-cause mortality was observed. The study demonstrates that HALP is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in the NAFLD cirrhosis population, suggesting that HALP may be a useful predictor of mortality risk.",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2025-06-01,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002959,Ruifeng Zhang,Jing Yu,"Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.","Humans, Male, Female, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Middle Aged, Nutrition Surveys, Retrospective Studies, Adult, Liver Cirrhosis, United States, Aged, Risk Factors, Platelet Count, Lymphocyte Count, Biomarkers, Cause of Death, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hemoglobins, Serum Albumin","HALP, NAFLD, NHANES, cirrhosis, cohort study, mortality"
40210205,Sociodemographic Differences in Logins and Engagement With the Electronic Health Coach Messaging Feature of a Mobile App to Support Opioid and Stimulant Use Recovery: Results From a 1-Month Observational Study.,"Mobile health apps can serve as a critical tool in supporting the overall health of uninsured and underinsured individuals and groups who have been historically marginalized by the medical community and may be hesitant to seek health care. However, data on uptake and engagement with specific app features (eg, in-app messaging) are often lacking, limiting our ability to understand nuanced patterns of app use. This study aims to characterize sociodemographic differences in uptake and engagement with a smartphone app (uMAT-R) to support recovery efforts in a sample of individuals with opioid and stimulant use disorders in the Greater St. Louis area. We enrolled individuals into the uMAT-R service program from facilities providing recovery support in the Greater St. Louis area between January 2020 and April 2022. Study participants were recruited from service project enrollees. We describe the number of logins and electronic health coach (eCoach) messages participants sent in the first 30 days following enrollment using medians and IQRs and counts and proportions of those who ever (vs never) logged in and sent their eCoach a message. We compare estimates across sociodemographic subgroups, by insurance status, and for those who did and did not participate in the research component of the project using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Pearson chi-square tests. Of all 695 participants, 446 (64.2%) logged into uMAT-R at least once during the 30 days following enrollment (median 2, IQR 0-8 logins). Approximately half of those who logged in (227/446) used the eCoach messaging feature (median 1, IQR 0-3 messages). Research participants (n=498), who could receive incentives for app engagement, were more likely to log in and use the eCoach messaging feature compared to others (n=197). Younger individuals, those with higher educational attainment, and White, non-Hispanic individuals were more likely to log in at least once compared to their counterparts. The median number of logins was higher among women, and those who were younger, employed, and not on Medicaid compared to their counterparts. Among those who logged in at least once, younger individuals and those with lower educational attainment were more likely to send at least one eCoach message compared to others. Mobile apps are a viable tool for supporting individuals in recovery from opioid and stimulant use disorders. However, older individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower educational attainment may need additional login support, or benefit from alternative mechanisms of recovery support. In addition, apps may need to be tailored to achieve sustained engagement (ie, repeat logins) among men, and individuals who are older, unemployed, or on Medicaid. Older individuals and those with higher educational attainment who may be less likely to use eCoach messaging features could benefit from features tailored to their preferences.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-04-10,10.2196/54753,Lindsey M Filiatreau,Patricia Cavazos-Rehg,"Division of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, United States.","Humans, Female, Male, Mobile Applications, Adult, Middle Aged, Opioid-Related Disorders, Sociodemographic Factors, Substance-Related Disorders, Socioeconomic Factors, Missouri","Pearson chi-square, St. Louis, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, app, digital health intervention, eCoach messaging, engagement, mHealth, mobile app, mobile health, observational study, opioid use disorder, recovery, smartphone, sociodemographic, stimulant use, stimulant use disorder, substance misuse, substance use recovery, uptake"

Because SUDs are highly prevalent in the USA, it is important to establish whether this patient population is less likely to obtain screening. This retrospective cohort study included 220 227 patients, with 209 132 having no SUD and 11 095 (5.0%) with SUD based on electronic health record data in a multi-state, Midwestern healthcare system (1 January 2018-31 December 2022). The outcome was the receipt of a mammogram in the 5-year follow-up period. Patients were women aged 40-69 years as of 1 January 2018, with ≥ 2 in-person primary care visits between 2018 and 2022. Covariates included demographics, health services utilization, and physical/psychiatric conditions. Mean age of the sample was 54.7 (± 8.3) years old.

40221929,Impact of an electronically-integrated clinical pathway on hospital initiation of medications for alcohol use disorder and subsequent hospital utilization.,"Medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) are underutilized and multiple barriers and disparities in treatment initiation have been identified. Effective hospital-based strategies to promote MAUD use are not well-defined. To determine whether an electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical pathway increases MAUD initiation. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study with consecutive adult inpatients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and withdrawal requiring treatment who were admitted to a health system comprising a mix of community and tertiary academic medical centers. The impact of voluntary use of an AUD EHR-integrated clinical pathway on MAUD initiation (main outcome) and ED return or readmission for any cause within 30 days of discharge (secondary outcomes) was evaluated. Among 2630 inpatient medicine encounters, the pathway was utilized in 17.8%. Pathway utilization was associated with 4.31 (confidence interval [CI]: 3.10-5.99, p < .001) increased odds of MAUD initiation as compared with encounters without pathway utilization (31% vs. 15.4%).

40227745,Risk of Dementia in Individuals With Emergency Department Visits or Hospitalizations Due to Cannabis.,"Cannabis use is associated with short-term memory impairment and long-term changes in brain structure; however, little is known about whether disordered cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of a dementia diagnosis. To investigate the association between emergency department visits or hospitalizations (acute care encounters) due to cannabis and future dementia diagnosis. Population-based, retrospective, matched cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2021 (with follow-up until 2022) including all individuals aged 45 to 105 years living in Ontario who were eligible and did not have a diagnosis of dementia at cohort entry (2 620 083 individuals excluded). Individuals with incident acute care due to cannabis use, defined using International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision coding. We used cause-specific adjusted hazard models to compare new diagnoses of dementia (from a validated algorithm) between individuals with acute care due to cannabis use with (1) individuals with all-cause acute care (excluding cannabis), (2) the general population, and (3) individuals with acute care due to alcohol use. The study included 6 086 794 individuals, of whom 16 275 (0.3%) had incident acute care due to cannabis use (mean age, 55.2 [SD, 8.3] years; 60.3% male). Annual rates of incident acute care due to cannabis use increased 5.0-fold in individuals aged 45 to 64 years (from 10.16 to 50.65 per 100 000) and 26.7-fold in individuals aged 65 years or older (from 0.65 to 16.99 per 100 000) between 2008 and 2021. Individuals with incident acute care due to cannabis use were at a 1.5-fold and 3.9-fold increased risk of dementia diagnosis within 5 years relative to individuals with all-cause acute care and the general population of the same age and sex, respectively (absolute rates of dementia diagnosis: 5.0% for cannabis-related acute care, 3.6% for all-cause acute care, and 1.3% in the general population). After adjustment for sociodemographics and chronic health conditions, individuals with acute care due to cannabis use remained at elevated risk relative to those with all-cause acute care (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.39) and the general population (aHR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.38-2.15). Individuals with acute care due to cannabis use were at lower risk than those with acute care due to alcohol use (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.76). Individuals with cannabis use severe enough to require hospital-based care were at increased risk of a new dementia diagnosis compared with those with all-cause hospital-based care or the general population.

40234359,Prostate Cancer Screening Among Traditionally Underserved Populations at a Large Public Safety-Net Institution.,"Existing literature underscores racial and sociodemographic disparities in prostate cancer screening (PCS) in the USA. To evaluate whether traditional PCS disparities are evident within a health safety-net institution tailored to support traditionally underserved populations. A retrospective cohort study using electronic health-record data was conducted at an urban safety-net institution. Male patients aged 51-70 years with a primary care provider (PCP) visit from 2018 to 2019 were included. The primary outcome was PCS, defined as receiving a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test within the study period. Investigated patient characteristics included self-reported race and ethnicity, language, insurance, marital status, median household income, serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD), and family history of prostate cancer (PCa). Bivariate analyses using chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to compare PCS rates between the groups. The cohort included 10,059 men, of which 40.4% had PCS. In total, 57.3% of the study population was of non-White race and 61.4% of non-North American/European ethnicity. A total of 31.2% had limited English proficiency (LEP), 17.8% had SMI, and 13.2% had SUD. In multivariable analysis of race, Black patients (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.71-2.24, p < 0.001) and Hispanic patients (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.3-1.76, p < 0.001) had significantly higher odds of PCS than White patients.

40236760,Risk and Protective Factors of COPD Among Smokers: A Cross-Sectional Study Using NHANES Database.,"Smoking plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), underscoring the importance of smoking cessation. Nevertheless, not all smokers who do not quit will necessarily develop COPD. This study aimed to examine the risk and protective factors associated with COPD among individuals who smoke. The study included a cohort of 2619 adult smokers with lung function data, whose demographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary patterns were examined using T-tests, Chi-square tests, and logical analysis. Among the study participants, 441 individuals were identified as having COPD by analyzing pulmonary function data. Advanced age (p<0.001), low body mass index (BMI, p<0.001), ethnicity (p=0.019), and comorbid asthma (p<0.001) were found to be statistically correlated with the presence of COPD. Additionally, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables (p=0.026) was shown to have a beneficial impact. After considering factors related to type 2 inflammation, nutrient intake from vegetables and fruits, and other variables, it was observed that vitamin C (p<0.001) exhibited a protective effect against COPD in smokers. Additionally, advanced age (p<0.001), low BMI (p<0.001), comorbid asthma (p<0.001), and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (p=0.032) remained significant independent risk factors for COPD in smokers. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that COPD patients who consumed fewer fruits and vegetables had lower levels of vitamin C intake (p=0.004). The findings of our study suggest that smokers who are older, have a lower BMI, and comorbid asthma are at an increased risk of developing COPD. Conversely, higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as increased intake of vitamin C, may help reduce this risk. Additionally, our results indicate that among smokers with lower fruit and vegetable intake, COPD patients tend to have lower levels of vitamin C consumption.",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2025,10.2147/COPD.S489581,Xuequn Guo,Hongsheng Lin,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujian, 362000, People's Republic of China.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujian, 362000, People's Republic of China.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujian, 362000, People's Republic of China.; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujian, 362000, People's Republic of China.","Humans, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, Male, Female, Cross-Sectional Studies, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Smoking, Protective Factors, United States, Adult, Smokers, Aged, Nutrition Surveys, Databases, Factual, Risk Assessment, Comorbidity, Diet, Risk Reduction Behavior, Lung, Diet, Healthy","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fruits and vegetables, nutrition, oxidation, smoking, vitamin C"
40237293,Assessing Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Hip Arthroscopy: A Propensity-matched Comparison of Adolescents and Adults.,"Hip arthroscopy is a commonly performed procedure in adolescents with hip pathology. However, there is limited data on venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in this population, resulting in minimal guidance on appropriate VTE prophylaxis, with the bulk of current guidance extrapolated from the adult population. Therefore, this study aims to assess overall rates of VTE in the adolescent population as well as compare these rates to a matched cohort of adult patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. This retrospective cohort study drew data from the TriNetX platform between January 1, 2003 and March 1, 2024. Adolescent patients, ages 13 to 18, were matched to adult patients (19 and older) undergoing hip arthroscopy, accounting for sex, tobacco use, oral contraceptive use, diabetes mellitus, and overweight/obesity. Outcomes of interest were deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) within 90 days after the procedure. Overall rates were calculated and compared between cohorts. Statistical significance was set at P<0.01. A total of 3655 patients were successfully matched with a mean age of 16 in the adolescent cohort and 35 in the adult cohort. The overall rates of DVT were similar between cohorts, at 1% for adolescent patients and 0.9% for adults (RR: 0.892; 95% CI: 0.559-1.423; P=0.63). All VTE events (combined DVT and PE) were also similar at 1.1% for adolescent patients and 1.0% in adults (RR: 0.925; 95% CI: 0.593-1.443; P=0.73). This study found no significant difference in VTE between adolescent and adult patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. The overall rate of VTE was relatively high in adolescent patients, at 1.1%, suggesting additional attention to VTE and potential chemoprophylaxis may be warranted in select patients.

40241145,Buprenorphine discontinuation and utilization of psychosocial services: a national study in the Veterans Health Administration.,"Longer duration of treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is associated with improved outcomes, but long-term retention remains a challenge. Research is needed to identify psychosocial interventions that support MOUD retention. To address this gap, we examined associations between a wide range of psychosocial services and buprenorphine treatment discontinuation across 18 months among a large cohort of Veterans initiating buprenorphine nationwide. We identified a cohort of patients with new buprenorphine initiation in 2017-2018 in Veterans Health Administration electronic health record data (N = 11,704). We examined prescription fills for up to 18 months after initiation. The primary outcome was first discontinuation of buprenorphine. We examined a variety of services, including psychotherapy in specialty substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health clinics, other healthcare services, and residential programs. To examine time-varying associations between psychosocial services and risk of discontinuation, we fit extended Cox regression models for each service separately and simultaneously. Overall, 80.5% of patients discontinued buprenorphine at least once within 18 months. Risk of discontinuation was 18% (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87) relatively lower following SUD psychotherapy and 26% (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15,1.39) higher following residential treatment. Several services, including residential treatment, were associated with greater risk of subsequent buprenorphine discontinuation, whereas only SUD psychotherapy was consistently associated with lower risk of later discontinuation. These findings emphasize the need for future studies to increase understandings of beneficial and disruptive components of psychosocial services to improve treatment retention among patients receiving MOUD.",Addiction science & clinical practice,2025-04-16,10.1186/s13722-025-00562-1,Emma N Cleary,Patrick D Quinn,"Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, 1101 E.

40242166,Association of dietary inflammatory index on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in U.S. adults with metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease.,"An inflammatory diet is pivotal in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) development. However, it remains unclear whether Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), which serves as a reliable indicator to assess pro-inflammatory diet, have associative effects on mortality outcomes of MASLD. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 1999 to 2018 years were included. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were used to estimate survival probabilities, while Cox regression analysis and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to assess the association between DII and mortality outcomes. The concordance index (C-index) evaluated the accuracy of multivariate-adjusted DII for mortality among MASLD participants. The cohort consisted of 4,510 men and 4,323 women with a median age of 52 years. Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that high levels of DII were significantly associated with the all-cause mortality of participants with MASLD (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.49,  Elevated DII levels are linked to higher mortality in adults with MASLD, underscoring the index's utility in predicting mortality risks.

40243189,How Do Venous Thromboembolism Rates in Adolescents and Adults Compare After Arthroscopic Knee Surgery? A Propensity-Matched Study.,"Arthroscopic knee procedures such as meniscus and ACL repairs are cornerstone interventions in pediatric and sports orthopaedics. While venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a rare yet devastating complication in major joint surgeries, its association with minimally invasive procedures remains relatively unexplored. Emerging evidence shows rates of VTE in adolescent orthopaedic patients approaching that of adults, highlighting the need to further characterize the unique risk profile of this population. Therefore, this study aims to compare VTE rates, risk factors, and chemoprophylaxis use in adolescents versus adults undergoing arthroscopic knee procedures. A retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network identified 301,585 patients who underwent knee arthroscopy from January 2003 to January 2023, including 29,984 adolescents (aged 14 to 17) and 271,601 adults (aged 18 years or older). Propensity score matching based on sex and relevant comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, oral contraceptive (OCP) use, and obesity yielded balanced cohorts of 29,984 each. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed for preliminary assessment of the risk factors associated with VTE. P<0.01 was considered significant. Adults had a higher 90-day incidence of DVT (1.3% vs. 0.8%) and PE (0.3% vs. 0.2%) than adolescents. Combined DVT/PE incidence was 1.5% in adults and 0.8% in adolescents (RR: 1.782). Univariate analysis showed OCP use (OR: 3.167), obesity (OR: 3.445), tobacco use (OR: 23.975), and diabetes (OR: 34.064) were significant VTE risk factors in adolescents; sex was not. Adults more frequently received postoperative chemoprophylaxis (24% vs. 20%, P<0.001), with aspirin being the most common agent (23% in adults vs. 19% in adolescents, P<0.001). Adolescents undergoing knee arthroscopy have a lower risk of VTE compared with adults, with an incidence below 1%. Routine VTE prophylaxis may not be necessary for all adolescents but should be considered for those with significant risk factors, including diabetes, tobacco use, and obesity. Further research is warranted to refine prophylaxis guidelines in this population.

A retrospective study was conducted for cases with OPC diagnosis during years 2018-2021 who had known p16 status using data of USA from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program [Incidence - SEER Research Limited-Field Data, 22 Registries (excl IL and MA), Nov 2023 Sub (2000-2021)]. In the statistical analyses, death was considered as a competing event for the development of a hepatobiliary SPM. Bias due to unbalanced baseline characteristics was eliminated by adjustments using propensity score and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Risk of development of a hepatobiliary SPM was assessed using propensity-score-adjusted time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)]. Overall, 25759 cases with tumor status of p16(-) (6353) and p16(+) (19406) with median (interquartile range) follow-up times of 14 (6, 26) and 20 (9, 32) months, respectively, were included. From these, 48 had a hepatobiliary SPM. Compared to HPV-related OPC, HPV-unrelated OPC had significantly elevated risk of synchronous all hepatobiliary SPMs [aHR= 2.39 (95 % CI, 1.11-5.15); P = 0.026] and synchronous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SPM [aHR= 2.86 (95 % CI, 1.18-6.92); P = 0.020], but not metachronous ones. Curves of cumulative incidence of a hepatobiliary (or HCC) SPM and cumulative survival probability for those with a hepatobiliary SPM, both stratified by p16 status and adjusted by IPTW, were generated. The median survival time among patients with a hepatobiliary SPM was shorter for HPV-unrelated OPC (0.8 years) compared to HPV-related OPC (2.6 years). The observed elevated risk was likely due to heavy alcohol and tobacco use and the protective role of HPV infection against HCC development in carriers of hepatitis C virus.",Cancer epidemiology,2025-04-17,10.1016/j.canep.2025.102826,Shaopan Cao,Mehran Asad Ayoubi,"The Third Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, No. 2519 Jiefang Road, Chaoyang District, Changchun City, Jilin Province postal code: 130026, China.

This study aims to evaluate the association between preoperative malnutrition laboratory markers with the risk of 90-day postoperative complications and 2-year revision rates in TSA patients. This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX database to assess TSA patients with and without preoperative malnutrition markers (albumin < 3.5 g/dL, transferrin < 204 mg/dL, and total leukocyte count < 1500 cells/mm A total of 1936 patients per group were analyzed after matching. Malnourished patients had significantly higher risks of 90-day major complications, including sepsis (RR: 2.400, P = .016), myocardial infarction (RR: 3.4, P < .001), readmission (RR: 1.6, P = .003), pneumonia (RR: 1.667, P = .018), renal failure (RR: 1.806, P = .003), and blood transfusion (RR: 5.1, P < .001).

40257275,Non-Tobacco Nicotine Use and Complications in Free Flap Repair in Head and Neck Cancer.,"Assess associations between non-tobacco nicotine usage and free flap repair complications in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Propensity-matched retrospective cohort study. The TriNetX database was queried for HNC patients who underwent free flap procedures from 2010 to 2024. Among these patients, the NIC cohort was defined as those with dependence on nicotine prior to surgery, but without the use of cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or other tobacco products. The non-NIC cohort was defined as patients with no nicotine dependence, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or other tobacco product use prior to surgery. Cohorts were propensity-matched based on demographics and comorbidities. Primary outcomes included free flap failure, blood vessel repair, and other revisionary procedures (associated with wound disruption or repair) within 30 days of the primary reconstruction. Secondary outcomes included infection, pneumonia, cardiopulmonary complications, and hematoma within 30 days. Following propensity matching, 1324 patients were included in each cohort. Across all free flaps, non-tobacco nicotine use was associated with a significantly increased risk of other revision procedures (RR: 1.230 [95% CI: 1.013, 1.493], p = 0.036), sepsis (RR: 1.563 [95% CI: 1.009, 2.419], p = 0.045), fistula (RR: 1.588 [95% CI: 1.041, 2.423], p = 0.032), cardiovascular complications (RR: 1.420 [95% CI: 1.054, 1.914], p = 0.021), pneumonia (RR: 2.055 [95% CI: 1.570, 2.689], p < 0.001), and pulmonary embolism (RR: 2.220 [95% CI: 1.217, 3.933], p = 0.008). Non-tobacco nicotine use is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications in HNC patients following free flap reconstruction.

Multi-system organ involvement, including neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and ocular signs, as well as laboratory abnormalities were observed. Introduction of a chewable formulation in October 2023 likely attributed to a marked increase in exposures. Accompanying this rise in overdose exposures, a notable escalation in multisystemic effects was seen, including neurological, gastrointestinal signs, cardiovascular disturbances, ocular irregularities, renal and hepatic injury, and complete blood count (CBC) hematological abnormalities.

To examine the relationships between opioid tapering and subsequent overdose (OD), opioid use disorder (OUD), and all-cause mortality among older adults on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). Nested case-control design. A cohort of older (≥ 65 years) Medicare beneficiaries with chronic non-cancer pain who were on LTOT was identified from 2012-2020 5% national Medicare claims data. The key independent variable was rate of opioid tapering, operationalized as a monthly dose change percentage with four levels: steady dose (± 10% dose change), slow tapering (10-40% dose reduction), rapid tapering (> 40% dose reduction), and dose escalation (> 10% dose increase). The outcome variables were OD, OUD, and all-cause mortality. Conditional logistic regression was conducted on matched samples to evaluate the associations between opioid tapering and the outcomes. Among a cohort of 82,295, 1333 cases of OD, 4933 cases of OUD, and 5971 cases of all-cause mortality were identified. In primary analyses, after controlling for all covariates, compared with steady dose, the odds of OD were significantly lower (aOR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.55-0.99) for rapid tapering and significantly higher (aOR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.64-2.65) for dose escalation. Compared to steady dose, the odds of OUD were significantly lower (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.46-0.60) for rapid tapering and significantly higher (aOR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.42-1.81) for dose escalation. Compared to steady dose, significantly higher odds for all-cause mortality were found among patients undergoing rapid tapering (aOR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.14-1.44), and dose escalation (aOR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.34-1.71). Sensitivity analyses showed that mortality outcome is sensitive to variations in cohort selections. The results suggest that any opioid dose change for patients on LTOT may negatively affect all-cause mortality.

40267668,Biologic switching in psoriatic arthritis: Insights from real-world data and key risk factors.,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, heterogeneous inflammatory condition requiring personalized treatment strategies. Biologic therapy switching reflects the disease's dynamic nature and aims to optimize disease control while balancing efficacy, safety, and patient-specific factors. To analyze real-world switching patterns of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in PsA patients, identify associated risk factors, and provide insights into predictors of mode-of-action switching. This retrospective cohort study utilized the Clalit Health Services database (2005-2023), encompassing 9607 PsA patients in Israel. Patients initiating bDMARDs were tracked for therapy switches. Clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic variables were extracted, and statistical analyses compared characteristics between switchers and non-switchers. Patterns of switching were stratified by the number of switches and study periods (2005-2014, 2015-2023). Among 3851 patients initiating bDMARDs, 1848 (48 %) switched therapy at least once. Anti-TNF therapy was the dominant first-line choice, but switching to anti-IL17 therapy became prevalent as the first switch in both single-switch and multi-switch scenarios. Subsequent switches often involved cycling back to anti-TNF or transitioning to other modes of action, such as anti-IL23 or JAK inhibitors. Switching patterns remained consistent across study periods. Switchers were more likely to be female (56.5 vs. 50.6 %, p < 0.001), obese (28.1 vs. 22.6 %, p < 0.001), smokers (41.6 vs. 37.1 %, p = 0.005), and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (34.1 vs 31.4 %, p = 0.04). These factors were all independently associated with switching in mechanism of action on multivariate analysis. Cross class biologic switching is common in PsA management (48 %) and influenced by patient demographics and comorbidities. Switching patterns were consistent across time periods despite expanding therapeutic options.",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2025.152737,Amir Haddad,Devy Zisman,"Rheumatology Unit, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel; Department of Epidemiology, Clalit health services, Haifa, Israel.

40267726,"""I can't breathe"" - A study of civil litigated cases on prone restraint deaths.","Prone restraint by law enforcement has come under scrutiny due to its association with in-custody deaths and subsequent civil litigation. The true incidence, risk factors, and physiological mechanisms contributing to these fatalities remain poorly understood. This study aims to assess prone restraint-related death occurrences and identify associated risk factors by analyzing legal case records. This retrospective study examined United States legal records from the National Legal Database, LexisNexis, covering 2010 to 2019. Cases were identified using the MeSH term ""prone restraint cardiac arrest."" Data extracted included demographic and case-specific variables such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration of prone restraint, application of additional body weight, race, use of a conducted electrical weapon (CEW), presence of body camera footage, reports of excited delirium, drug intoxication, settlement amounts, and documented statements of ""I can't breathe."" A total of 229 cases met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The majority of subjects (98 %) were male, with an average age at death of 37 years. Among cases with available data, 38 % were African American, 33 % had obesity, and 64 % involved recreational stimulant drug use. In 58 % of cases, death occurred after one to 5 min of prone restraint. Additional body weight was applied in 80 % of cases, while CEWs were used in 39 %. Excited delirium was reported in 31 % of cases. More than 20 % of individuals were recorded saying, ""I can't breathe."" The average reported settlement in resolved cases was $2.5 million. This study represents the largest case series of 229 reported prone restraint-related deaths to be reported in the medical literature, yet the true incidence remains uncertain. Further research is essential to better understand the prevalence, contributing risk factors, and potential mitigation strategies.

Incomplete PROM collection, however, introduces nonresponse bias and limits the generalizability of time-based analyses of outcomes. This study compared PROM-respondents and nonrespondents in spine surgery to characterize survey nonresponse and improve equitable patient representation in time series PROM analyses. Retrospective study. Patients undergoing surgery at a large, tertiary care center in the United States between July 2009 and February 2023 for lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis (LSS), lumbar spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis (LSP), or cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). The primary outcome was completeness of available PROM records, which was defined as having Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Global Health scores once within 2 years preoperatively and twice within 2 years postoperatively. Demographic variables of age, sex, race, marital status, employment, insurance, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and Area Deprivation Index (ADI) were obtained from the electronic medical record. These characteristics were compared by PROM-completeness within each pathology group. Comparative analyses between the PROM-complete and PROM-incomplete patients within each pathology group were conducted using the Satterthwaite t-test for continuous variables, Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal variables. Among patients with complete PROMs, availability of PROMIS-Global Health within 2 years pre- and postoperatively was plotted in bins of 84- and 168-days width to characterize the distribution of time points represented in PROM data for these patients. To visualize geographic variation in likelihood of representation in time series PROMs analyses, census block-level heatmaps were generated for each pathology group showing predicted probability of PROM-completeness by logistic regression with age, sex, race, marital status, employment status, insurance category, BMI, and smoking status as predictor variables. About 4,938 patients (1,751 LSS, 1,711 LSP, 1,476 CSM) were analyzed. PROM-complete patients varied significantly from PROM-incomplete patients in demographic distributions. PROM-complete patients were more likely of White race, married, retired, and less likely to be current smokers. LSS and CSM PROM-complete patients were more likely to have Medicare insurance than PROM-incomplete patients. Patients completing PROMs for spine surgery may differ from those who do not, with greater representation of White race, being married, retiree status, and Medicare insurance among those with complete PROMs. As PROMs are further incorporated into physician evaluation, value-based reimbursement, and predictive analytics for surgical outcomes, understanding survey nonresponse will be critical for generating equitable, individualized, and informed applications to support healthcare decisions.",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,2025-04-22,10.1016/j.spinee.2025.04.022,David Shin,Ghaith Habboub,"Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.

It is crucial to identify the putative time-varying population-level factors of age, period, and cohort that influenced the decrease in smoking prevalence so we can maintain the downward trend. We used 49 years of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analysis to examine lifecycle, historical, and generational distribution of smoking among Americans aged 18-74 years old. The prevalence of smoking has declined tremendously from 1971 to 2020 because American adults over the age of ~ 27 had a lower probability of cigarette use, but the rates of decrease have been unequal among birth cohorts. We uncovered the putative temporal contributors to population-level decreases in the prevalence of current smoking among American adults over the last nearly fifty years.

This study evaluates 90-day postoperative complication rates and identifies risk factors for adverse outcomes in RSA and TSA patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX Research NLP Network to identify patients aged 65-90 years who underwent RSA or TSA for OA from 2006 to 2024. 1:1 propensity score matching controlled for demographics and comorbidities. Orthopedic and infectious complications were compared using multivariate logistic regression. The final matched cohort included 4,117 RSA and TSA patients. RSA was associated with significantly higher odds of orthopedic complications compared to TSA. Significant risk factors for orthopedic complications in RSA included nicotine dependence (OR, 1.592; P=0.001) and hypertension (OR, 1.545; P=0.001). In TSA, risk factors included male sex (OR, 0.702; P=0.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.650; P=0.016), and obesity (OR, 1.776; P<0.001).

To estimate the prevalence of and and factors associated with AUD diagnoses among commercially insured individuals who take PrEP. This retrospective cohort study used US health care claims data to identify individuals aged 16 to 64 years who received at least 1 new PrEP prescription between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from June 2024 to February 2025. Sociodemographic characteristics included patient age, sex, geographic location, employment status, and type of health insurance. Clinical characteristics included sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis and testing, use of psychotherapy services, and diagnosis of other mental health conditions. The main outcome was an AUD diagnosis within 6 months before or after the date of PrEP initiation. Among individuals with an AUD diagnosis, receipt of medications for AUD (MAUDs), including Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MAUDs (acamprosate, disulfiram, and oral and injectable naltrexone) and non-FDA-approved MAUDs (baclofen, gabapentin, and topiramate) was determined. The study cohort included 43 913 individuals receiving PrEP (mean [SD] age, 35.8 [10.94] years; 35 027 [90.1%] male assigned at birth). There were 6274 individuals (14.29%) who had an AUD diagnosis, with 1245 (2.84%) and 5029 (11.45%) receiving their diagnosis before and after PrEP initiation, respectively. The sociodemographic and clinical factors that were associated with an AUD diagnosis were similar whether AUD was diagnosed before or after PrEP initiation, including male sex assigned at birth (before: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], aOR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.73; after: aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and the presence of other mental health diagnoses such as depression (before: aOR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.78-3.84; after: aOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.88-3.49), anxiety (before: aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.83-2.55; after: aOR, 2.24; 95% CI, 2.04-2.46), and any substance use disorder (before: aOR, 14.54; 95% CI, 12.46-16.96; after: aOR, 13.09; 95% CI, 11.82-14.49).

40285766,Postoperative Psychiatric Outcomes After Upper-Extremity Amputations.,"Upper-extremity amputations alter patient form and, in cases of proximal amputation, may diminish overall function. Psychological outcomes following these procedures have been evaluated primarily on a single-institution basis. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of psychiatric conditions following upper-extremity amputation on a population-wide basis. The TriNetX database was queried for all patients treated for upper-extremity amputations between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2022. Preoperative and date-of-surgery diagnoses were collected to identify conditions preceding amputation. The 3-year incidence of mental health conditions was evaluated based on International Classification of Diseases codes. Chi-squared analyses were used to evaluate incidence between amputation levels. Odds ratios were used to compare outcome rates relative to the general population, as well as against that of the general, upper extremity surgical population. A total of 25,091 patients underwent 25,415 amputations during our period of analysis. This group consisted of 23,416 transmetacarpal or digital amputations, 956 transforearm or wrist disarticulations, and 1,043 transhumerus or shoulder disarticulations. Traumatic etiologies were the most common across all levels. Increases in the rate of depression, general anxiety disorder, psychosis, mood disorders, alcohol or opioid abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidality were observed in amputations at and proximal to the wrist compared to those isolated within the hand. Except for general anxiety disorder, the incidence of all psychiatric outcomes was higher relative to the general population. Compared to patients undergoing nonamputation upper extremity surgical procedures, matched analyses revealed increased odds of psychiatric illness at all amputation levels proximal to the phalanges. Approximately one in six patients who undergo an upper extremity amputation develop a psychiatric condition within 3 years, at an increased rate compared to the general population. Patients with more proximal amputations face a greater burden of psychiatric illness compared to those with more distal amputations.

Research evaluating buprenorphine use in pregnancy, its effects on the maternal-infant dyad, and in comparison to no treatment is limited. To determine if treatment with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in pregnancy is associated with improved maternal and infant outcomes compared to no treatment among mothers with OUD. This retrospective cohort study included maternal-infant dyads continuously enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from 20 weeks' estimated gestational age to 6 weeks post partum between 2010 and 2021. Medicaid administrative was linked to birth and death certificates. Data analysis was conducted from April to October 2024. Buprenorphine use during pregnancy. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, infant death, severe maternal morbidity (SMM), intensive care unit admission, and maternal death. Logistic regression and propensity scores with overlap weighting were used to calculate adjusted predicted probabilities for adverse outcomes. Among 14 463 maternal-infant dyads, 7469 (51.6%) received buprenorphine treatment (median [IQR] maternal age, 27 [24-31] years). There was a statistically significant lower rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes among dyads treated with buprenorphine compared to untreated dyads (25.4% vs 30.8%; P < .001); the treatment group also had a lower rate of SMM events (5.4% vs 6.9%; P < .001), preterm births (14.1% vs 20.0%; P < .001), and NICU admissions (15.2% vs 17.2%; P = .001). In adjusted analyses, those with buprenorphine treatment had a 5.1 percentage point (pp; 95% CI, 3.5-6.7 pp) lower probability of any adverse outcomes, including a 1.2 pp (95% CI, 0.4-2.1 pp) lower probability of SMM, 1.7 pp (95% CI, 0.4-2.9 pp) lower probability of NICU admission, and 5.3 pp (95% CI, 4.0-6.6 pp) lower probability of preterm birth. The number needed to treat to avoid an adverse pregnancy outcome was 20. In this cohort study of pregnant individuals with OUD, buprenorphine treatment was associated with improved outcomes for the mother and infant, underscoring the need to improve access to treatment nationwide.",JAMA health forum,2025-04-27,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1814,Sunaya R Krishnapura,Stephen W Patrick,"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.; Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.; Health Services Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.","Humans, Female, Pregnancy, Buprenorphine, Retrospective Studies, Adult, Opioid-Related Disorders, Pregnancy Outcome, Tennessee, Pregnancy Complications, Infant, Newborn, Opiate Substitution Treatment, United States, Medicaid, Young Adult",N/A
40290132,Prescription opioid use and substance use disorder in US women (2006-2022): a retrospective cohort study.,"Research has shown that multiple deployments may have adverse effects on active-duty servicewomen and women civilian dependents of active-duty servicemembers. There is concern that the associated stress could induce sustained prescription opioid use and substance use disorder (SUD). We sought to evaluate the incidence of sustained opioid use and SUD among servicewomen and women civilian dependents during 2006-2013, a period of increased operational intensity, compared to similar individuals in 2014-2022. We employed Military Health System claims data to identify servicewomen and dependents who were diagnosed with SUD or demonstrated sustained prescription opioid use (i.e., six months of uninterrupted use). The incidence of sustained opioid use (primary outcome) and SUD associated (secondary outcome) with 2006-2013 was compared to 2014-2022 among servicewomen and dependents. Multivariable log binomial regression was used to adjust for confounding. Ethnicity was not available in our dataset. 4,876,209 individuals were included. The average age (standard deviation [SD]) of the cohorts under study were 26.6 (SD 8.2) for active duty 2006-2013, 26.0 (SD 8.0) for active duty 2014-2022, 35.3 (SD 13.1) for dependents 2006-2013 and 33.6 (SD 12.1) for dependents 2014-2022. Compared to civilian dependents in 2014-2022, servicewomen from 2006 to 2013 demonstrated an increased risk of sustained prescription opioid use (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.46-1.53). In 2014-2022, servicewomen had a lower risk compared to dependents (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.45-0.49), while dependents in 2006-2013 were also at higher risk (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.56-1.60). Servicewomen in 2006-2013 were at significantly greater risk of developing SUD (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.08). During 2014-2022, servicewomen displayed a lower risk when compared to dependents (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.79-0.81). Dependents in 2006-2013 showed a higher risk (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.24-1.25). We found significant increases in the risks of sustained opioid use and SUD among servicewomen and civilian dependents during a period of increased operational intensity (2006-2013). We believe these findings reflect the deleterious effects of emotional stress, insufficient support structures, and military sexual trauma.

40296928,Predictors of Mortality Among Patients With Opioid Use Disorder: Insights From the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Readmission Database.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with significantly increased mortality rates compared to the general population, driven by overdose risk, high-risk behaviors, and comorbid conditions. While opioid agonist treatment reduces mortality, identifying risk factors for death among individuals with OUD remains critical for improving outcomes. A retrospective analysis of the 2020 National Readmission Database identified OUD admissions using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Patients over 18 years of age were included, and statistical analyses, including logistic regression, assessed 30-day readmission and mortality predictors. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics for Windows, version 1.0.0.1327 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Nonsurvivors were generally older (median age: 58 vs. 47 years) and had a higher prevalence of severe comorbidities, including cardiac arrest (24.1% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.001), respiratory failure (83.0% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (61.9% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001). Mortality was more common among patients with Medicare (44.4% vs. 31.7%) and in larger hospitals. Psychiatric conditions, such as depression and suicidal ideation, were more frequent in survivors, suggesting potential protective effects or earlier intervention. Multivariable analysis identified cardiac arrest (odds ratio, OR: 20.210, p < 0.001), respiratory failure (OR: 9.993, p < 0.001), and liver failure (OR: 4.298, p < 0.001) as the strongest mortality predictors, while female sex and psychiatric disorders were associated with lower mortality risk. Mortality among patients with OUD is influenced by age, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and healthcare disparities. Integrated care approaches that address both medical and psychiatric conditions are essential for improving survival outcomes. Future research should focus on targeted interventions to mitigate high-risk factors and enhance harm reduction strategies for this vulnerable population.",Cureus,2025-03-01,10.7759/cureus.81405,Naga Venkata Satish Babu Bodapati,Chrishanti Anna Joseph,"Department of Psyhciatry, Sunshine Behavioral Health Services, Bakersfield, USA.; Department of Computer Engineering, Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad, IND.; Department of Business Administration, National Louis University, Tampa, USA.; Department of Technology and Innovation, City National Bank, Los Angeles, USA.; Department of Technology and Innovation, Info Services LLC, Livonia, USA.; Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.",N/A,"30-day readmission, comorbidities and risk factors, healthcare cost and utilization project (hcup), mortality predictors, opioid use disorder (oud)"
40299223,Receipt of medications for opioid use disorders among veterans by race/ethnicity and legal involvement: an observational study of electronic health records.,"The Veterans Health Administration has made strides to improve access to medications for opioid use disorder overall. However, quality improvement methods to assess treatment gaps may not sufficiently detect differences in medication access by intersecting patient factors, which may have multiplicative rather than additive effects. This study aimed to determine whether race/ethnicity and legal involvement interact in receipt of medications for opioid use disorder among Veterans Health Administration patients. Using national electronic health record data from Fiscal Years 2021-2022, we examined the receipt of medications for opioid use disorder among veterans diagnosed with opioid use disorder who received healthcare at Veterans Health Administration facilities (n = 65,883). We conducted a mixed effects multivariable logistic regression model to examine an interaction effect of race/ethnicity and legal involvement with receipt of any medications for opioid use disorder, both unadjusted and adjusted for patient and facility characteristics. In an adjusted logistic regression model, the interaction effect indicated that non-Hispanic Black veterans with legal involvement had the lowest odds of medications for opioid use disorder receipt compared to non-Hispanic White veterans without legal involvement (adjusted odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.59-0.77, p <.0001). Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native patients without legal involvement (adjusted odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.73-0.99, p =.04) also had lower odds of receipt of medications for opioid use disorder compared to non-Hispanic White patients without legal involvement. Non-Hispanic White veterans with legal involvement (adjusted odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.14, p =.03) had higher odds of receipt of medications for opioid use disorder compared to non-Hispanic White patients without legal involvement. Veterans Health Administration quality improvement efforts should monitor interacting racial and legal status factors and understand and address patient, clinical, and regulatory barriers to medications for opioid use disorder among Black veterans with legal involvement.",Health & justice,2025-04-29,10.1186/s40352-025-00336-6,Andrea K Finlay,Alex H S Harris,"VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park, USA.

40306197,Widening disparities in all-cause and despair-related mortality among Swedish youths: Disentangling selection and causation.,"Rising rates of ""deaths of despair"" - mortality from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related causes - have contributed to widening educational disparities in mortality. It is not known to what extent the trends are due to selection effects (health causing education, or a third factor causing both) or social causation (education affecting health). This study investigated the relative contribution of selection and causation for these trends, focusing on the recently documented widening achievement-based disparities in mortality among Swedish youths. To this end, two cohorts of Swedish compulsory school graduates (graduating in 1992-1993 and 2009-2010, respectively) were followed for eight years after graduation using comprehensive administrative data (n = 424,715). Logistic regression models were used to assess the role of pre-graduation selection, while inverse odds ratio-weighting was used to assess mediation by post-graduation socioeconomic disadvantages. Roughly half of the association between low achievement and all-cause and despair-related mortality within cohorts was due to selection. However, selection effects did not explain the widening disparities over time. Socioeconomic mediators accounted for most of the remaining disparities within cohorts as well as of for most of the increase in these disparities over time. Overall, social causation was more important than selection in explaining the widening educational disparities in all-cause and despair-related mortality. We conclude that low academic achievement increasingly constrains life-course prospects of Swedish youths, amplifying its adverse health consequences. These findings highlight the need for lower barriers in the education system and for viable educational and employment pathways for low-achieving students in an increasingly knowledge-intensive labor market.",Social science & medicine (1982),2025-07-01,10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118130,Björn Högberg,Simone Scarpa,"Department of Social Work, Umeå University, Sweden; Centre for Demographic and Ageing Research, Umeå University, Sweden.

40307423,Multimorbidity of mental health and substance use disorders among housed and homeless U.S. veterans.,"Housing can be an important social determinant of mental health, which is why it is important to understand how mental health disorders (MHDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) cluster and vary by housing instability. This study examined rates of comorbid MHDs and SUDs among three groups of U.S. veterans: those experiencing homelessness, those in supported housing, and those independently housed. Administrative data on a national cohort of 5,402,062 veterans (including 181,131 homeless veterans and 29,166 veterans in supported housing) enrolled in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 2021 to 2023 were analyzed. Among homeless veterans, 28.3% had a SUD diagnosis, 62.9% a MHD diagnosis, and 24.7% comorbid MHD/SUD. Among veterans in supported housing, 38.2% had a SUD diagnosis, 67.3% a MHD diagnosis, and 32.0% comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses. Among independently housed veterans, 7.9% had a SUD diagnosis, 41.6% a MHD diagnosis, and 5.8% comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses. Homeless veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD used significantly more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than veterans in supported housing; in turn, supported housing veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD used significantly more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than independently housed veterans. Among homeless veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses, those with addiction to central nervous system (CNS) stimulants used more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than those with addiction to CNS depressants. In conclusion, the psychiatric epidemiology and comorbidity of veterans varies by housing situation, and there is continued need for psychiatric treatment among homeless veterans who enter supported housing.",Scientific reports,2025-04-30,10.1038/s41598-025-99394-x,Jack Tsai,Hind Beydoun,"United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Homeless Programs Office, Washington, DC, USA.

40310602,Factors that Contribute to Neonatal Mortality at a Community Hospital.,"The prevalence of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) in the United States is 5.74 per 1000 live births. In Maryland, the prevalence is 6.75 per 1000 and occurs nearly twice as frequently in Black than in white populations. At MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center (MFSMC), Electronic Medical Records (EMR) show that IUFDs are 2.5 times greater in Black than white women. This analysis aims to identify factors that contribute to this health disparity. We performed a retrospective chart review of deliveries at MFSMC between 2018 and 2020. Literature-supported variables were collected for all pregnancies that ended in IUFD. Using logistic regression models, these factors were analyzed to isolate predictors for IUFD and association with race. The same predictors were compared to those of women who delivered live infants during this period. Without adjustment, the odds of having an IUFD are 2.21 times higher for Black mothers than for white mothers at MFSMC. No other unadjusted odds ratios between comorbid risk factors and the chance of IUFD were significant. After adjusting for diabetes, growth restriction, substance abuse, and hypertension, the odds of having an IUFD are 2.31 times higher for Black than white mothers. Black mothers experience increased risk for IUFD, after controlling for other pertinent factors. This disparity should be addressed by reducing healthcare provider bias, increasing maternal health services, and providing comprehensive patient education.",Maternal and child health journal,2025-05-01,10.1007/s10995-025-04094-7,Chrystal Pristell,Fernando Mena,"Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies, Washington, DC, USA. chrystal.l.pristell@medstar.net.; Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies, Washington, DC, USA.; Medstar Health Research Institute, Hyattsville, MD, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center, Rosedale, MD, USA.","Adult, Female, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Pregnancy, Black or African American, Fetal Death, Hospitals, Community, Infant Mortality, Logistic Models, Maryland, Prevalence, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, White","Fetal death, Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), Maternal health services, Social determinants of health (SDOH), Systemic racism"
40312164,Impact of peripheral nerve blocks on chronic opioid use after elective total knee arthroplasty from a large US claims database.,"Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), either single-shot injection or continuous catheter infusion, are increasingly used in total knee arthroplasties (TKAs). Although recent data show equivalence between both modalities in immediate perioperative analgesia, comparative data on longer-term outcomes such as chronic opioid use are scarce. Using US Merative MarketScan commercial claims data (2018-22; n=126 860 TKAs), we compared: (1) patients receiving PNB vs those who did not; and (2) single-shot vs continuous catheter infusion PNB. Primary outcomes were: (1) 'chronic opioid dependence' (>120 pills of opioids prescribed or >10 prescriptions between postoperative day 90 and 180); and (2) 'chronic opioid use' (any opioid refill between postoperative day 90 and 180). Multivariable models measured associations between PNB modalities and outcomes. Incidence of 'chronic opioid dependence' was 0.7%, 0.8%, and 0.9% among patients without PNB, with single-shot PNB, and with continuous PNB, respectively. For 'chronic opioid use', this was 12.6%, 13.8%, and 14.3%. Multivariable analyses indicated no association between PNB (yes/no and modality) utilisation and 'chronic opioid dependence'. However, single-shot (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02; P<0.001) and continuous PNB (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02; P<0.001) compared with no PNB use were associated with slightly higher odds of 'chronic opioid use'. Our results did not show any clinically meaningful differences in postoperative chronic opioid use or dependence across patients receiving single-shot PNB or continuous PNB treatment.

40312716,Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome modifies smoking-related risk for cardiovascular diseases: findings from an observational cohort study in UK Biobank.,"The present study aims to investigate the association of smoking behaviors and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to evaluate whether the cardiovascular benefits of smoking cessation vary across different CKM conditions. This study included 242,636 white European participants from the UK Biobank who were classified as CKM syndrome Stages 0 to 3 and free of CVD at baseline. Covariates adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations of CKM syndrome with the risks of total CVD, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and 13 CVD subtypes. The impact of smoking behavior across different CKM stages and the joint effect of smoking and CKM syndrome on CVD risk were also evaluated. To investigate the potential effect modification by CKM syndrome, we examined the multiplicative scale by interaction terms in Cox models, and quantified the additive scale using statistics such as the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). The risk of total CVD, stroke, and CHD increased progressively with advancing CKM stages, with Stage 3 associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 3.38 (95% CI: 3.05-3.74), 3.01 (2.49-3.64), and 3.65 (3.25-4.10), respectively (P for trend < 0.001). The time required to reduce CVD risk to a level not significantly different from that of never smokers tends to be longer for individuals with advancing CKM stage: smokers at Stages 0-1 achieved this after approximately 10 years of cessation, whereas those at Stages 2-3 required more than 25 years. Compared with never smokers at CKM Stage 0, current smokers at CKM Stage 3 had substantially higher risk of total CVD (HR = 4.14, 95% CI: 3.54-4.83) and several subtypes, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR = 17.68, 95% CI: 6.33-49.43) and peripheral vascular disease (HR = 10.53, 95% CI: 6.79-16.34). CKM syndrome appeared to act as a positive additive effect modifier in smoking-related risk of total CVD (RERI = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.32), as well as several CVD subtypes, suggesting that the combined effect of smoking and CKM progression exceeds the sum of their individual effects. Our finding emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation among individuals with advanced CKM syndrome, as they face heightened CVD risk. However, compared to those at earlier CKM stages, the short-term benefits of smoking cessation may be less pronounced in this population. Interventions that combine smoking cessation promotion with CKM syndrome management may yield greater reductions in the risk of several CVD outcomes.",BMC public health,2025-05-01,10.1186/s12889-025-22865-3,Xinhui Liu,Fuzhong Xue,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.; Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine of Shandong University, Chest Pain Center, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.; Key Laboratory of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine of Shandong Province, Key Laboratory of Cardiopulmonary-Cerebral Resuscitation Research of Shandong Province, Shandong Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Key Laboratory: Magnetic Field-free Medicine & Functional Imaging, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.; Department of Neurology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No. 324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. zhangheng@sdfmu.edu.cn.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, PO Box 100, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. lihongkaiyouxiang@163.com.; Healthcare Big Data Research Institute, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, PO Box 100, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. lihongkaiyouxiang@163.com.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, PO Box 100, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. xuefzh@sdu.edu.cn.; Healthcare Big Data Research Institute, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, PO Box 100, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. xuefzh@sdu.edu.cn.; Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, PO Box 100, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. xuefzh@sdu.edu.cn.","Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cohort Studies, Metabolic Syndrome, Proportional Hazards Models, Risk Factors, Smoking, Smoking Cessation, UK Biobank, United Kingdom","Cardiovascular disease, Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, Effect modification, Smoking cessation"
40312813,Effect of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) on Buprenorphine Prescribing for Opioid Use Disorder among Medicare Beneficiaries with Back Pain.,"Observational cohort study. To examine the effects of the Comprehensive Addition and Recovery Act (CARA) on buprenorphine prescribing and opioid use disorder (OUD) among Medicare beneficiaries with back pain. Enacted in January 2017, CARA extended buprenorphine prescribing authority to Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA) to treat OUD, defined as a physical or psychological dependence on opioids, but adoption varied by state. Leveraging this policy variation, we examined the effect of CARA on buprenorphine prescribing and OUD employing Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 with back pain from 2016 to 2019, and who were eligible for Part D prescription drug benefits. Only buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone combinations that are FDA-approved for OUD treatment were included as our outcome. A difference-in-difference regression examined the change in buprenorphine prescribing and OUD before and after CARA between states that did and did not expand prescription authority. Subgroup analysis examined treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and race/ethnicity. States that adopted a full scope-of-practice under CARA had a significant increase in buprenorphine prescribing (6.5%, 95%CI: 1.3%, 12.2%) and a reduction in OUD (7.2%, 95%CI: -9.3%, -4.8%) compared to states that did not expand prescribing authority after the policy implementation. States that expanded prescribing authority following CARA had a disproportionate increase in use of buprenorphine and a reduction in OUD among males and Hispanic patients compared to female and White patients. The magnitude of the policy effects increased over time across all groups. CARA was associated with increased buprenorphine prescribing and a reduction in OUD among older adults with back pain.

40312832,"Mediation of chronic pain and disability on opioid use disorder risk by pain management practices among adult Medicaid patients, 2016-2019.","We estimated the extent to which different pain management practices, considered together as well as individually, mediated the relationship between chronic pain or physical disability and new-onset opioid use disorder (OUD) in a large cohort of adult Medicaid patients. Considering the plausibility of the assumptions required to identify different mediational estimands, we estimated natural indirect effects when considering mediation through the group of mediators together and estimated interventional indirect effects when considering mediation through each pain management practice individually. We estimated each effect using a nonparametric one-step estimator. The pain management variables we examined mediated all of the total effect of chronic pain on OUD risk and nearly half of the total effect of physical disability on OUD risk. High-dose, long-duration opioid prescribing and co-prescription of opioids with benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and muscle relaxants each contributed substantially to the increased risk of OUD due to chronic pain (contributing to 10-37% of the overall effect) and more moderately to the increased risk of OUD due to physical disability (contributing to 3-19% of the overall effect). Antidepressant or anti-inflammatory prescribing and physical therapy generally did not contribute to increased OUD risk, and, in some cases, even contributed to small reductions in risk.",American journal of epidemiology,2025-05-01,10.1093/aje/kwaf093,Kara E Rudolph,Y Nina Gao,"Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Division of Biostatistics, Grossman School of Medicine, New York University.; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Care and Pain Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York University.; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Care and Pain Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York University.; Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Treatment Science, Rutgers Institute for Health, Rutgers University; Rutgers School of Public Health, Rutgers University.; Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University; New York State Psychiatric Institute; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.; Center for Health Services Research, Rutgers Institute for Health, Rutgers University; School of Social Work, Rutgers University.; Center for Opioid Epidemiology and Policy, Department of Population Health, Grossman School of Medicine, New York University.; Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University; New York State Psychiatric Institute.",N/A,"Chronic pain, causal mediation, mediation, opioid use disorder, overdose, pain management, physical disability"
40319407,Are Preoperative Corticosteroid Injections in Large or Intermediate Joints Associated with Surgical Site Infection After Soft Tissue Hand Surgery? A Retrospective Database Analysis.,"In this study, we asked the following question: Is intra-articular corticosteroid injection at a distant site prior to hand surgery associated with an increased risk of (1) surgical site infection, (2) reoperation for infection, or (3) wound dehiscence? Using a national administrative claims database, we identified adult patients undergoing carpal tunnel, trigger finger, or DeQuervain release. Patients were divided into four cohorts: intra-articular corticosteroid injection between 0 and 30, 31 and 60, or 61 and 90 days before surgery or no injection within 90 days prior to surgery. Large and intermediate joints were considered. We measured surgical site infection incidence, reoperation, and wound dehiscence within 90 days after surgery. We created multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between preoperative corticosteroid injection and each outcome, adjusting for age, sex, region, insurance plan, Elixhauser comorbidities, and history of tobacco use. Receiving a large-joint corticosteroid injection between 0 and 30, 31 and 60, or 61 and 90 days before surgery was not associated with surgical site infection or reoperation. Receiving a large-joint corticosteroid injection between 0 and 30 days before surgery was associated with a slightly higher incidence of wound dehiscence compared to no injection (0.5% vs 0.4%). Receiving an intermediate-joint corticosteroid injection between 0 and 30, 31 and 60, or 61 and 90 days before surgery was not associated with the incidence of surgical site infection, reoperation, or wound dehiscence. In patients with diabetes, receiving a corticosteroid injection within 90 days before surgery in a large or intermediate joint was not associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection, reoperation, or wound dehiscence. Corticosteroid injections into large- and intermediate-sized joints can be safely administered before hand surgery from a surgical site infection perspective, including in patients with diabetes.

40319789,Substance-induced mental disorders and discontinuation of medication for opioid use disorder.,"People with opioid use disorder (OUD) often exhibit psychiatric symptoms representing primary (PMD) and substance induced mental disorders (SIMD). PMD are associated with increased discontinuation of medications for OUD (MOUD). It is unknown if this relationship holds for SIMD. To examine the association between SIMD and time to MOUD discontinuation. In this retrospective cohort study using the Merative™ MarketScan® Commercial and Multi-State Medicaid insurance claims Databases (2015-2019), we identified individuals initiating MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone) following a 180-day pre-period of continuous enrollment without MOUD. Episodes were classified based on > 1 SIMD diagnosis in this pre-period. We estimated days to MOUD discontinuation using stepwise multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, insurance type (Medicaid or Commercial), Charlson Comorbidity Index, MOUD at initiation, co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD), and PMD. Of 31,134 MOUD initiation episodes, 3.5 % exhibited SIMD. Episodes with SIMD demonstrated a higher prevalence (p < .001 for all) of mood and psychotic disorders (42.8 vs 16.4 %; 4.0 % vs 0.7 % respectively) but lower prevalence of anxiety-related disorders (51.3 % vs 59.9 %) relative to episodes without SIMD. Unadjusted models illustrated a 44 % (95 %CI:1.34-1.55) increased hazard of MOUD discontinuation associated with SIMD. After adjusting for all covariates but PMD, SIMD retained a 13 % increased hazard of MOUD discontinuation (95 %CI:1.05-1.21). Adjusting for PMD eliminated this association. SIMD is associated with reduced time to MOUD discontinuation, which may be accounted for by PMD. Further research on SIMD treatment among individuals with OUD is needed to improve OUD treatment outcomes.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2025-07-01,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112685,Alyssa Shell Tilhou,Kevin Y Xu,"Department of Family Medicine, Dowling Building, Boston Medical Center, 850 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02118, USA.

40320496,Effect of chemotherapy on cancer specific mortality in female locally advanced urethral cancer.,"To quantify the effect of chemotherapy (CHT) in locally advanced female primary urethral cancer (fPUC). In the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Ends Results (SEER) database (2000-2021), we identified 295 fPUC patients with locally advanced stage treated with local therapy (surgery or radiation or both) with or without CHT. Multivariable Cox regression models addressed cancer specific mortality free survival (CSM). Sample power analyses were computed. Of 295 fPUC patients, 141 (48%) underwent CHT. CHT rates increased from 40 to 61% (Δ22%) over the study span (2000-2021). Five-year CSM rates of CHT exposed vs. CHT-naïve patients were 58 vs. 43% (Δ15%). In multivariable Cox regression models (age and histology adjusted) CHT independently predicted lower CSM (HR = 0.67, p = 0.027). In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) subgroup, CHT also independently predicted lower CSM (HR = 0.64, p = 0.01). In urothelial carcinoma (HR = 0.63, p = 0.2) and adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.7, p = 0.7) independent predictor status could not be demonstrated. Small sample sizes in urothelial carcinoma subgroup (UC) and adenocarcinoma subgroup (ADK) undermined the power of the analyses to as low as 48% in UC and 46% in ADK, respectively, versus ideal 80% power. In fPUC patients, CHT independently predicts lower CSM. This effect is generalizable to SCC patients. The same relationship between CHT status and CSM is also operational in UC and ADK subgroups, but limited power undermined confirmation of its' statistical significance.",World journal of urology,2025-05-04,10.1007/s00345-025-05545-0,Quynh Chi Le,Pierre I Karakiewicz,"Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada. d.le@med.uni-frankfurt.de.; Department of Urology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. d.le@med.uni-frankfurt.de.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Urology, AOU di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Urology, IEO European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Via Ripamonti 435, Milan, Italy.; Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Neurosciences, Science of Reproduction and Odontostomatology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.; Division of Experimental Oncology, Unit of Urology, URI, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Urology, University of Bologna, St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Division of Urology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Maggiore della Carità Hospital, Novara, Italy.; Division of Urology, Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Orbassano, Italy.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Urology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Department of Urology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.; Department of Urology, University of Bologna, St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Urology, AOU di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.; Department of Urology, AOU di Modena, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.; Department of Urology, IEO European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Via Ripamonti 435, Milan, Italy.; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.; Division of Experimental Oncology, Unit of Urology, URI, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.; Division of Urology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Maggiore della Carità Hospital, Novara, Italy.; Division of Urology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Maggiore della Carità Hospital, Novara, Italy.; Department of Urology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Department of Urology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Cancer Prognostics and Health Outcomes Unit, Division of Urology, University of Montréal Health Center, Montréal, Québec, Canada.","Humans, Female, Urethral Neoplasms, Middle Aged, Aged, Neoplasm Staging, SEER Program, Survival Rate, Retrospective Studies, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell","Cancer specific mortality, Chemotherapy, Females, Locally advanced urethral cancer"

Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2016-2020) were used. In-hospital complications, length-of-stay and hospitalisation charges were compared among patients undergoing HPB surgery. We identified 191,315 patients, of which 1705 (0.89 %) were cannabis consumers. Cannabis consumers were more likely to be male (67.5 % vs 50.2 %), younger, and Black (22.6 % vs 11.0); p < 0.001 for all. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly lower risk of pneumonia (OR 0.54, 95 % CI 0.29-0.99) among cannabis consumers.

40326723,Adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines at an academic family medicine practice.,"Opioid prescribing practices and guidelines are outlined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but limited data are currently available regarding their use in clinical practice. A primary care residency clinical site at an academic medical center attempted to improve compliance with the CDC best practices in 2022. As a quality improvement initiative, a policy was created, and education was provided to clinicians and patients. The clinical impact of these interventions was analyzed. A retrospective chart review was performed for patients on chronic opiates during 2023. Extracted electronic health record data were analyzed to collect information on the prescriber (resident/faculty/advanced practice provider), opioid type and duration, concurrent benzodiazepine use, and mental health diagnoses. The main outcomes were whether these patients had an opioid agreement and/or urine drug screen (UDS) in the past 12 months. A total of 245 patients met the criteria, with 29 percent also being prescribed benzodiazepines, and 69 percent having at least one mental health diagnosis. Forty-one percent of the patients had a UDS in the electronic medical record in 2023, with the statistically significant predictors being nontramadol opioid use and a completed opioid agreement. Thirty-two percent had a completed opioid agreement, with the statistically significant predictors being a concomitant mental health diagnosis, provider type, and UDS obtained. Despite policy and education, compliance with our primary outcomes remained low. Residents were the most compliant. Tramadol was also uniquely identified as having lower compliance with having a UDS on file. Next steps include continued education efforts on the risk and best practices for reducing opioid-related harms and structured chart reviews.",Journal of opioid management,2025,10.5055/jom.0931,Jennifer E Roper,Michelle K Keating,"Department of Family and Community Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database spanning from 2007 to 2018 were used, including 119,609 participants. After excluding individuals aged <18 years, those with incomplete follow-up data, and those missing critical variables such as CDAI and covariates, the final cohort consisted of 34,133 participants. Participants were categorized into a PD group (510 individuals) and a non-PD group (33,623 individuals). The CDAI values were calculated, and participants were divided into three groups based on the tertile distribution of their CDAI scores: Q1 (CDAI < -1.07), Q2 (-1.07 to 1.74), and Q3 (CDAI >1.74). Weighted logistic regression and weighted Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the associations between CDAI and the prevalence of PD, as well as between CDAI and all-cause mortality risk. Restricted cubic spline regression analysis was used to further elucidate the precise relationship between CDAI and outcome events. CDAI values were significantly lower in the PD group compared to the non-PD group. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbid conditions (hypertension and diabetes), blood lipid and glucose levels, a reduction in CDAI was associated with an increased risk of PD (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.72,  CDAI reduction is an independent risk factor for both PD risk in the general population and all-cause mortality in PD patients, with amplified predictive power in older adults, smokers, and hypertensive individuals.

40330996,Risk Factors and Outcomes Associated with Emergency Abdominal Surgery following Lower Extremity Total Joint Arthroplasty.,"This study aims to identify potential risk factors and assess postoperative outcomes associated with requiring emergency abdominal surgery (EAS) within 30 days following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesized that patients requiring EAS would carry a higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to patients that underwent the index operation alone. We conducted a retrospective analysis using TriNetX, examining data from 2016-2024 from patients over 18 years old who underwent THA/TKA and required EAS within 30 days. Postoperative outcomes, including mortality and hospital readmission, were compared between patients requiring EAS and those who did not. Statistical analyses included measures of association and chi-squared tests. Patient demographic data, including age, sex, and comorbidities were analyzed. Patients requiring EAS within 30 days of a joint arthroplasty were significantly more likely to be older, overweight or obese, and to be diagnosed with comorbidities including diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, alcohol use disorders, and tobacco use. These patients had significantly higher mortality rates within 60 days of joint arthroplasty compared to patients without EAS, suggesting that the second operation contributed significantly to the increase in adverse outcomes. This study emphasizes the importance of recognizing key risk factors for severe GI complications that require EAS. These findings highlight the need for careful patient selection, pre-operative evaluation of risk, and vigilant post-operative management, especially in those with many risk factors. Improved identification and management of high-risk patients may help reduce the likelihood of EAS and its associated mortality.",The archives of bone and joint surgery,2025,10.22038/ABJS.2024.82090.3743,Annie Lu,Sergio Huerta,N/A,N/A,"Arthroplasty, Emergency abdominal surgery, Mortality, Risk factors"

40341059,Trends in Prevalence and Correlates of Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnoses Among US Adult Cancer Survivors: Serial Cross-Sectional Analysis.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with cancer recurrence, new malignancies, and mortality among survivors of certain cancers. This study evaluated trends (2012-2021) in prevalence and correlates of AUD diagnoses among adult cancer survivors in the United States. This retrospective, serial cross-sectional study used claims data (2011-2021) from a national sample of US individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance. Adults diagnosed with malignant neoplasms who had at least 6 months of continuous health insurance enrollment prior to their cancer diagnosis were included. The primary outcome was a recent AUD diagnosis in each year of the study period identified from inpatient and outpatient records. We assessed AUD prevalence for each year among all cancer survivors and in specific subgroups. Using data from 2021, we compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between cancer survivors with and without AUD diagnoses and identified correlates of AUD diagnosis by using multivariable logistic regression. Of 5,956,137 eligible cancer survivors, 105,778 (1.78%) had received an AUD diagnosis. The annual prevalence of AUD diagnoses increased from 0.78% in 2012 to 1.43% in 2021 (P<.0001). AUD prevalence also increased in specific subgroups, including individuals with alcohol-related cancers (from 0.88% to 1.61%; P<.0001) and those receiving antineoplastic agents (from 0.97% to 1.60%; P<.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male sex, alcohol-related cancers, mental health diagnoses, and other substance use disorders were associated with at least 2 to 5 times greater odds of an AUD diagnosis. AUD diagnosis among US cancer survivors with private health insurance has increased over time, mirroring trends in the general population. Integrating AUD screening and treatment into cancer care may help mitigate the unique risks associated with alcohol use and misuse in cancer survivors.",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2025-05-01,10.6004/jnccn.2025.7007,Anton L V Avanceña,Michael Pignone,"Health Outcomes Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Department of Internal Medicine, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Health Outcomes Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Health Behavior Research and Training Institute, Steve Hicks School of Social Work, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Department of Population Health, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Department of Statistics and Data Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Now with Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, RI.; Pharmacotherapy and Translational Sciences Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX.; Pharmacotherapy Education and Research Center, Long School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX.; Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.; Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC.; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC.","Humans, Cancer Survivors, Male, Female, Cross-Sectional Studies, Prevalence, Middle Aged, United States, Adult, Retrospective Studies, Alcoholism, Neoplasms, Aged, Young Adult",N/A
40341919,Home Oxygen Safety in an Urban Population: A Multi-Pronged Approach.,"Home oxygen improves the survival of patients with severe chronic hypoxic lung disease, but is associated with an increased risk of burns, fires, and fatalities. There is minimal data about potential risk factors for fires and burns in an urban population discharged from the hospital to the community on oxygen. This is a 7-year retrospective chart review of patients discharged on oxygen to a Certified Home Health Agency. The highest-risk patients were defined as those believed by a nurse to be at imminent danger of causing a burn or fire and requiring review by an Emergency Committee; these are analyzed in more detail. A total of 1,301 patients were discharged on home oxygen. Twenty-six patients were identified as highest- risk and required emergency interventions. Risk factors for burns and fires included: 85% active smokers, 46% substance use disorder, 19 % unstable psychiatric disease or an unreliable caregiver. The primary care physician in the community was unaware that the patient had oxygen in the home in 35% of these cases. A Home Oxygen Safety Committee was convened to address improvements in the Electronic Health Record (EHR), hospital infrastructure, and patient and caregiver education to improve home oxygen safety. Burns and fires related to home oxygen are rare events but can be devastating to the patient, caregivers, and community. Establishing a regulatory requirement that oxygen be included on the medication list at hospital discharge, and in the ambulatory setting, has the potential to improve transitions of care for this vulnerable population.",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2025-05-04,10.1093/jbcr/iraf076,Wanda Horn,Amy R Ehrlich,"Division of Geriatrics, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Montefiore Home Care, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.; Patient Safety, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Preferred Home Care of New York, USA.; Department of Family and Social Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Division of Geriatrics, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.",N/A,"Burns, Cigarettes, Fires, Home oxygen"
40344682,Predictors of 30-day readmission among those treated with alcohol withdrawal in acute hospitals in England.,"To examine predictors of 30-day readmissions to acute hospitals in England for patients treated for alcohol withdrawal (AW). Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of routine hospital administrative data (i.e. Hospital Episode Statistics-Admitted Patient Care records) for adults admitted to non-specialist hospitals in England 2017-18. AW admissions were associated with digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and endocrine disorders and were of short duration (median 3 days). Of the 19 588 completed AW admissions examined in 2017-18, 3957 (20.2%) resulted in readmission within 30 days. The strongest predictors of 30-day readmission were being no fixed abode (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.81, 95%CI 1.44-2.26), prior discharge against medical advice (AOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.40-1.77), and greater Charlson comorbidity index total score (AOR 1.02, 95%CI 1.02-1.03). AW 30-day admissions are common and associated to complex case presentations that require high levels of community support on discharge. Hospital-based alcohol teams should prioritize strategies, which maximize medically managed AW, effective transitions to specialist community care including outreach teams and strong collaborations with physical and mental health outpatient services. Together with specialist initiatives within community mental health teams, assertive outreach, and homeless services 30-day readmissions may be minimized.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",2025-03-25,10.1093/alcalc/agaf022,Thomas Phillips,Simon Coulton,"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research (CAMHR), University of Hull, East Yorkshire, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, United Kingdom.; Alcohol Care Team, Department of Gastroenterology, Hull Royal Infirmary, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, East Yorkshire, Anlaby Road, Hull HU3 2JZ, United Kingdom.; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research (CAMHR), University of Hull, East Yorkshire, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, United Kingdom.; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research (CAMHR), University of Hull, East Yorkshire, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, United Kingdom.; Centre for Health Services Research, University of Kent, Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NF, United Kingdom.","Humans, Patient Readmission, Male, England, Female, Middle Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Retrospective Studies, Adult, Aged, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Alcoholism, Young Adult","acute hospitals, alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal, readmission"

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the US Collaborative Network on the TriNetX Analytics Platform. Adult patients with obesity (most recent value of BMI ≥ 30 kg/m Two years after surgery, patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery had a decreased risk of developing CRS, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.88). The risk remained lower at 5- and 10-year post-surgery, with a RR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86) and 0.73 (CI: 0.68-0.79), respectively. For patients with obesity and CRS, undergoing bariatric surgery resulted in fewer FESS at 2, 5, and 10 years after surgery, with a RR of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.35-0.79), 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42-0.76), and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38-0.67), respectively.

40346862,Malignant Transformation Rate of Oral Premalignant Disorders: A Large Database Analysis.,"Oral leukoplakia (OL), oral lichen planus (OLP), and oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) are precancerous lesions known to progress to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The transformation rates to OSCC are controversial and have been based on small, heterogeneous, single-institution studies. We present the largest study to date looking at the malignant transformation rates of these oral premalignant disorders (OPMD). We conducted a retrospective cohort study within the TriNetX database. Patients aged ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of OL, OLP, and OSF between 2008 and 2018 were included, allowing for up to 5 years of follow-up. The primary outcome was the 5-year rate of OSCC transformation compared to a control cohort. Secondary outcomes included treatment pathways and survival. Descriptive and comparative statistics were conducted using TriNetX software. Totally, 59,204 patients with diagnosed OL, OLP, or OSF were included. The average age of all included patients was 55.8 ± 14.1; the majority were female (n = 31,805, 53.7%) and white (n = 33,867, 57.2%). Rates of nicotine and alcohol dependence were 8.7% and 2.8%, respectively. The 5-year malignant transformation rates of OL, OLP, and OSF were 15.6%, 1.4%, and 18.6% (p < 0.01 compared to control), with an overall malignant transformation rate of 6.2% (p < 0.01 compared to control). The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 94.3%. Our results indicate the rates at which patients with OPMD (OL, OLP, and OSF) progress to OSCC are higher than previously reported. Transformation rates for OL and OSF in particular underscore the need for close monitoring and prompt treatment to avoid malignant transformation.

40347317,Impact of substance use disorders on critical care management and health outcomes in septic adolescents.,"Adult septic patients with substance abuse disorder (SUD) are at increased risk of poor outcomes, but the impact on adolescents is unknown. We aimed to determine if pre-existing SUD is associated with increased adverse outcomes and critical care resources in critically ill adolescents hospitalized with sepsis. We hypothesize that SUD is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes and usage of critical care resources in this adolescent patient population. This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing the TriNetX© electronic health record (EHR) database, which consists of EHR from participating healthcare organizations predominantly in the United States. Critically ill adolescents with sepsis aged 12-21 years were divided into two groups (SUD history and no-SUD history). Data related to demographics, diagnostic, procedural, and medication codes were analyzed. The primary outcomes were organ dysfunction, critical care therapies, and all-cause 1-year mortality. We included 5,436 critically ill adolescents with sepsis [730 (13.43%) SUD history and 4706 (86.57%) no-SUD history]. SUD history was associated with increased odds of organ dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-2.16; p < 0.001), vasoactive/inotropic drug usage (aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.10-1.52; p = 0.002), mechanical ventilation (aOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.85-2.59; p < 0.001), but not mortality (aOR 1.03; 95% CI 0.76-1.41; p = 0.83). Our retrospective analysis suggests history of SUD in critically ill septic adolescent patients is associated with increased utilization of critical care resources and organ dysfunction. Further study is needed to determine if substance abuse represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for critical illness in adolescent patients.",Annals of intensive care,2025-05-10,10.1186/s13613-025-01482-8,Havell Markus,Conrad Krawiec,"Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, P.O.

Patients aged ≥ 18 years with MIBC who had radical cystectomy from October 2012 to June 2018 were identified in the prospective COBLAnCE bladder cancer cohort. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. Patients were classified as MIBC-HR based on TNM staging. Disease-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 256 patients with MIBC-HR were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years and 204 patients were men (79.7%). 201 patients (78.5%) were current or former smokers. For staging, 226 patients were (y)pT3a or higher (88.3%) and 132 were N- (51.6%). Forty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.0%), and 69 received adjuvant chemotherapy (27.0%). Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy only, 59 received cisplatin-based therapy (86.8%). 182 patients (71.1%) constituted the ASO subgroup. 175 patients (68.3%) experienced an event up to the end of follow-up. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Median disease-free survival was 1.30 years [95%CI: 1.01-1.60] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 1.21 years [95%CI: 0.70-1.53] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. Median overall survival was 2.31 years [95%CI: 1.85-3.10] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 2.11 years [95%CI: 1.61-2.65] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. At 5 years, DFS was 27.4% [21.7;33.9%] in the MIBC-HR population and 23.7% [17.4;31.4] in the MIBC-HR-ASO population. OS at five years was 33.2% [27.1;40.0] for the MIBC-HR population and 29.6% [22.7;37.7] for the MIBC-HR-ASO population. Using real-world data, this study underscores the challenging prognosis of patients with MIBC-HR managed with RC, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy.

40357112,Cannabis Use During Pregnancy Correlates With Adverse Maternal Mental Health Outcomes: A Retrospective Study.,"Introduction The prevalence of cannabis use during pregnancy has risen alongside its legalization and perceived safety, often being used to alleviate pregnancy-related discomforts. However, cannabis use during pregnancy may have adverse implications for maternal mental health, including increased rates of depression, panic disorder, suicidal ideation, and alcohol abuse. This study aims to evaluate the association between cannabis use during pregnancy and these mental health outcomes. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX database, including over 2 million pregnant patients from 69 U.S. healthcare organizations (HCOs). A cohort of 51,087 cannabis users during pregnancy was compared to 1,936,508 non-users. Outcomes analyzed included depression, panic disorder, suicidal ideation, and alcohol abuse, identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Risk ratios, hazard ratios, and Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were calculated, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results Cannabis use during pregnancy was associated with higher incidences of all four mental health outcomes. Alcohol abuse showed the greatest relative risk (risk ratio = 13.57; hazard ratio = 12.44), followed by suicidal ideation (risk ratio = 10.67; hazard ratio = 9.81), panic disorder (risk ratio = 5.47; hazard ratio = 5.01), and depression (risk ratio = 2.66; hazard ratio = 3.50). Depression affected 29.7% of cannabis users, compared to 11.2% of non-users, with significant differences in survival probabilities (p < 0.001). Conclusion Cannabis use during pregnancy is significantly associated with increased risks of adverse mental health outcomes. These findings emphasize the importance of screening for cannabis use and mental health conditions during pregnancy and underscore the need for public health initiatives addressing the risks of prenatal cannabis use. Further research is needed to explore causal relationships and dosing effects.",Cureus,2025-04-01,10.7759/cureus.82146,Kypros J Dereschuk,Eduardo Espiridion,"Psychiatry, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.; Psychiatry, Tower Health Medical Group, West Reading, USA.",N/A,"adverse pregnancy outcome, alcohol misuse, cannabis use, maternal depression, maternal mental health, panic disorder (pd), suicidal ideation"
40359467,Initiation and Utilization of Psychotherapy in Women With Overactive Bladder.,"The incidence of and factors associated with psychotherapy use in women with overactive bladder are unknown. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of psychotherapy initiation after overactive bladder diagnosis in female Medicare beneficiaries and to analyze clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with initiation of psychotherapy within 3 years from overactive bladder (OAB) diagnosis. This was a retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed with OAB between the years 2011 and 2021 using the Medicare 5% Limited Data Set. International Classification of Diseases codes were used to identify women with OAB, and from that cohort, Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify incident use of psychotherapy within 5 years from OAB diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with the use of psychotherapy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with high (≥10 sessions) versus low (<10 sessions) utilization of psychotherapy. There were 374,918 women who met the inclusion criteria for OAB diagnosis; of these, 28,571 (8.7%) attended at least 1 psychotherapy session within 5 years. Factors associated with the increased use of psychotherapy included dual Medicaid/Medicare status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.26 [1.21, 1.31]), living in the Northeast (vs South) (aOR 1.26 [1.21, 1.31]), being diagnosed with anxiety or depression (aOR 5.14 [5.01, 5.26]), alcohol or drug abuse (aOR 1.66 [1.57, 1.75]), and increasing Charlson comorbidity score (aOR 1.03 [1.03, 1.04]). Psychotherapy use in older women with OAB is not rare. Demographic factors and psychiatric comorbidities affect the likelihood of psychotherapy use in this population.","Urogynecology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2025-05-13,10.1097/SPV.0000000000001696,Sarah E S Jeney,W Thomas Gregory,"From the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Urogynecology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill.; Urology Institute, Division of Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.",N/A,N/A

40370791,A statewide system for maternal-infant linked longitudinal surveillance: Indiana's model for improving maternal and child health.,"Indiana, located in the Midwest region of the United States, faces significant challenges with respect to health, especially maternal and child health (MCH). These challenges include high rates of stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and congenital syphilis (CS). Not only are these often-fatal conditions underreported, but it can also be difficult to track them longitudinally, as mothers and infants are not routinely linked through electronic health records (EHRs). This paper describes the process, structure and planned outcomes of a partnership between Indiana University, Regenstrief Institute and public health partners in support of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnant People-Infant Linked Longitudinal Surveillance (PILLARS) program. Together, academic, clinical and public health organisations are collaboratively developing an infrastructure and deploying novel methods to surveil stillbirth, CS and NAS longitudinally. The infrastructure includes: (a) deploying deterministic and probabilistic algorithms to link mothers and their infants using multiple, linked data sources; (b) creating and maintaining a registry of maternal-infant dyads; (c) using the registry to perform longitudinal surveillance in collaboration with Indiana public health authorities on stillbirth, NAS and CS and (d) translating information from surveillance activities into action by collaborating with public health and community-based organisations to improve and implement prevention activities in vulnerable Indiana communities. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for these conditions and other priority MCH outcomes by expanding our work to additional MCH use cases.",International journal of population data science,2024,10.23889/ijpds.v9i2.2395,Jill Inderstrodt,Brian E Dixon,"Department of Health Policy and Management, Indiana University Richard M.

40371673,Pharmacotherapy research landscape and knowledge gaps of opioids in maternal and pediatric populations.,"The use and misuse of opioids has surged in the past decade, with nearly half of the users being female. Although opioid use is lower among pregnant women, trends mirror the general population. While pediatric exposures largely occur through prescriptions. This review presents a novel landscape analysis of pharmacology knowledge gaps in opioids in the maternal and pediatric populations. We queried PubMed for studies on 27 opioids, focusing on pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacoepidemiology (PE) or clinical trials (CT) in maternal and pediatric populations. English-language publications were included, and data were synthesized to identify gaps. Additionally, MarketScan claims data and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels were analyzed to compare scientific evidence, opioid prescriptions/orders, and FDA recommendations. Morphine, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine are the most researched opioids in PK and PE/CT literature in both populations, but hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine are the most prescribed. Nine opioids lack FDA labels, and four of the 18 labeled drugs lack any human data. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine labels include lactation-focused PK information, with some pediatric clinical data for the latter two. Seven opioids lack PK and PE/CT studies in the maternal population, and PK research is absent for seven opioids, and PE/CT data is lacking for eight opioids in the pediatric population. PK studies often focus on labor, delivery, and lactation accompanied by neonatal data, whereas pregnancy research mainly occurs in PE studies. In pediatric populations, study types are evenly distributed among children, but PE studies focus more on adolescents. Drug concentration is the most reported parameter in PK studies, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a key outcome in both PK and PE studies. NOWS is also researched more using real-world data, whereas neurodevelopmental outcomes are often captured in prospective observational studies. There is substantial disparity between the most commonly researched and prescribed opioids. In particular, the opioid pharmacology knowledge gaps are larger in pregnant women and for the highly prescribed opioids hydrocodone and oxycodone. The limited human data in FDA labels underscores the need for additional studies. Studies using real-world data can potentially help address these gaps.",Pharmacotherapy,2025-06-01,10.1002/phar.70024,Aditi Shendre,Lang Li,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Moderna, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Practice, Purdue University College of Pharmacy, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Division of Pharmacoepidemiology, Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, IUSM, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.","Humans, Analgesics, Opioid, Pregnancy, Female, Child, United States, Pharmacoepidemiology, United States Food and Drug Administration, Drug Labeling, Opioid-Related Disorders","biomedical literature, drug labeling, knowledge gaps, maternal, opiates, opioids, pediatric"
40376191,Comparison of Outcomes of Percutaneous Mechanical Aspiration vs Tricuspid Valve Surgery in Drug Use-Associated Endocarditis of the Tricuspid Valve.,"People who inject drugs (PWID) and present with infective endocarditis (IE) of the tricuspid valve may need valve surgery due to persistent infection, heart failure, or embolic risk. Vacuum-assisted percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) has been proposed as a potential option for those who cannot undergo surgery. We queried TriNetX, a database that provides access to electronic medical record data across health care organizations, to identify PWID who had tricuspid valve IE and underwent PMA between 2016 and 2024, using diagnostic and procedure codes. Short-term procedural and clinical outcomes were compared with PWID who underwent tricuspid valve surgery. In total, 129 patients underwent the PMA procedure and 952 had valve surgery. A higher proportion of the PMA cohort was female (66% vs 57%) and of non-White race (32% vs 22.5%). At 1 month postprocedure, the surgical group had a lower rate of death (2.5% vs 7.9%,  Short-term outcomes seem comparable between PMA and tricuspid valve surgery in tricuspid valve IE in PWID.

40378100,Identifying opioid agonist treatment prescriber networks from health administrative data: A validation study.,"Given the growth of collaborative care strategies for people with opioid use disorder and the changing composition of the illicit drug supply, there is a need to identify and analyze clinic-level outcomes for centers prescribing opioid agonist treatment (OAT). We aimed to determine and validate whether prescriber networks, constructed with administrative data, can successfully identify distinct clinical practice facilities in Ontario, Canada. We executed a retrospective population-based cohort study using OAT prescription records from the Canadian Addiction Treatment Centres in Ontario, Canada between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2020. Social network analysis was utilized to create networks with connections between physicians based on their shared OAT clients. We defined connections two different ways, by including the number of clients shared or a relative threshold on the percentage of shared OAT clients per physician. Clinics were identified using modularity maximization, with sensitivity analyses applying Louvain, Walktrap, and Label Propagation algorithms. Concordance between network-identified facilities and the (gold standard) de-identified facility-level IDs was assessed using overall, positive and negative agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). From 144 physicians at 105 clinics with 32,842 OAT clients, we assessed 250 different versions of the created networks. The three different detection algorithms had wide variation in concordance, with ranges on sensitivity from 0.02 to 0.88 and PPV from 0.06 to 0.97. The optimal result, derived from the modularity maximization method, achieved high specificity (0.98, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98) and NPV (0.98, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98) and moderate PPV (0.54, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.57) and sensitivity (0.45, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.47). This scenario had an overall agreement of 0.96, negative agreement of 0.98, and positive agreement of 0.49. Social network analysis can be used to identify clinics prescribing OAT in the absence of clinic-level identifiers, thus facilitating construction and comparison of clinic-level caseloads and treatment outcomes.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0322064,Megan Kurz,Bohdan Nosyk,"Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.; Health Sciences North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; ICES North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Health Sciences North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; ICES North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Northern Ontario School of Medicine University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; BC Cancer Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Health Sciences North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; ICES North, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Northern Ontario School of Medicine University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.","Humans, Retrospective Studies, Ontario, Opioid-Related Disorders, Analgesics, Opioid, Female, Male, Drug Prescriptions",N/A

40395080,Understanding Risk Factors for Physical Assault in a Large Inpatient Behavioral Health System.,"To enhance understanding of the risk for violence in inpatient psychiatric environments, the authors studied assaultive behavior in a large health care system to explore the demographic, clinical, and other factors associated with the likelihood of patients' committing a physical assault. In this retrospective chart review study, 3 years of data were collected from a single-state health care system spanning >330 inpatient psychiatric beds across six separate hospitals. The system's risk management database was queried for all physical assaults during the study period (2021-2023), and these assaults were cross-matched with patients' electronic medical record data. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted to investigate differences between patients who had committed an assault during the study period and those who had not. A total of 15,186 unique inpatients were evaluated, and 556 physical assaults committed by 359 (2.4%) patients during the study period were identified. Patients who committed an assault were significantly more likely to be male, be younger, identify as Black or African American, have a psychotic disorder, be subject to conservatorship, have been admitted involuntarily, and have a known history of assault. Patients with a comorbid substance use disorder were significantly less likely to engage in assault. This study represents one of the largest investigations into rates of assault by patients in U.S. inpatient psychiatric hospitals. By attaining a greater understanding of risk factors for inpatient assault, this study may contribute to the development of risk assessment and management methodologies.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",2025-05-21,10.1176/appi.ps.20250075,Tobias Wasser,Caren Teitelbaum,"Department of Psychiatry, Frank H.

The TriNetX Global Collaborative Network was queried for patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from 2005 to 2024. Patients taking GLP-1 agonists within 1 year of surgery were matched to patients without. Cohort matching was done according to race, sex, body mass index nicotine dependence, hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate A total of 9,400 TKA procedures and 4,488 THA procedures constituted evenly divided cohorts. Outcomes included infection, revision surgery, and periprosthetic fractures at 3 months and 1 year. Bonferroni correction applied with threshold P < 0.0041. TKA: periprosthetic infection following TKA was lower in the GLP-1 group compared with the non-GLP-1 group at both 3 months (0.94% vs. 1.45%; P < 0.001) and 1-year (1.21% vs. 2.04%; P < 0.001). Rates of periprosthetic fracture following TKA were higher albeit not markedly in patients prescribed GLP-1 agonists versus patients not receiving GLP-1 agonists at 3-months (0.47% vs. 0.21%; P = 0.034, respectively) and at 1-year (0.70% vs. 0.34%; P = 0.015) postoperatively.

This study aimed to examine substance use patterns in child welfare cases from 2019 to 2022. Female parents assessed for child abuse or neglect using administrative data from the Ohio Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Ohio SACWIS). Substance types were recorded during the family assessment at case entry. A retrospective observational study was conducted to compare substance involvement before, during, and after the onset of the pandemic. Single changepoint analyses identified significant shifts in the mean percentage of cases involving substance use overall and for specific substances during selected weeks of each year. Among 264,380 women investigated, 65,796 (24.9 %) were involved with substance use. In 2020, the percentage of cases involving substance use peaked in the second quarter, driven by polysubstance and cannabis use. Changepoint analyses confirmed these changes. Only in 2020 did substance use cases significantly increase (32.4 % to 41.8 %) in week 10, coinciding with the national emergency declaration. Similar increases were observed for polysubstance and cannabis use. The rise in substance-involved cases early in the pandemic corroborates national trends, with cannabis use notably driving this change, suggesting that parents may have used substances to cope. The high prevalence of polysubstance use highlights the need for targeted treatment programs and policy interventions for parental substance use.",Child abuse & neglect,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.chiabu.2025.107487,Yun Ye,Bridget Freisthler,"The Ohio State University, College of Social Work, 1947 College Road N., Columbus, OH 43210, United States of America.

The aim of this study was to assess antidepressant adherence rates and identify factors associated with non-adherence in a population-based cohort of patients with depressive disorders, using real-world data. This retrospective, population-based cohort study used real-world data from patients diagnosed with depression in the Canary Islands, Spain, between 2013 and 2021. Adherence to antidepressants was assessed using the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) over a 12-month follow-up period. Patients were classified as adherent if they had an MPR ≥ 0.8. To assess the association with sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, multivariate logistic regression models were performed. Among the 39,800 patients included, the overall adherence rate to antidepressants was 31.02 %. Older age, female sex, and the presence of multiple comorbidities were significantly associated with higher adherence rates. In contrast, alcohol, and tobacco use, as well as inadequate nutrition, were significantly linked with lower adherence.

40401763,Anxiety but not Depression Is Associated With Increased Health Care Utilization Following Lumbar Fusion.,"Observational cohort study. The purpose of this study is to describe the association between 3 prevalent mental health comorbidities and 1-year health care utilization after lumbar fusion surgery. The volume of lumbar fusion procedures in the United States is increasing, leading to a substantial postoperative health care burden. Postoperative costs associated with these procedures may be driven by a number of factors, including patient comorbidities. A large national commercial claims database (MarketScan, Merative) was analyzed. Patients who underwent a single-level lumbar fusion from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, were included in the study. Patients were categorized based on the presence of a prior diagnosis of opioid dependence, anxiety, or depression. The main outcome was the total cost for postoperative interventions in the 1-year period after lumbar fusion. Interventions examined in this study included: (i) physical therapy, (ii) injections, (iii) pain medication, (iv) imaging, (v) clinic visits, and (vi) subsequent spine surgeries. The study population included 4245 patients (anxiety, 19.2%; depression; 19.2%; opioid dependence, 2.6%). The average total 1-year postoperative cost per patient was $8641 ± 19,661. Higher-cost patients were more likely to be those with a prior diagnosis of anxiety (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.69, P<0.001) or opioid dependence (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.23-2.69, P<0.01). Anxiety was found to be associated with the largest relative increases in total costs compared with patients without this diagnosis (+$2,272, P=0.003). The cost of pain medication was 4.2 times higher (P<0.001) among patients with a prior diagnosis of opioid dependence. Patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion have varying levels of health care utilization, with a prior diagnosis of anxiety likely to drive higher costs.",Clinical spine surgery,2025-05-22,10.1097/BSD.0000000000001783,Darren Z Nin,David H Kim,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Tufts University School of Medicine.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Neurosurgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New England Baptist Hospital.; Tufts University School of Medicine.",N/A,"comorbidities, costs, health care utilization, mental health"

Of 716 referrals, 517 individuals (mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.1] years; 295 [57.1%] male) enrolled; including 14 American Indian or Alaskan Native individuals (2.7%), 7 Asian individuals (1.4%), 67 Black individuals (13.0%), 22 Hispanic individuals (4.3%), 6 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander individuals (1.2%), and 308 White individuals (59.6%); 513 individuals (99.2%) spoke English. Participants had substantial housing needs, with rent (383 individuals [74.1%]) and utility (282 individuals [54.5%]) support being the most frequently reported needs and used services. The mean (SD) cost per member per month was $2225 ($1586). Frequently reported nonhousing needs included employment (154 individuals [42.3%]), food (152 individuals [41.8%]), mental health (94 individuals [25.8%]), and transportation (86 individuals [23.6%]). The findings of this cohort study provide critical insights into the types of services needed and associated costs for supporting housing as a Medicaid benefit. Significant needs were observed, emphasizing the necessity of cross-sector collaboration and clear role definitions between health care and housing organizations. The findings offer valuable lessons for the design and implementation of housing support programs under Medicaid; these insights are crucial as Oregon and other states consider similar initiatives to address housing as a health-related social need.",JAMA network open,2025-05-01,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.12405,Monique Gill,Catherine J Livingston,"Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Health Share of Oregon, Portland.; Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Center for Outcomes Research and Education, Portland, Oregon.; Health Share of Oregon, Portland.; Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.","Humans, United States, Medicaid, Male, Female, Pilot Projects, Adult, Middle Aged, Housing, Ill-Housed Persons, Oregon, Cohort Studies",N/A
40406079,Socioeconomic differences in discharge against medical advice and hospital admission among emergency department visits associated with substance use in the United States.,"Discharge against medical advice (DAMA) and inpatient admission (IA) among emergency department (ED) visits are two important outcomes in hospital utilization, while the first one has been mainly considered a negative outcome. This study aimed to examine the association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA among ED visits with substance use (age 12-64 years) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study retrospectively analyzed the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2019 to 2020. The International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify opioid, cannabis, and alcohol use, and smoking. The pandemic was significantly associated with higher odds of IA (OR 1.04, CI 1.02-1.06). Female gender and rural hospitals were adversely associated with both DAMA and IA, but lower household incomes were positively and negatively associated with DAMA and IA, respectively. Race and health insurance were partly differently associated with these outcomes. Asian patients exhibited significantly lower odds (OR 0.82, CI 0.71-0.88) regarding DAMA. Black (OR 0.79, CI 0.78-0.80) and Native American patients (OR 0.87, CI 0.82-0.90) exhibited lower odds, and Hispanic (OR 1.05, CI 1.03-1.06) and Asian patients (OR 1.40, CI 1.33-1.44) had higher odds compared to White patients in terms of AI. Except for self-pay, which was associated with lower odds of IA, Medicaid, self-pay, and free care were significantly associated with higher odds of DAMA and IA. Our results also showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the association of health insurance with IA, but not with DAMA. These findings highlight the complex association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA. By addressing these differences within the hospital setting, providers can mitigate the negative consequences of substance use on patient health and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.",Frontiers in public health,2025,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1431384,Zahra Mojtahedi,Jay J Shen,"Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Research Core Capacity, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, United States.; Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Department of Healthcare Administration, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Healthcare Administration and Policy, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.; Center for Health Disparities Research, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, United States.","Humans, Emergency Service, Hospital, Adult, United States, Female, Male, Middle Aged, Adolescent, Substance-Related Disorders, Retrospective Studies, Socioeconomic Factors, Patient Discharge, COVID-19, Young Adult, Child, Hospitalization, Emergency Room Visits","discharge against medical advice, disparity, emergency department, inpatient admission, public health"
40406152,Serum sodium within the normal range and its U-shaped relationship with biological aging in U.S. adults.,"This cross-sectional study evaluated the correlation between serum sodium levels (135-145 mmol/L) and biological aging in U.S. adults. Biological age, derived from multi-system biomarkers, provides a more accurate assessment of aging than chronological age. Hydration balance, reflected by serum sodium, may modulate age-related diseases and mortality, but its link to biological aging remains underexplored. Using NHANES data (1999-2018), we focused on normonatremic adults (≥20 years). The final cohort included 18,301 participants. Biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method, and ∆age (biological age-chronological age) was calculated. Associations were assessed using multivariate regression, generalized additive models, and threshold analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for variations across different populations. Nonlinear analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between serum sodium and biological age. The lowest biological age occurred at 139.3 mmol/L: each 1 mmol/L increase below this threshold was associated with a reduction of 0.10 years in biological age (95% CI: -0.15, -0.05), whereas values above it showed a 0.08-year increase (95% CI: 0.04, 0.13). For ∆age, a negative association was observed below 141.2 mmol/L, with each increase linked to a 0.07-year decrease (95% CI: -0.10, -0.04). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions in diabetic and smoking populations. Maintaining serum sodium levels within an optimal range (138-142 mmol/L) may help delay biological aging. Hydration management may serve as a modifiable factor for healthy aging, particularly in high-risk groups such as individuals with diabetes or tobacco use.",Frontiers in nutrition,2025,10.3389/fnut.2025.1589962,Xianxiang Tong,Mengxue Liu,"Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",N/A,"aging, biological age, hydration, hydration management, serum sodium"
40406410,Association between geriatric nutritional risk index and osteoarthritis in aged person over 60: data from NHANES 2005-2018.,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent age-related degenerative joint disorder, demonstrates significant associations with nutritional status. This study examines the prognostic value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in OA risk stratification among elderly individuals. This retrospective analysis utilized seven NHANES cycles (2005-2018) encompassing geriatric participants (≥ 60 years) possessing complete GNRI measurements and baseline covariates. For comparative cohort balancing, propensity score matching was executed using inverse probability weighting a matched-pairs design, adjusting for age, alcohol consumption, and the Poverty Income Ratio. Multivariable-adjusted weighted logistic regression quantified GNRI-OA associations, with restricted cubic splines (RCS) characterizing nonlinear dynamics. Subgroup analyses were also performed. This cross-sectional analysis identified 656 OA cases among 3,120 rigorously screened geriatric participants. Elevated GNRI levels demonstrated a significant association with increased OA risk among geriatric populations, with the correlation remaining robust in sensitivity analyses adjusted for metabolic confounders. Specifically, a GNRI ≥ 123.63 was associated with a higher probability of OA in this population. RCS analysis revealed a significant non-linear relationship (p_non-linear < 0.001) between GNRI and OA risk, particularly among men and non-smokers. Subgroup analyses indicated that males, Hispanic Americans, Non-Hispanic Black people, non-smokers, and those with a low PIR were more sensitive to changes in GNRI. Elevated GNRI was independently associated with OA prevalence in geriatric populations, demonstrating nutritional status's pivotal role in degenerative joint pathophysiology. The impact of GNRI on OA risk may differ across demographic subgroups, highlighting the need for personalized approaches in managing OA risk based on nutritional status.",Frontiers in medicine,2025,10.3389/fmed.2025.1579095,Hongxu Lu,Baoleri Xilin,"Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.; Department of Orthopedic, International Mongolia Hospital of Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, China.",N/A,"NHANES, elderly, geriatric nutritional risk index, osteoarthritis, risk factors"
40409187,Investigating the associations of blood lead and cadmium with smoking-related DNA methylation and mortality among U.S. adults.,"Lead and cadmium have been linked to alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) and increased mortality. However, the role of smoking-related DNAm in the link between these heavy metals and mortality remains unclear. We analyzed data from 2110 participants aged 50 and older from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), linked to mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with follow-up through 2019. Our study examined the associations between blood lead and cadmium levels, DNA methylation-predicted pack years of smoking (DNAmPackYrs), and mortality outcomes. Our analysis found that higher natural logarithm (Ln)-transformed lead and cadmium levels were positively associated with ln-DNAmPackYrs, with a percent change of 11.34 % (P = 0.001) for lead and 35.57 % (P < 0.001) for cadmium. Participants with both heavy metals above the 50th percentile had the highest DNAmPackYrs, with P for trend < 0.001. Weighted Cox regression analysis demonstrated both ln-lead and ln-DNAmPackYrs were linked to an elevated risk of all mortality outcomes, while ln-cadmium specifically predicted all-cause mortality. A significant interaction between lead and cadmium in relation to all-cause mortality was observed (P for interaction = 0.036). Additionally, significant interactions between DNAmPackYrs and both heavy metals were found in relation to all-cause mortality (P for interaction = 0.001 for lead; P for interaction = 0.013 for cadmium). Drawing from a nationally representative cohort of older U.S. adults, this study provides robust evidence linking blood lead and cadmium levels to smoking-related DNAm and increased mortality risk. Moreover, the analysis revealed additive effects of these metals on smoking-related DNAm, as well as synergistic impacts on all-cause mortality. Additionally, smoking-induced DNAm may play a role in mediating the connection between heavy metal exposure and mortality risk. Additional research is required to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these associations.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025-07-01,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118360,Yu-Wei Fang,Chien-Yu Lin,"Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shin-Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei 111, Taiwan; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei 242, Taiwan.; Department of Cardiology, National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, Yunlin 640, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Institute of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, Taichung 435, Taiwan.; Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Shin-Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei 111, Taiwan; Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan; Department of Internal Medicine, En Chu Kong Hospital, Taipei 237, Taiwan.

40413965,Receipt of addiction treatment after nonfatal opioid overdose and risk of subsequent overdose: A retrospective cohort study.,"Opioid overdose survivors are at high risk for subsequent overdose. There are few evaluations using real-world data to compare overdose risk after receipt of different addiction treatment modalities. To assess the association between receipt of different addiction treatment modalities and risk of subsequent opioid overdose among opioid overdose survivors. Survival analysis comparing time-to-subsequent overdose within a cohort of opioid overdose survivors using a linked state-wide individual level data of different addiction treatment modalities: opioid agonists treatments (OAT, i.e., methadone or buprenorphine) and non-medication based inpatient addiction treatments (medically supervised opioid withdrawal and extended inpatient treatment). Opioid-involved overdose survivors (N = 4089) admitted to a hospital or emergency department in Connecticut between May 2016 and December 2017 MAIN MEASURES: Time-to-subsequent overdose (fatal or non-fatal) and time-to-subsequent fatal overdose KEY RESULTS: Following the index overdose, 467 (11.4 %) experienced another overdose event within 12 months (87 fatal and 380 non-fatal), 35 % received OAT (25 % buprenorphine and 13 % methadone), and 21 % received inpatient addiction treatment (19 % medically supervised opioid withdrawal and 8 % extended inpatient treatment). In survival analyses adjusted for demographics, incarceration, and receipt of non-OAT opioids or benzodiazepines, receipt of methadone (aHR 0.41, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.66) or buprenorphine (aHR 0.72, 95 % CI: 0.53-0.98) was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent overdose compared to no receipt of methadone or buprenorphine, respectively. Neither medically supervised opioid withdrawal (aHR 1.08, 95 % CI: 0.77-1.50) nor extended inpatient treatment (aHR 0.90, 95 % CI: 0.53-1.54) was associated with reduced risk of subsequent overdose. Neither OAT nor non-medication based inpatient treatment modalities were associated with a change in risk of subsequent fatal overdose; benzodiazepine exposure was associated with increased risk (aHR 2.65, 95 % CI: 1.66-4.23). Using statewide data, our findings underscore the importance of OAT to reduce risk of subsequent overdose following a non-fatal opioid overdose.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2025-08-01,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112679,Benjamin A Howell,William C Becker,"Section of General Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States; Program in Addiction Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.

40415419,"Identifying key risk factors for intentional self-harm, including suicide, among a cohort of people prescribed opioid agonist treatment: A predictive modelling study.","People with opioid use disorder are at increased risk of intentional self-harm and suicide. Although risk factors are well known, most tools for identifying individuals at highest risk of these behaviours have limited clinical value. We aimed to develop and internally validate models to predict intentional self-harm and suicide risk among people who have been in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Retrospective observational cohort study using linked administrative data. New South Wales, Australia. 46 330 people prescribed OAT between January 2005 and November 2017. Intentional self-harm and suicide prediction within a 30-day window using linked population datasets for OAT, hospitalisation, mental health care, incarceration and mortality. Machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and gradient boosting, assessed over 80 factors during the last 3, 6 and 12 months. Feature visualisation using SHapley Additive exPlanations. Gradient boosting identified 30 important factors in predicting self-harm and/or suicide. These included the most recent frequency of emergency department presentations; hospital admissions involving mental disorders such as borderline personality, substance dependence, psychosis and depression/anxiety; and recent release from incarceration. The best fitting model had a Gini coefficient of 0.65 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82] and was applied to 2017 data to estimate the probability of self-harm and/or suicide. On average 46 people (0.16%) (from a total of 28 000 people in OAT) experienced intentional self-harm or suicide per month. Applying a 0.15% probability threshold, approximately 5167 people were classified as high risk, identifying 69% of all self-harm or suicide cases per month. This figure reduced to 450 per month after excluding people already identified in the previous month. Among people in opioid agonist treatment, administrative linked data can be used with advanced machine learning algorithms to predict self-harm and/or suicide in a 30-day prediction window.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2025-05-25,10.1111/add.70095,Nicola R Jones,Louisa Degenhardt,"National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; SydneyMSK Research Flagship Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Monash Addiction Research Centre, Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Department of Family Medicine and Emergency Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.",N/A,"data linkage, machine learning, opioid‐related disorders, self‐harm, suicide & feature analysis"
40418717,Impact of Preexisting Substance Use Disorders on Prolonged Opioid Use and Postoperative Complications After Burns.,"Previous studies have linked preexisting substance use disorders to adverse postoperative outcomes in burn patients, yet their impact on opioid use remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study compares the effects of various substances on opioid use after burns and aims to analyze the risks and whether they differ among substances. The TriNetX database was queried for burn patients aged 18 years and older with preexisting alcohol, cannabis, or tobacco use disorders, who were placed in their respective cohorts. These patients were matched to a non-substance use disorder cohort using propensity score matching based on demographics, mental health, pain syndromes, and burn severity. The measured outcomes assessed were opioid use, wound infection, wound disruption, and postprocedural pain. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 3 months and 12 months post-burn. After matching, patients with preexisting substance use disorders had significantly higher risk ratios for prolonged opioid use, wound infections, and wound healing disruptions at both 3- and 12-months compared to matched patient control cohorts. Additionally, all patient cohorts also exhibited increased risk of postprocedural pain. Burn patients with preexisting substance use disorders face a significantly higher risk of prolonged opioid use and postoperative complications at both 3- and 12-month post-burn injury. The alcohol cohort patients were associated with the greatest increase in opioid use and postoperative complications, while the tobacco patient cohort presented with the highest wound disruption rates at 3- and 12-months post-burn.",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2025-05-26,10.1093/jbcr/iraf098,Philong Nguyen,Juquan Song,"John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Indiana University School of Medicine, 340 W 10th St, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, Texas 75390, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; John Sealy School of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.; Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, Texas 77555, United States.",N/A,"Burn Injuries, Opioid Dependence, Postoperative Complications, Substance Use Disorder"

This study was a retrospective claims analysis with a nested case-control design utilizing data from the Merative™ MarketScan®, Commercial, and Medicare Supplemental databases. Adults aged 18 to 80 years with ≥1 AUD remission diagnosis and a subsequent insomnia diagnosis were included. In patients with AUD who were in remission and had a subsequent insomnia diagnosis, the odds of return to alcohol use were compared between those who received pharmacotherapeutic intervention for insomnia and those who did not receive such treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. Among the 6,002 patients who met the inclusion criteria within the Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases, the adjusted OR comparing odds of return to alcohol use in patients who received treatment for insomnia compared to those who did not was 0.81 (95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.69, 0.96;  These data suggest that patients with AUD who are in remission and have insomnia experience a lower odds of return to alcohol use following pharmacotherapy for insomnia compared with patients who did not receive pharmacotherapy, underscoring the importance of identifying insomnia and carefully considering the risk-benefit of treatment interventions, including pharmacologic approaches where appropriate, to decrease the risk of return to alcohol use.",Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,2025-05-27,10.15288/jsad.24-00354,Jaromir Mikl,Valentine Pascale,"Purdue Pharma L.P., 201 Tresser Blvd., Stamford, CT, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Genesis Research Group, 111 River St., Hoboken, NJ, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.; Purdue Pharma L.P., 201 Tresser Blvd., Stamford, CT, USA.",N/A,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD), cessation, insomnia, outcome measures, return to alcohol use, sleep disorder"
40435106,The UK Biobank mental health enhancement 2022: Methods and results.,"This paper introduces the UK Biobank (UKB) second mental health questionnaire (MHQ2), describes its design, the respondents and some notable findings. UKB is a large cohort study with over 500,000 volunteer participants aged 40-69 years when recruited in 2006-2010. It is an important resource of extensive health, genetic and biomarker data. Enhancements to UKB enrich the data available. MHQ2 is an enhancement designed to enable and facilitate research with psychosocial and mental health aspects. UKB sent participants a link to MHQ2 by email in October-November 2022. The MHQ2 was designed by a multi-institutional consortium to build on MHQ1. It characterises lifetime depression further, adds data on panic disorder and eating disorders, repeats 'current' mental health measures and updates information about social circumstances. It includes established measures, such as the PHQ-9 for current depression and CIDI-SF for lifetime panic, as well as bespoke questions. Algorithms and R code were developed to facilitate analysis. At the time of analysis, MHQ2 results were available for 169,253 UKB participants, of whom 111,275 had also completed the earlier MHQ1. Characteristics of respondents and the whole UKB cohort are compared. The major phenotypes are lifetime: depression (18%); panic disorder (4.0%); a specific eating disorder (2.8%); and bipolar affective disorder I (0.4%). All mental disorders are found less with older age and also seem to be related to selected social factors. In those participants who answered both MHQ1 (2016) and MHQ2 (2022), current mental health measure showed that fewer respondents have harmful alcohol use than in 2016 (relative risk 0.84), but current depression (RR 1.07) and anxiety (RR 0.98) have not fallen, as might have been expected given the relationship with age. We also compare lifetime concepts for test-retest reliability. There are some drawbacks to UKB due to its lack of population representativeness, but where the research question does not depend on this, it offers exceptional resources that any researcher can apply to access. This paper has just scratched the surface of the results from MHQ2 and how this can be combined with other tranches of UKB data, but we predict it will enable many future discoveries about mental health and health in general.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0324189,Katrina A S Davis,Matthew Hotopf,"King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.; ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Helmholtz Munich, Neuherberg, Germany.; Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.; King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Copenhagen University Hospital - Mental Health Services CPH, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Mental Health Center Sct.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK Biobank. 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Detailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. We tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter brain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT user status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of administration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the effects of a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users and examined associations by APOE ε4 status. Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter brain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes compared to never-users.

40440488,Risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with hepatitis C virus in pregnancy.,"To evaluate maternal sociodemographic factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during pregnancy in a large population of live births. Retrospective analysis of the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Natality Live Birth database (2016-2021). All births were eligible for inclusion. Deliveries with missing data on HCV infection were excluded. Multiple sociodemographic factors and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were compared between pregnancies complicated by maternal HCV infection and those without HCV. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with HCV and adjust outcomes for potential confounders. Of the 22,604,938 live births included, 107,761 (0.48 %) were complicated by maternal HCV. Patients with HCV in pregnancy were more likely to be advanced maternal age, have Medicaid insurance, or smokers. In addition, HCV in pregnancy was associated with higher risks of concurrent infections with hepatitis B virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia. HCV was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth <37 weeks, low birthweight, congenital anomalies at birth, low 5-min Apgar scores, NICU admission, antibiotic treatment for suspected neonatal sepsis, as well as immediate and prolonged ventilation. Based on this recent, large US population cohort, HCV in pregnancy is more commonly associated with certain sociodemographic factors and several adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. These data are an important step in the attempt to identify at-risk patients and employ strategies to better manage and optimize care for these pregnancies.",Journal of perinatal medicine,2025-05-28,10.1515/jpm-2025-0146,Moti Gulersen,Eran Bornstein,"Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 6529 Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Biostatistics and Data Management, New York University Rory Meyers College of Nursing, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lenox Hill Hospital - Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, New York, NY, USA.",N/A,"HCV, infectious disease, maternal morbidity, neonatal morbidity, preterm birth, sexually transmitted infection"
40441405,Non-Tobacco Nicotine Dependence is Associated with Increased Postoperative Pain and Opioid Requirement Following Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair.,"The increasing prevalence of non-tobacco nicotine dependence (NTND) related to vaping has raised concerns about its potential impact on rotator cuff disease especially given the pain after repair. This study aims to compare the risk of various surgical outcomes in patients with NTND, as compared to a control group without NTND. A retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database examined patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated arthroscopically from 2004 to 2021. A NTND patient cohort was compared to a non-NTND cohort. Patients were 1:1 propensity matched, controlling for demographics and comorbidities. 90-day outcomes measured included postoperative infection, pain, shoulder stiffness, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, mononeuropathy, physical therapy, hospital admissions, and emergency visits. 3-year outcomes measured included opioid abuse, shoulder pain, revision surgery, arthrocentesis/injection, and shoulder arthroplasty. Relative risks (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were calculated to assess the association between NTND and these surgical outcomes. 1,572 patients were included in each group. At 90 days postoperative, the NTND cohort had a significantly higher risk of opioid use with an RR of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.46, p < 0.001), and emergency department visits with an RR of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.02, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference observed between groups in acute postoperative pain (RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.07, p = 0.041), postoperative shoulder stiffness (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.42, p = 0.628) and orthopedic aftercare (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.17, p = 0.925). At 3 years postoperative, the NTND cohort had a significantly higher risk of opioid use (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.21, p < 0.001). Following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, NTND use among patients was associated with a higher risk of emergency department visits in the initial 90 days postoperatively. NTND use was associated with a higher postoperative opioid requirement in the initial 90 days following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and this increased narcotic usage was sustained at 3 years postoperatively. Patients should be counseled preoperatively about the elevated risks associated with non-tobacco nicotine products.",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,2025-05-27,10.1016/j.jse.2025.04.011,Jad J Lawand,Joseph A Abboud,"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation.

This retrospective cohort study used US national Medicaid data for youth 9 to 24 years of age who were prescribed antidepressants for a new episode of major depression from January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2019 (N = 196,364). Quality measures were derived from 3 Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures: (1) acute phase, the percentage of youth who remained on antidepressants for 3 months; (2) continuation phase, the percentage of youth who remained on antidepressants for 6 months; and (3) follow-up contacts, the percentage of youth who received at least 3 follow-up visits during the acute phase. Robust Poisson regression examined associations between demographic, clinical, and county-level factors and adherence. Approximately half (49.6%) of the youth were adherent to acute-phase medication management and 55.2% had at least 3 follow-up visits; only 26.5% met continuation phase metrics. Older age, minoritized racial/ethnic status, and substance use disorders were associated with lower adherence. In contrast, youth with chronic medical conditions, prior use of other psychotropic medications, or in foster care had higher adherence. A substantial proportion of youth with depression receiving antidepressant treatment do not receive care aligned with quality measures, with notable disparities among older youth and racial/ethnic minorities. Targeted quality improvement efforts are needed to close gaps in adherence and follow-up care, particularly for underserved populations, and to promote more consistent, equitable treatment delivery.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2025-05-27,10.1016/j.jaac.2025.05.011,Cynthia A Fontanella,Mark Olfson,"Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio; The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

Work context varies across race, ethnicity and sex. The objective is to examine the association of self-employment status and CVD risk factors across racial and ethnic minority status as well as sex. For this observational study, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (1999-2018), a cross-sectional study design, and stratified logistic regression models were used to explore the association between self-employment status (a dichotomous variable) and CVD risk factors (dichotomized measures of elevated cholesterol, hypertension, glucose intolerance, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, binge drinking, sub-optimal sleep duration and poor mental health) across combined racial and ethnic minority status and sex groups, among working, non-pregnant adults(ages 30-62). Statistical models controlled for age, education, marital status, household poverty-to-income ratio, and the number of months working at current job. The coefficient estimates were expressed as predictive margins. The study sample was comprised of 19,395 working adults. Among non-minority women, self-employment was negatively associated with obesity (% diff = -7.4%; p = 0.008), physical inactivity % diff = -7.0%; p = 0.017), and poor sleep duration (% diff = -9.4%; p = 0.004). Among minority women, self-employment was negatively associated with poor diet (% diff = -6.7%; p = 0.024), physical inactivity (% diff =-7.3%; p = 0.013) and poor sleep duration (% diff = -8.1%; p = 0.017). Among non-minority men, self-employment was negatively associated with poor diet (% diff = -6.5%; p = 0.008) and hypertension (% diff = -5.7%; p = 0.013). This study suggests that there may be a relationship between work context and CVD risk factors that varies across race, ethnicity and sex; however, further research is needed to characterize this relationship. Specifically, exploring how autonomy, flexibility, social support and discrimination exposure varies across self-employment status in diverse demographic groups may be important for illuminating the relationship between work and cardiovascular health.",BMC public health,2025-05-30,10.1186/s12889-025-22955-2,Kimberly Narain,José J Escarce,"Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, 1100 Glendon Ave, Suite 850 & 900, Los Angeles, CA, 90024, USA.

This study aims to determine patient factors associated with the need for more frequent TEP changes and maintenance in addition to TEP-associated complications. Patients who underwent TEP procedure were identified in the TriNetX Research Network. Cohorts were stratified by comorbidities, including diabetes, GERD, esophageal stricture, hypo/hyperthyroidism, tobacco and alcohol use, radiation history, and primary versus secondary TEP. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed time to prosthesis change, and risks of complications, including fistula formation, local infection, prosthesis leak, aspiration pneumonia, and dysphagia, were calculated. Among 4145 patients identified, diabetes was associated with increased risk of prosthesis leak and dysphagia. Hypothyroidism, GERD, and esophageal strictures were linked to higher rates of fistula formation, infection, prosthesis leak, aspiration pneumonia, and dysphagia. Primary TEP was associated with increased fistula and infection rates compared to secondary TEP. Radiation and tobacco use were significantly associated with dysphagia, and tobacco and alcohol use with higher infection and aspiration risks. Average time to TEP change was 72 days. Patients with GERD (HR 1.17, 95 % CI [1.06-1.29]) and esophageal stricture (HR 1.13, 95 % CI [1.02-1.26]) required more frequent prosthesis changes.

To control for the interference from folic acid fortification, we assessed the relationship between folate intake, serum folate, and red blood cell (RBC) folate levels and the risk of CRC death in a cohort established before fortification. We analyzed the data of 14,528 adults aged 19 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) as the baseline examination and were followed through December 31, 2006. Hazard ratios (HR) of CRC deaths were estimated for individuals with different folate intake and biomarker levels. Covariates included age, sex, family income, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, serum cotinine, vitamin supplements, and dietary energy intake. After 192,973 person-years (pys) of follow-up with a mean of 14 years, 78 CRC deaths were recorded. The CRC death rate was 0.75/1000 pys, 0.39/1000 pys, and 0.29/1000 pys for adults with low (lower quarter), moderate, and high (upper quarter) total dietary folate equivalent (tDFE, including both dietary and supplemental intake of folate); the adjusted HR was 0.12 (95% CI = 0.03, 0.45) for adults with high, and 0.51 (0.24, 1.11) for moderate tDFE compared to adults with low tDFE (p for trend = 0.09).

40455496,Assessing availability of depression severity indicators in electronic health record data: A retrospective study in two large academic health care systems in the United States.,"The high prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) combined with low treatment response supports continued research in this area. Electronic health records (EHR) are an important real-world data source for such MDD research, yet indicators of depression severity, a key confounder, are unreliably available. We examined the availability of depression severity indicators in the EHR and identified patient characteristics associated with having a severity indicator available for patients with an MDD diagnosis. We leveraged EHR data from academic health systems in Colorado and Utah from 2016 to 2021 to calculate the proportion of MDD encounters with a severity indicator from two sources in the EHR (diagnosis codes and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total scores). We compared characteristics between patients with and without severity indicators using chi-square and t tests. We also estimated the proportional agreement between the two sources of severity. Among 1.55 million encounters with an MDD diagnosis from 2016 to 2021, 38% had a severity indicator available from the diagnosis code or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score. Availability increased from 28% in 2016 to 47% in 2021. Overall agreement was low at the MDD encounter level. Hispanic patients and those with anxiety, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorder were more likely to have a severity indicator. While availability of depression severity in EHR data is increasing, it remains low. Researchers wanting to use depression severity data from the EHR should be cognizant of the potential impact of missing severity on their research and be cautious about using diagnosis codes and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores as indicators of severity in isolation.

40455735,Association of initiating CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with risks of adverse outcomes in older adults receiving antidepressants: A retrospective cohort study.,"The safety of pharmacokinetic opioid-antidepressant interactions may be affected by the sequence in which the drug is initiated. Previous literature showed that initiation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6-inhibiting versus CYP2D6-neutral antidepressants concomitantly with existing CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction) was associated with heightened risks of adverse outcomes (e.g., worsening pain). However, little is known about whether and to what extent the risks exist when CYP2D6-metabolized opioids are initiated on existing antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction), a more common pattern of concomitant use of these two drugs. The study aims to examine the association of initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids with risks of adverse outcomes among older nursing home residents who already received antidepressants. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a 100% Medicare nursing home sample linked to Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021. Participants included long-term care residents 65 years of age or older who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants for at least 30 days. The key exposure was the use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, with day 1 of antidepressant-opioid concomitant use designated as cohort entry. Patients were followed from cohort entry until the end of 1 year, nursing home discharge, death, or study end (12/31/2021). Seven adverse outcomes included worsening pain, physical function, and depression, and counts of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose (OD). We identified 127,200 older nursing home long-term residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants (mean [SD] age, 84.4 [8.7] years). After covariate adjustment via inverse probability of treatment weighting, use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with a higher risk of worsening pain (relative risk:1.04 [95% CI, 1.02, 1.06]; P < 0.001; risk difference (RD): 1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%, 1.6%]) and a higher incidence rate of pain-related hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR]:1.13 [95% CI, 1.04, 1.22]; P = 0.003; RD: 1.21 [95% CI, 0.39, 1.89] per 1,000 patient-years) and pain-related ED visits (IRR = 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07, 1.29]; P = 0.003; RD: 0.85 [95% CI, 0.29, 1.41] per 1,000 patient-years), with no difference in physical function, depression, OUD, and OD. Main study limitations included unmeasured confounding and limited generalizability. This cohort study of older nursing home residents showed that initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with increased risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalizations, and pain-related ED visits, although the relative and absolute risks are small to moderate. Clinicians should be aware of potential worsening pain and hospital and ED visits due to pain among patients who used CYP2D6-metabolizing opioids concomitantly with antidepressants, particularly those with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants.",PLoS medicine,2025-06-01,10.1371/journal.pmed.1004620,Yu-Jung Jenny Wei,Stephan Schmidt,"Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, Colleges of Medicine and Public Health & Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Community Health and Family Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Statistics, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Neurology, McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.; Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.","Humans, Analgesics, Opioid, Aged, Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6, Antidepressive Agents, Male, Retrospective Studies, Female, Aged, 80 and over, Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors, Drug Interactions, United States, Nursing Homes, Medicare",N/A

Whether exposure to ozone concentrations consistently below current U.S. regulatory limits (70 ppb, 8-hour average) is associated with newly-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear, especially among demographic subgroups. We examined associations between residential ozone and incident COPD in a large prospective cohort study in the U.S., and assessed heterogeneity by demographic subgroups. The All of Us research program followed >848,000 volunteers enrolled in 2017-2023. Among 596, 926 participants whom consented to the release of EHR data, annual average ozone concentrations from satellite measurements from 2000-2016 were linked to residential location for 376,535 participants. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate associations between ozone and incident COPD over the study period, adjusting for co-exposures and potential confounders. We assessed effect modification using cross-product terms and stratified analyses with race, sex, age, income, and smoking status. To account for non-probabilistic sampling, we applied cell weighting based on the distribution of key factors from the 2018-2022 American Community Survey. We identified 7,907 incident COPD cases over an average 4-year follow-up. Residential ozone concentrations (Median: 37.75 ppb, Min-Max: 29.79-51.39) were similar across subgroups. Overall, we observed a positive, non-monotonic relationship between ozone and COPD risk, driven by the highest quartile of exposure (HR  Even consistently below U.S. regulatory limits, the respiratory effects of ozone were apparent independent of smoking.

40466339,Association between SSRI use and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and generalized anxiety disorder: A real-world cohort study.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly prevalent among CAD patients, worsening cardiovascular outcomes. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for anxiety disorders, their impact on cardiovascular prognosis in patients with CAD and GAD remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study utilized real-world data from the TriNetX database. Patients diagnosed with both CAD and GAD between 2016 and 2025 were included and categorized into SSRI users and non-users. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included individual MACE components and all-cause hospitalization. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. After 1:1 PSM, 54,526 SSRIs users and 54,526 non-users were analyzed. SSRIs use was significantly associated with a lower one-year risk of MACE (HR: 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.74-0.81, p < 0.001). Similar protective effects were observed across secondary outcomes and subgroups, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, and nicotine dependence. Landmark analyses confirmed consistent results. Negative control analyses showed no significant differences, minimizing bias. SSRIs use is associated with a lower one-year MACE rate in patients with CAD and GAD. These findings highlight the potential cardiovascular benefits of SSRIs in this population. Further clinical trials are warranted to validate these results and explore long-term effects.",Atherosclerosis,2025-06-02,10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2025.120390,Jheng-Yan Wu,Yu-Min Lin,"Department of Nutrition, Chi Mei Medical Centre, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

40480966,Maternal Prenatal Cannabis Use and Major Structural Birth Defects.,"We evaluated associations between prenatal cannabis use and major structural birth defects of the child. This population-based retrospective cohort study comprised singleton births (January 2011-July 2020) universally screened for substance use at entrance to prenatal care. Prenatal cannabis use was defined as self-reported use or a positive toxicology test during pregnancy. Electronic health record and birth certificate data were used to identify 38 specific major structural birth defects within 8 organ systems (i.e., central nervous, eye, ear, cardiac, orofacial/respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary/renal, and musculoskeletal). Modified Poisson regression models were conducted adjusting for propensity scores. Of 363,952 infants, 22,494(6.2%) were exposed to maternal prenatal cannabis use, and 6094 infants (2.17%) had a major structural birth defect. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with gastroschisis in the unadjusted (RR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.25-3.19) and other non-cannabis prenatal substance use (aRR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.71) adjusted models, but not in the models adjusted for maternal age or the propensity score. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with omphalocele in the unadjusted model (RR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.42-6.48), maternal age-adjusted model (aRR = 3.54; 95% CI: 1.68-7.48), other prenatal substance use-adjusted model (aRR = 3.31; 95% CI: 1.50-7.31), and propensity score adjusted model (aRR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.26-6.77). Cases of gastroschisis and omphalocele were rare: n = 172 (0.05%) and n = 48 (0.01%), respectively. No associations emerged between maternal prenatal cannabis use and any other birth defects. Findings were replicated when cannabis was defined by toxicology testing only. Maternal prenatal cannabis use was associated with an increased risk for gastroschisis and omphalocele.

Globally, there is considerable variability in reported rates of mental disorders among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), limiting timely intervention and evidence-based treatment among this population. We estimate the prevalence of specific mental disorders among individuals with a concurrent OUD using population-level administrative data in British Columbia, Canada.MethodA population-based retrospective observational study using individual-level linked health administrative data in British Columbia, Canada. Individuals with an OUD and concurrent mental disorder between January 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021, were included and followed from their first indication of OUD until censoring (death, administrative loss to follow-up, or August 31, 2021). We reported annual period (2013-2021) prevalence rates and age-standardized prevalence rates per 100,000 population (stratified by sex).ResultsThe population included 73,855 individuals (female 40.6%, median age, 36 [27-48]) with an OUD and concurrent mental disorder. During the observation period anxiety disorders were the most prevalent (91.7%) mental disorders followed by depression (73.6%), bipolar disorder (35.3%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (20.4%), and personality disorders (19.5%). Among the population, the annual period prevalence of any mental disorder increased from 35,603 in 2013 to 60,940 in 2021, with an average annual percent difference of 7.0%, driven by increases in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Overall, the annual age-standardized prevalence of any mental disorder was higher among males.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a steadily growing prevalence of people with OUD and a concurrent mental disorder and emphasize the need for access to mental disorder treatment among this population.

40495525,Telehealth Prescribing of Stimulants for ADHD and Associated Risk for Later Stimulant and Substance Use Disorders.,"The authors sought to determine 1) whether receiving an initial stimulant prescription for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from a provider whom a patient has never seen in person is associated with increased risk for stimulant use disorder (stimUD) or other substance use disorders (SUDs), and 2) whether receiving an initial stimulant prescription during a telehealth versus in-person appointment is associated with increased risk for stimUD or SUD. This was a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from March 1, 2020, to August 25, 2023, from a not-for-profit, academically affiliated medical system in the Northeastern United States. Eligible study subjects were ≥12 years old with ADHD and initial receipt of any stimulant prescription during the study period. Exclusion criteria included a non-nicotine SUD diagnosis at the time of initial stimulant prescription. The sample included 7,944 patients. After adjustment for covariates, a purely telehealth-based relationship versus any in-person relationship did not significantly alter risk for SUD (adjusted odds ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.60, 1.20) or stimUD (adjusted odds ratio=1.28, 95% CI=0.34, 4.85). A telehealth versus in-person appointment at the time of the initial stimulant prescription did not significantly alter risk for subsequent SUD (adjusted odds ratio=1.15, 95% CI=0.92, 1.44) but was associated with significantly higher risk for stimUD (adjusted odds ratio=6.18, 95% CI=1.34, 28.46). The results suggest that receipt of a stimulant prescription for ADHD via telehealth does not alter the risk for SUD, but receipt of an initial stimulant prescription via telehealth may signal increased risk of subsequent stimUD.

To investigate differences in the treatment of PAD between Black and White patients over time and by US state. This cohort study examined data for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a PAD diagnosis between 2018 and 2022. Data were analyzed from November 14, 2023, to February 13, 2025. Black and White race. The proportions of Black and White patients with PAD undergoing revascularization and major amputation were compared over time and by state. Data were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, chronic kidney disease, and county-level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The total sample size was 2 376 300 beneficiaries (1 224 537 men [51.5%]). Black patients (219 338 [9.2%]) were slightly younger than White patients (2 156 962 [90.8%]; mean [SD] age, 75.8 [7.9] years vs 76.9 [7.8] years; P < .001) and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. A higher proportion of Black patients (8.9%) than White patients (7.6%) underwent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.18-1.21]; P < .001), and a higher proportion of Black patients (2.8%) than White patients (1.0%) underwent major amputation (odds ratio, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.83-2.99]; P < .001). Higher proportions of Black patients than White patients underwent revascularization and major amputation in the majority of states, although with marked variation in these proportional differences across states. The proportions of Black and White patients who underwent revascularization decreased over time (from 8.0% to 7.4% for Black patients and from 6.8% to 6.2% for White patients). The proportion of Black patients who underwent major amputation decreased (from 2.9% to 2.5%; P < .001), but there was no change among White patients (from 0.7% to 0.7%; P = .53). Revascularization correlated weakly (ρ = 0.10), and amputation correlated moderately with SVI (ρ = 0.46). These findings suggest that higher proportions of Black patients than White patients undergo invasive procedures for PAD, with considerable variation across states. Although the proportional difference in major amputations has narrowed over time, the persistent proportional excess of major amputations among Black patients requires further study to investigate whether this difference reflects remediable disparities in care.",JAMA cardiology,2025-06-11,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.1714,Birgit Vogel,Roxana Mehran,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Oxford University School of Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, Titusville, New Jersey.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, Titusville, New Jersey.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, Titusville, New Jersey.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, Titusville, New Jersey.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, Titusville, New Jersey.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.",N/A,N/A

The study is a retrospective observational cohort study using administrative data from all patients presenting with substance use disorder (SUD) at Health Sciences North (HSN) from January 1, 2018, to August 31, 2023. Patients were placed in two groups: those with alcohol-related presentations and those with opioid-related presentations. The outcome was the time and number of ED visits between the index ED visit and first admission to the hospital for the substance-related presentation. A total of 5,240 individuals (45.98%) presented with opioid use, and 6,140 individuals (45.61%) presented with alcohol use. The opioid group was younger (mean age = 36.86 years, compared to 44.58 years in the alcohol group) and had higher rates of current homelessness (37.47% vs. 9.63%), a higher prevalence of mental disorders (15.71% vs. 10.68%), and a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cellulitis (5.24% vs. 0.52%). Despite similarities in 30-day ED revisits (41.53% for alcohol vs. 40.88% for opioids) and mean length of stay (12.16 days for opioids vs. 10.04 days for alcohol), individuals in the opioid group had a higher likelihood of inpatient admission with each additional ED visit (hazard ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.19, 1.37]).

40504508,Persistent prescription opioid use and all-cause mortality following the first-year breast cancer survivorship.,"Harm associated with persistent opioid use beyond the first-year intensive cancer treatment is underinvestigated in cancer survivors. We examined rates and risk factors for persistent opioid use and all-cause mortality after the first-year breast cancer survivorship. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California for women diagnosed with a nonmetastatic breast cancer between 2009 and 2019 who filled 2 or more opioid prescriptions. Rates of persistent opioid use were estimated from first-year survivorship through December 31, 2021. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with persistent use were estimated using a multivariable Poisson regression model. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality associated with persistent opioid use were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Of 14 347 eligible individuals (mean [SD] age = 61.9 [12.5]), 2285 (15.9%) developed persistent opioid use, with an incident rate of 25.5 per 1000 person-years. Risk factors included older age (≥65 vs < 65 years: RR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.24 to 2.14), smoking (current: 1.89, 1.68 to 2.13; former: 1.30, 1.20 to 1.41), baseline comorbidities (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 5+ vs 0: 1.70, 1.29 to 2.24), and substance use disorders (1.58, 1.43 to 1.74). All-cause mortality was doubled among individuals with persistent use (51.6, 48.0 to 55.6 per 1000 person-years) than in those without (25.3, 24.2 to 26.4).

40506013,Association between buprenorphine adherence for opioid use disorder and clinical events and healthcare spending among older patients.,"Buprenorphine adherence in older adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) remains underexplored. This study investigated the associations between buprenorphine adherence and risks of opioid overdose, hospitalization, and healthcare spending among older adults to help inform practice and policy. In this retrospective cohort study, we utilized the Merative MarketScan® Database (2017-2019) to identify Medicare Advantage enrollees with OUD who initiated buprenorphine and were retrospectively followed for 180 days. We classified patients as adherent (Proportion of Days Covered ≥0.80) or non-adherent to buprenorphine. We balanced baseline characteristics between groups using an inverse probability treatment weighting approach. We then evaluated the associations between adherence and the risks of opioid overdose and all-cause hospitalization using discrete-time survival and Cox proportional hazards models respectively. Finally, we estimated differences in healthcare spending between adherent and non-adherent patients using generalized linear models. The cohort included 631 patients (379 [60 %] male; mean (SD) age:67 [2.8] years). Among them, 437 (69 %) were adherent to buprenorphine. Patients with a history of chronic pain, mental health disorders, and diabetes were less likely to adhere while higher average daily doses of buprenorphine were associated with increased adherence. Adherence was associated with reduced risks of opioid overdose (HR:0.76; 95%CI:0.59-0.93) and hospitalization (HR:0.55; 95%CI:0.42-0.73). Healthcare spending among adherent patients was $40,200 [95%CI:$54,712-25,687]) lower than in non-adherent patients. These findings were consistent across robustness and sensitivity analyses. Buprenorphine adherence was associated with reduced risks of opioid overdose, hospitalization, and healthcare spending in the overall population of older individuals with OUD. Enhancing adherence to buprenorphine should be prioritized in OUD treatment strategies among this population.",Journal of substance use and addiction treatment,2025-06-10,10.1016/j.josat.2025.209740,Olajumoke A Olateju,J Douglas Thornton,"Prescription Drug Misuse Education and Research Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, TX, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, TX, USA.

40512511,Early School Medicaid Expansions and Health Services for Children With Parental Opioid Use Disorder.,"Children experiencing parental opioid use disorder are a growing population at heightened risk of physical and mental health issues over the life course. Yet these children are less likely to receive comprehensive, ongoing health care and their parents are more likely to report barriers to access health care for their children. School-based health services have potential to overcome some of these health care access barriers, including parental burden, transportation, time, costs, and health care discontinuity. In 2014, Medicaid revoked its longstanding free care rule, expanding the scope of school-based health services eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Subsequently, some states began to expand their school Medicaid programs to benefit from the new federal rule. To estimate the early effects of state school Medicaid expansions on the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services among children who have experienced parental opioid use disorder. This cohort study using nationwide Medicaid claims data included Medicaid-enrolled children aged 5 to 18 years who experienced parental opioid use disorder at any point before age 19 years. A difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered implementation of school Medicaid expansions between 2014 and 2019 was used. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and January 2025. Children living in states implementing (treatment group) and not implementing (comparison group) school Medicaid expansions, before and after state-specific expansion dates. Binary measures indicating receipt of school-based health services, primary care, prevention, rehabilitative, dental, and mental health services, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospital stays. The sample comprised 6 628 404 person-years from 1 700 304 children. The mean (SD) age was 10.5 (3.9) years and 3 371 918 (51%) were male. School Medicaid expansions increased the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services by 8.9 percentage points (pp; P = .01). Growth was primarily driven by school claims for nursing services (difference, 7.4 pp; P = .02) and for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment services (difference, 8.6 pp; P = .04). Reductions in emergency department visits among children aged 5 to 11 years were also documented (difference, -1.8 pp; P = .02). This cohort study found that, given the complex health and health care needs of children growing up amid the opioid crisis, integrating health care into schools may offer a promising policy solution.",JAMA health forum,2025-06-07,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1288,Angélica Meinhofer,Maria Fitzpatrick,"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.; School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.; Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Jeb E.

We evaluated the baseline characteristics and outcomes (exacerbation rate, mortality, and healthcare resource utilization [HCRU]) of this COPD population, overall and by smoking status. A retrospective real-world cohort study of US patients was conducted using Optum's deidentified Market Clarity Data, an integrated claims and electronic health record database (study period: 2015-2019). Patients eligible for inclusion were aged ≥40 years, with a COPD diagnosis, continuous 12-month (baseline) period of treatment with TT, and record of ≥2 moderate or ≥1 severe exacerbation during baseline. Follow-up was either variable (from end of baseline to death, loss to follow-up, or end of 2019) or fixed (12 months). Baseline characteristics and treatment patterns, crude incidence rates (IRs) for exacerbations and mortality (per 100 person-years [PYs]; variable follow-up), and HCRU and costs (12-month follow-up) were summarized descriptively. Of 4,920 patients in the TT cohort, mean (SD) age was 62.3 (9.7) years, 60.9% were female, and 68.0% were white; 46.5% of TT cohort patients with a history of smoking were current smokers. Hypertension (92.7%), ischemic heart disease (52.1%), and heart failure (40.1%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities. Most patients received oral corticosteroids (89.6%) or antibiotics (92.8%) for exacerbation management during baseline. Add-on therapies included phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (10.4%) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (26.4%). During follow-up, IRs (95% CI) were 108.2 (104.7-111.8) per 100 PY for any moderate/severe exacerbation and 8.0 (7.4-8.6) per 100 PY for mortality. Exacerbation risk was similar by smoking status. During the 12-month follow-up, mean (SD) all-cause and COPD costs were $63,178 ($77,061) and $26,153 ($47,085), respectively. There is high mortality and considerable HCRU and healthcare costs incurred by people with COPD experiencing frequent moderate/severe exacerbations while on TT.

We assessed the prevalence of SUD among BD hospitalization episodes and analyzed its association with hospitalization outcomes. We performed a retrospective observational study using a database containing all hospitalizations registered in Portuguese public hospitals from 2008 to 2015. Hospitalizations with a primary or secondary diagnosis of BD were selected. To compare episodes with and without a diagnosis of SUD, an independent sample  SUD was registered in 11.3% of episodes, with alcohol use disorder being the most prevalent (5.8%). A non-linear increase in the number of hospitalizations throughout the study period was found. Episodes with a concomitant register of SUD were associated with younger (44.1 ± 12.5 years old) and male hospitalizations (56.6%), shorter length of stay (LoS) (15.0 (8.0;24.0) days), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (0.24 ± 0.76), and with higher rates of attention-deficit, conduct, and disruptive behavior disorders, personality disorders, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury, compared to those without this comorbidity.

40532747,Alcohol use disorder exacerbates clinical and vascular risks differentially in psychiatric disorders.,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major public health concern with detrimental effects on cognitive and neurological function, yet its impact on psychiatric populations remains incompletely defined. In this global propensity score-matched cohort study, we examined the clinical and vascular consequences of comorbid alcohol abuse across diverse psychiatric disorders. Data from the TriNetX network, encompassing electronic medical records from 143 healthcare organizations, were analyzed. For each disorder-anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, reaction to severe stress, eating disorders, personality disorders, psychoactive substance dependence, developmental disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-patients with alcohol abuse were matched 1:1 to those without, controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Over a 1095-day follow-up, outcomes evaluated included emergency department visits, pain prevalence, mortality, and cerebrovascular events (transient ischemic attacks and strokes). Alcohol abuse was consistently associated with significantly higher emergency care utilization, increased somatic pain, and elevated mortality across all groups. For instance, anxiety and depression cohorts exhibited 8.1% and 7.3% higher emergency visits and increased mortality by 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively, while schizophrenia showed a twofold increase in stroke risk and markedly higher pain (risk ratio 2.21). These results underscore that AUD exacerbates clinical and vascular risks in psychiatric patients, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2025-06-16,10.1016/j.alcohol.2025.06.003,Eva Christina Meyer,Younes Adam Tabi,"Department for Internal Medicine, Schön Klinik Eckernförde, Schleswiger Str. 114, 24340 Eckernförde, Germany.; Department for Neurology, University Medical Centre Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Str 3, 24105 Kiel, Germany.

40537088,Health Services Usage in Patients Receiving Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder or Long-Term Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Patients using buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) or long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain are at risk for poor outcomes if care is interrupted. Both treatments are highly regulated, with prepandemic requirements for in-person care. COVID-19 may have resulted in barriers to accessing in-person care through disruptions in care delivery. However, there were also opportunities for improved access to telemedicine visits through policy changes. This study aims to evaluate changes in health care and telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic among patients using buprenorphine for OUD and long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. We used administrative claims data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. We included patients using buprenorphine for OUD or long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain compared to patients with another chronic condition without similar prescribing restrictions: serious mental illness. We evaluated changes in in-person and telemedicine care by comparing rates of services by physician specialty, type of service, and the percentage of visits through telemedicine. Changes in usage were measured using a difference-in-differences approach with Poisson regression. The results are presented as incident rate ratios (IRR). We found declines in in-person visits in April 2020 across the buprenorphine, chronic opioids, and serious mental illness cohorts. The largest declines were for specialties that rely on in-person treatment, such as emergency medicine (IRR range 0.60-0.62), orthopedics (IRR 0.48-0.52), cardiology (IRR 0.64-0.78), and oncology (IRR 0.77-0.81). In contrast, there were smaller declines for specialties that could more easily transition to telemedicine, namely family practice (IRR 0.80-0.92), mental health (IRR 0.92-1.01), and pain medicine (IRR 0.87-1.08). The percentage of telemedicine visits for these specialties ranged from 30% to 51% in the period. There were also large declines for specific services, including emergency medicine (IRR 0.53-0.89), physical therapy (IRR 0.24-0.72), and new office visits (IRR 0.38-0.64). By January 2022, usage was similar to prepandemic levels, but the percentage of telemedicine visits remained elevated for family practice (10%-14%), mental health (34%-43%), and pain medicine (11%-15%) through January 2022. The results were similar across the cohorts, although in April 2020 there was a modest decrease (IRR 0.87) for pain medicine in the serious mental illness cohort, but the differences were not significant for the buprenorphine (IRR 1.08) and chronic opioids (IRR: 0.99) cohorts. These findings highlight the value of telemedicine to maintain access among people at risk for poor outcomes if care is interrupted. While flexibilities in the regulation of telemedicine services that arose during the pandemic have been temporarily extended multiple times, they are set to expire in 2025 without further action. Making these changes to telemedicine regulation permanent may benefit vulnerable patient populations who face access to care challenges.",JMIR formative research,2025-06-19,10.2196/66596,Samuel T Savitz,Molly M Jeffery,"Division of Health Care Delivery Research, Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.; Division of Health Care Delivery Research, Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.; Division of Health Care Delivery Research, Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.","Humans, Chronic Pain, Buprenorphine, Retrospective Studies, Opioid-Related Disorders, Male, Female, COVID-19, Middle Aged, Telemedicine, Analgesics, Opioid, United States, Adult, Opiate Substitution Treatment, Aged, SARS-CoV-2, Patient Acceptance of Health Care","OUD, buprenorphine, chronic, claims data, cohort, health care utilization, opioid use disorder, opioids, pain, retrospective, services, telehealth, telemedicine, usage, utilization"

Although generally rare, surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common postoperative complications following this procedure. This study used a nationwide database to assess the incidence and risk factors for SSIs following arthroscopic hip surgery. Following a retrospective query of a nationwide administrative claims database for adults (>18 years old) undergoing primary hip arthroscopy from 2010 to 2021, patients were categorized into two cohorts based on whether they did (N = 235) or did not (N = 75,342) develop an SSI within 90 days of surgery. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratio (OR) of developing SSIs within 90 days following hip arthroscopy, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities comprising the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The overall incidence of SSIs following hip arthroscopy was 0.31%, with no notable change over the study period (P = 0.697). The two cohorts were similar in age (P = 0.0716), sex (P = 0.2959), and geographic location (P = 0.5995). Overall comorbidity burden was markedly higher among patients who did (ECI = 4.1) versus those who did not (ECI = 2.2) develop SSIs (P < 0.0001). Risk factors for SSIs following hip arthroscopy included depression (OR: 2.02, P < 0.0001), preoperative fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (OR: 1.81, P = 0.0001), history of drug abuse (OR: 1.74, P = 0.00098), and coagulopathy (OR: 1.58, P = 0.0312). Substratification demonstrated that morbidly obese patients (≥35.00 kg/m2) were more likely to develop SSIs (OR: 4.52, P < 0.0001) compared with patients of normal body mass index. The overall rate of SSIs is low following hip arthroscopy. Certain patient-specific factors may be associated with SSIs and warrant further understanding to prevent these occurrences. This study may guide careful and intentional patient selection and optimization before hip arthroscopy, in efforts to reduce the rate of this event.

To study the characteristics and circumstances associated with the occurrence of seizures in individuals using cannabinoids for medical or recreational purposes. A retrospective analysis of spontaneous reports of adverse drug effects issued by the French pharmacovigilance and addictovigilance systems, and by manufacturers, extracted data from the Eudravigilance database (01/01/1985-21/07/2023). The request used the broad MedDRA SMQ term 'convulsive', with all products containing cannabinoids (THC, CBD, cannabis or natural cannabinoids). Among 4296 notifications with cannabinoids, 130 (3%) reports of convulsive effects were analysed: 29 cases (23.3%) related to medical use (27 CBD, 1 THC and 2 combined THC/CBD preparations) and 98 (75.4%) related to recreational use. The median age was 29.0 years (min-max: 3-75), 78.7% were men and 81.1% were serious cases. Among the recreational users, 38.8% used Cannabis sativa with a history of epilepsy, and 68.4% of them were taking antiepileptics. In total, 67.7% of individuals had at least one risk factor for seizures, i.e., 31.0% among medical users and 78.6% among recreational users. The main risk factors with medical use were inefficacy of CBD (17.2%), fatigue (13.8%) and concomitant epileptogenic medications (10.3%). The main risk with recreational use was concomitant epileptogenic medications (39.8%), consumption of illicit drugs (33.7%) and alcohol (32.7%).

Retrospective analysis of single-question, patient-centered screen for substance use and care linkage.","Emergency Department (ED) screening for substance use disorder (SUD) is limited by a lack of standardization and challenging clinical environments. Existing tools may be focused on informing clinicians rather than supporting patients.

40541494,Opioid Use in Patients With Testicular Cancer: Patterns and Risk Factors.,"Prescription opioid use is a gateway to chronic dependence and associated morbidity and mortality. Research has demonstrated that men receiving narcotics after urologic surgery are at increased risk of persistent opioid use. However, factors associated with persistent use in testicular cancer patients specifically are poorly understood. The Truven Marketscan database was queried for patients with testicular cancer who underwent orchiectomy between 2009 and 2021. Patients who were under 18 years old, lacked insurance coverage during the study period, filled opioid prescriptions 3 months prior to orchiectomy, or had prior opioid use disorder diagnoses were excluded. Subgroup analysis was performed by receipt of advanced treatment, defined as chemotherapy and/or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Opioid exposure was defined as receipt of ≥ 1 opioid prescriptions within 30 days of last treatment. Among those who underwent advanced treatment, pretreatment opioid use over the cohort median in oral morphine equivalents (OME) was included in the definition of opioid exposure. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with our primary outcome: ≥ 1 filled opioid prescription between 31 to 90 days and 91 to 180 days after last treatment. Of 5409 total patients, 2115 (39.1%) underwent advanced treatment: 1697 (31.4%) chemotherapy, 185 (3.4%) RPLND, and 223 (4.3%) chemotherapy and RPLND (combination). Opioid exposure was associated with a filled opioid prescription at 31 to 90 (OR 4.67) and 91 to 180 days (OR 4.74, both P < .001) after last treatment. On multivariate analysis, chemotherapy and combination therapy, but not RPLND alone, were independently associated with opioid use at 31 to 180 days post-treatment (P < .001). Testicular cancer patients who received opioid prescriptions after orchiectomy were more likely to require additional opioid prescriptions 31 to 180 days after treatment. Advanced treatment with chemotherapy alone or combined with RPLND, but not RPLND alone, increased the opioid dependence.",Clinical genitourinary cancer,2025-05-29,10.1016/j.clgc.2025.102381,Siddharth Marthi,Shreyas S Joshi,"Department of Urology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.

40543828,Opioid Consumption Patterns Before and After Elective Joint Surgery.,"Opioid use is associated with multiple risks, including accidental overdose and addiction. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty are among the most common elective procedures. The goal of surgery is to relieve patients of their joint pain and reduce dependence on analgesics, but these procedures can result in chronic opioid use. This retrospective analysis occurred at Kaiser Permanente Washington between March 2018 and May 2023. A preoperative opioid user was defined as a patient who had filled two or more opioid prescriptions in the 3-month preoperative period. A Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between preoperative opioid use and continued use of opioids 10 to 12 months postoperatively. Of 8,886 patients who underwent a TKA or total hip arthroplasty, 24% were considered preoperative opioid users. The average age was 68 years, and 59% of patients were women. Over the study period, the total number of opioid prescriptions filled was 43,326. At 10 to 12 months postoperatively, 39% of preoperative opioid users continued using opioids compared with 9% of nonchronic opioid users (P < 0.05). Exploratory analysis showed factors associated with a higher likelihood of persistent opioid use 10 to 12 months postoperatively include women and undergoing a TKA procedure. Understanding opioid utilization after total joint arthroplasty is essential to identifying strategies to minimize overprescribing and promote rational opioid use. Approximately 39% of preoperative opioid users and 9% of nonchronic opioid users continued use of opioids for 10 to 12 months after surgery. Specific patient characteristics were associated with the development of persistent postoperative opioid use. Although this study did not include multivariate analysis, which limits the conclusions we can draw from this data, the magnitude of the trends noted is large enough to warrant further studies.",The Journal of arthroplasty,2025-06-19,10.1016/j.arth.2025.06.053,Melina Martinez,Edwin Lojeski,"Specialty Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Specialty Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Clinical Pharmacy Programs, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Pharmacy Programs - Pain Management, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.; Pain Medicine Physician, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Renton, Washington.",N/A,"arthroplasty, opioids, pain, pain management, postoperative pain"
40548290,Long-term risk of diabetes following hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: A retrospective cohort study.,"The impact of varying degrees of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) on the risk of developing diabetes later in life is currently unknown. To assess the long-term risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), prediabetes, and mortality that are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX United States Collaborative Network to examine outcomes, especially T2DM, prediabetes and mortality, related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in females aged 21-45. Participants had no history of hypertension or diabetes before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. Propensity score matching was applied to balance covariates such as gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, overweight/obesity, nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse, and healthcare utilization. This ensured comparability between groups and reduced potential confounding in outcome evaluation. This study included 318544 females aged 21-45 with and without PIH. Females with PIH had higher risks of T2DM [hazard ratio (HR): 1.907, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.821-1.998), prediabetes (HR: 1.610, 95%CI: 1.537-1.687), and mortality (HR: 1.501, 95%CI: 1.361-1.655) over a follow-up of up to 18 years. Incidence rates for T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality were 3.2%, 2.7%, and 0.6%, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the presence of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia increased risks across all outcomes. Persistent hypertension beyond 12 weeks postpartum was linked to more than a 3-fold increase in mortality. Preventative aspirin use during pregnancy did not reduce the risks of T2DM, prediabetes, or mortality among those with PIH. PIH significantly increases the long-term risks of T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for improved long-term management strategies to enhance overall health in such individuals.",World journal of diabetes,2025-06-15,10.4239/wjd.v16.i6.105080,Yu-Hsiang Shih,Chia-Chi Lung,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung City 40705, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Occupational Health Nursing Center, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan. dinoljc@csmu.edu.tw.",N/A,"Eclampsia, Gestational hypertension, Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Mortality, Prediabetes, Preeclampsia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus"
40548404,Mortality and hospital admissions in people with eating disorders: longitudinal cohort study in secondary care-linked English primary care records.,"Research on mortality and admissions for physical health problems across eating disorder diagnoses in representative settings is scarce. Inequalities in these outcomes across a range of sociodemographic characteristics have rarely been investigated. We investigated whether people with eating disorders had greater all-cause mortality and physical health-related in-patient admissions compared with those without eating disorders, and whether associations varied by sex, ethnicity, deprivation, age and calendar year at diagnosis. Using primary care Clinical Research Practice Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, we matched people with an incident eating disorder diagnosis (any, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorders not otherwise specified, generic eating disorder or a referral code) from primary care Read codes to four people without eating disorders (1:4 matching) on year of birth, sex, primary care practice, year of registration and index date. We used univariable and multivariable Cox (mortality) and Poisson (admissions) models, and fitted interactions to investigate whether associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. We included 58 735 people (90.1% female, 91.6% White). People with any eating disorders had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.73-2.67). Anorexia nervosa had the highest mortality (hazard ratio: 3.49, 95% CI: 2.43-5.01). People with any eating disorders had higher rates of planned (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.80, 95% CI: 1.4-1.87) and emergency admissions for physical health problems (IRR: 2.35. 95% CI: 2.35-2.46) and emergency admissions for injuries, accidents and substance misuse (IRR: 5.26, 95% CI: 5.24-5.29). Mortality and admission rate ratios were greater in males. People with eating disorders have high rates of mortality and physical health-related admissions. Observed inequalities call for an understanding of why such inequalities exist. These findings highlight the need for prompt and effective treatment for eating disorders, and for improved guidance on primary care management of people with eating disorders.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2025-06-23,10.1192/bjp.2025.69,Annie Jeffery,Francesca Solmi,"Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.; North London Mental Health Partnership, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.; North London Mental Health Partnership, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.; North London Mental Health Partnership, London, UK.; Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, UK.; Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust, Gloucester, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, UK.; Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, UK.",N/A,"CPRD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), Eating disorders, Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES), hospital admissions"
40549490,Description of Physician Champion Efforts to Expand Buprenorphine Treatment in Primary Care and Explore a Quality Implementation Measure of Success: Buprenorphine as a Percentage of All Opioids Prescribed.,"This study describes the impact of a single physician champion's implementation efforts to increase buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) in primary care and a ""proof-of-concept"" new quality electronic health record outcome indicative of success. Five primary care clinics at one academic medical center participated in this retrospective program evaluation conducted from October 2021 to December 2023. A physician champion led all implementation strategies for buprenorphine prescribing, including ""en bloc"" group engagement and training of physicians at clinic A; a limited set of implementation resources was later shared with clinic B. Clinics C-E served as controls. Electronic health record outcome measures from each clinic included (1) percent of clinicians prescribing buprenorphine, (2) number of buprenorphine prescriptions, (3) number of full opioid agonist prescriptions, and (4) percentage buprenorphine (PB) prescriptions defined as the number of buprenorphine prescriptions divided by the sum of the total number of buprenorphine and full mu-opioid agonist prescriptions. During the 2-year period at clinic A, all clinicians prescribed buprenorphine; there was a decrease in full agonist prescribing, and PB increased from 0% to 30.8%. PB increased also at Clinic B. Buprenorphine prescribing did not increase, full agonist prescribing was stable, and PB remained <10% at control clinics. These results show that a single physician can help other clinicians initiate and sustain buprenorphine prescribing. The PB metric, which includes full agonist prescribing along with buprenorphine, may be a particularly important quality metric for tracking implementation progress and quality improvement.",Journal of addiction medicine,2025-06-23,10.1097/ADM.0000000000001535,Thaddeus R Salmon,Michelle R Lofwall,"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (TRS); Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (AMS); Departments of Behavioral Science and Psychiatry, Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY (MRL).",N/A,"buprenorphine, implementation science, office-based opioid treatment, opioid use disorder, quality improvement"
40549495,Management of Opioid Use Disorder Among Peripartum Individuals During Hospitalization.,"Peripartum opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health concern. Although hospital admission for labor and delivery is common, little is known about hospitalized peripartum individuals with OUD or their inpatient management. The purpose of this study was to characterize hospitalized peripartum individuals with OUD who were seen by an OUD consult service and to examine their inpatient OUD treatment. This was a retrospective cohort study of peripartum individuals who received an OUD consult from May 2020 to April 2022. All individuals were pregnant or up to 3 months postpartum at admission. Substance use and psychosocial history were collected, along with timing and acceptance of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and details of discharge transitions. Of the 23 peripartum individuals with OUD who received a consult during admission, 61% were white, 30% were black, and all were non-Hispanic. Most individuals (78%) had Medicaid. Only 30% were using MOUD at hospital admission. Two-thirds (63%) of those not using MOUD were started on treatment during hospitalization, most commonly with buprenorphine-naloxone. At discharge, most (74%) individuals were connected to outpatient OUD treatment. Of the total, 35% self-directed their discharge, and there was a higher proportion of self-directed discharges among those who did not receive inpatient MOUD compared with those who did (P < 0.01). Hospitalization during the peripartum period is an important opportunity for initiation of MOUD and linkage to longitudinal, community OUD services. Further understanding of factors contributing to high rates of self-directed discharge in the peripartum period is needed.",Journal of addiction medicine,2025-06-23,10.1097/ADM.0000000000001523,Shelby A Powers,Rebecca Lumsden,N/A,N/A,"medications for opioid use disorder, opioid use, pregnancy"
40555701,Risk factors for development of diabetic foot ulcer disease in two large contemporary UK cohorts.,"Diabetic foot ulcer disease (DFUD) is common, life-changing and associated with a lower 5-Year survival rate than many cancers. However, the risk factors for DFUD have generally been identified in small, single-centre, clinic-based studies, many of which are cross-sectional. This study aims to assess the incidence of DFUD and its related risk factors in two large, contemporary UK cohorts. We investigated common sociodemographic and clinical factors affecting the incidence rates of DFUD in two large representative independent cohorts of people with diabetes in England (CPRD, n = 131 042) and Scotland (Scottish Diabetes Research Network-National Diabetes Dataset [SDRN-NDS] n = 260 748). The methods of case ascertainment differed between the two cohorts: in England, both primary and secondary care data were used, whereas in Scotland, secondary care and foot clinic data were used. In the English cohort, 4.7% developed DFUD over a median of 4.3years (incidence rate 9.0[95%CI: 8.8-9.2] per 1000 person-years) follow-up; in the Scottish cohort, the equivalent figure was 2.9% over a median of 6.3 years (incidence rate 4.4 [95% CI: 4.3-4.5] per 1000 person-years). Despite different methods of case ascertainment, multivariable analysis in both populations indicated that those who developed DFUD were more likely to be older, male, smokers, of White ethnicity, with higher systolic blood pressure and baseline HbA1c. These findings provide a robust evidence base for identifying people with diabetes at risk of DFUD for targeted efforts for prevention.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2025-06-24,10.1111/dom.16519,Safoora Gharibzadeh,Edward Gregg,"Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Leicester, UK.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, Leicester, UK, University of Glasgow, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; SCHARR, Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research, Division of Population Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; SCHARR, Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research, Division of Population Health, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Campus, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Derby, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; NHS Tayside, Scotland Dundee, UK, Scotland, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Division of Clinical Medicine, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Diabetes Research Unit, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Diabetes Research Centre, College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Centre for Population Health Sciences, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Leicester, UK.; National Institute for Health Research Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, UK.; Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, Leicester General Hospital, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; School of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Clarice Pears Building, Level 5 90 Byres Road, Glasgow, UK.; School of Population Health, RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dublin, Ireland.",N/A,"cardiovascular disease, diabetes complications, real‐world evidence, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes"

40569592,Receipt of Buprenorphine and Naltrexone for Opioid Use Disorder by Race and Ethnicity and Insurance Type.,"Despite expanded efforts to improve treatment access, inequities exist in the receipt of medications for opioid use disorder by race and ethnicity and insurance type. To examine inequities in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-specifically buprenorphine and naltrexone-by race and ethnicity and insurance type after opioid-related health care events. This retrospective cohort study used data from the Institute for Health Equity Research Multi-Payor Claims Database, which includes more than 130 million individuals across commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage insurance plans. The cohort consisted of patients aged 18 years or older with an opioid use disorder (OUD)-related health care event (opioid-related overdose, infection, or treatment event) that occurred between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 2023 to December 2024. Race and ethnicity and insurance type, including commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage, were the primary exposures. The primary outcome was receipt of MOUD (buprenorphine or naltrexone) within 180 days of an OUD-related health care event. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of MOUD receipt with race and ethnicity and with insurance type, adjusting for demographic, clinical, time, and geographical covariates. Among 176 997 index events involving 164 728 patients between 2017 and 2022, the mean (SD) patient age was 40.0 (13.1) years; 104 005 (58.8%) involved men; 1083 events (0.6%) were among Asian patients, 23 424 (13.2%) were among Black patients, 10 302 (5.8%) were among Hispanic patients, 90 124 (50.9%) were among White patients, and 4697 (2.7%) were among patients of other race and ethnicity; and 147 257 (83.2%) were covered by Medicaid. Black (adjusted estimated probability, 17.1% [95% CI, 13.0%-21.1%]) and Hispanic (adjusted estimated probability, 16.2% [95% CI, 11.6%-20.8%]) patients were significantly less likely than White patients (adjusted estimated probability, 20.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-24.7%]) to receive buprenorphine (Black patients: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90]; adjusted risk difference [ARD], -3.4 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, -6.5 to -0.4 pp]; Hispanic patients: AOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.92]; ARD, -4.4 pp [95% CI, -9.1 to 0.4 pp]) but received naltrexone at similar rates. Patients with Medicaid (AOR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.14-1.69]; ARD, 3.5 pp [95% CI, 0.9-6.1 pp]) or Medicare Advantage (AOR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]; ARD, 3.6 pp [95% CI, -0.6 to 7.7 pp]) were more likely to receive buprenorphine compared with those with commercial insurance. Buprenorphine access improved incrementally from 2017 to 2022, reflecting recent clinical and policy changes; however, disparities persisted. In this cohort study of more than 17 600 opioid-related index health care events, race and ethnicity-based and insurance-based disparities in access to MOUD persisted despite efforts to expand treatment availability. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including culturally tailored care, expanded access points, and policy reforms to address structural barriers and reduce inequities contributing to the overdose crisis.",JAMA network open,2025-06-02,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.18493,Utsha G Khatri,Ka Ming Ngai,"Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Institute for Health Equity Research, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.","Humans, Buprenorphine, Naltrexone, Male, Female, Opioid-Related Disorders, United States, Retrospective Studies, Middle Aged, Adult, Healthcare Disparities, Ethnicity, Narcotic Antagonists, Opiate Substitution Treatment, Medicaid, Insurance, Health, Racial Groups, Medicare Part C, Health Services Accessibility",N/A
40569596,Availability of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Opioid Treatment Programs.,"As the primary facilities authorized to dispense methadone, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are a critical access point for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, research is limited on the extent to which OTPs offer a broad range of MOUD and on the characteristics of programs that provide more comprehensive medication offerings. To assess the percentage of US OTPs offering all 3 forms of MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) and compare organizational and county characteristics of OTPs with different MOUD service offerings. This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data on a panel of OTPs listed in the annual National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Use Treatment Facilities from 2017 to 2023. Measures included the percentage of OTPs offering buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, or all 3 MOUD from 2017 to 2023 (assuming all OTPs offered methadone). Descriptive statistics on organizational and county characteristics of OTPs by MOUD offerings were collected. Three longitudinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of different MOUD offerings within OTPs, adjusting for organizational and county-level characteristics. This analysis included 10 298 facility-year observations, ranging from 1211 in 2017 to 1421 in 2023. From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of OTPs offering MOUD beyond methadone increased (buprenorphine: 811 [67.0%] in 2017 to 1209 [85.1%] in 2023; naltrexone: 463 [38.2%] in 2017 to 749 [52.7%] in 2023; all 3 MOUD: 402 [33.2%] in 2017 to 639 [45.0%] in 2023). OTPs offering all 3 MOUD (3985 [38.7%]) had significantly higher odds of accepting Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.67-2.74); offering peer services (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25-2.12), mental health services (AOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.80), and telemedicine services (AOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92); and being private nonprofit (AOR, 7.45; 95% CI, 4.67-11.87) or government operated (AOR, 41.83; 95% CI, 19.71-88.75) compared with private for profit. In this cross-sectional study of OTPs, although the availability of MOUD beyond methadone increased over time, most OTPs still did not offer all 3 forms of MOUD as of 2023. Specific organizational characteristics, such as being government operated and accepting Medicare, were associated with more comprehensive MOUD offerings.

40569933,Trends of long-term opioid therapy and subsequent discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain in UK primary care: A retrospective cohort study.,"To examine trends of opioid use, focusing on long-term opioid therapy (L-TOT) and its discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Retrospective cohort study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum data. Incident opioid users (no opioid use in the prior year) with CNCP between 01/01/2009-31/12/2019. Among them, we identified L-TOT users (≥3 opioid prescriptions within 90 days, or total ≥90 supply days within the first year, excluding the initial 30 days) and L-TOT discontinuers (no opioid use for ≥180 days following a L-TOT). Yearly rates of incident opioid users (over CPRD-registered patients), L-TOT users (over incident opioid users), and L-TOT discontinuers (over L-TOT users) were calculated. Annual counts of each group were fitted using segmented negative binomial regression models with an offset considering their corresponding denominators from 2009 to 2019, excluding 2014 due to policy changes in that year. Among 2,839,161 incident opioid users, 11.4% (n = 324,877) transitioned into L-TOT users within one year, of which 4.8% (n = 15,484) discontinued. Between 2009-2013, rates of L-TOT users significantly declined by 2.6% (incidence rate ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.971 to 0.978) per annum, followed by a significant step change in 2015 (1.026, 1.009 to1.044), and a significant annual increase of 2.4% (1.024, 1.019 to 1.029) from 2015 to 2019, compared to the 2009-2013 trend. The annual rates of L-TOT discontinuers remained stable from 2009 to 2013 (0.987, 0.971 to 1.002), followed by a non-significant step change (0.990, 0.916 to 1.070) in 2015, and a significant decrease in slope by 2.6% (0.974, 0.951 to 0.998) per annum during 2015-2019, relative to 2009-2013. L-TOT has plateaued since 2015, accompanied with an accelerated decrease in discontinuation rates, suggesting ongoing reliance on opioids for CNCP management, despite increased awareness regarding L-TOT associated risks. This is likely due to the limited availability of other effective pharmacological options and non-pharmacological alternatives, and challenges in their accessibility.",PloS one,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0326604,Qian Cai,Evangelos Kontopantelis,"Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Population Health, Health Services Research & Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; NIHR Greater Manchester Patient Safety Research Collaboration, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Division of Informatics, Imaging & Data Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.","Humans, Analgesics, Opioid, Retrospective Studies, Female, United Kingdom, Male, Chronic Pain, Middle Aged, Primary Health Care, Aged, Adult, Opioid-Related Disorders",N/A
40577006,Postpartum Medicaid Use in Birthing Parents and Access to Financed Care.,"The American Rescue Plan of 2021 allowed states to expand pregnancy Medicaid coverage to 12 months post partum. How the new policy affects Medicaid coverage and health care utilization is largely unknown. To quantify insurance coverage and care utilization for postpartum individuals under Medicaid policies that extended postpartum coverage to 12 months after delivery from 60 days. A retrospective study of Medicaid coverage and utilization in North Carolina using Medicaid claims from March 2016 to December 2023 was conducted. All Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022 were included. A total of 3 periods were differentiated: before the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), during the PHE when there was a moratorium on Medicaid disenrollment, and after North Carolina adopted the 12-month postpartum extension through the American Rescue Plan of 2021. Length and type of postpartum Medicaid enrollment were evaluated. Utilization outcomes included indicators of (1) the receipt of at least 1 postpartum visit; (2) any contraceptive visit; (3) any primary care visit; (4) any outpatient mental health care, and (5) any outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) care. There were 353 957 Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022. During the postpartum extension, Medicaid recipients were more likely to have been continuously covered by comprehensive Medicaid at 12 months post partum (97.1% vs 26.5% pre-PHE). Beneficiaries in the extended coverage cohorts were substantially more likely to use Medicaid-financed care than those in the pre-PHE cohort for contraception (47.8% for the PHE cohort and 47.9% for the extension cohort vs 38.0% for the pre-PHE cohort), primary care (68.1% for the PHE cohort and 71.4% for the extension cohort vs 25.3% for the pre-PHE cohort), mental health (22.1% for the PHE cohort and 25.7% for the extension cohort vs 7.5% for the pre-PHE cohort) and substance use disorder visits (3.6% for the PHE cohort and 5.3% for the extension cohort vs 2.2%for the pre-PHE cohort) within 12 months, although there was evidence of delays in early postpartum and contraceptive visits. Results of this study suggest that extending Medicaid coverage for 12 months post partum was associated with expanded opportunities for greater access to Medicaid-financed medical and behavioral health care. Both prevention and ongoing treatment of chronic conditions may help mitigate key adverse outcomes. Findings may help policymakers and public health officials understand how extended coverage affects access to Medicaid-financed care.",JAMA health forum,2025-06-07,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1630,Jonas J Swartz,Marisa Elena Domino,"Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.; Duke-Margolis Institute for Health Policy, Durham, North Carolina.; Cecil G.

The Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium (TKCC) database was used to extract retrospective data from patients with metastatic RCC treated with nivolumab in the second line and beyond. Patients were evaluated according to their smoking status. A total of 247 patients were evaluated. The majority of the current smokers were male (93.8%, p=0.002).

40578797,Potential impact of peer support service on SUD treatment engagement following ED visits among Kentucky medicaid beneficiaries.,"Research indicates that peer support has a positive impact on patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Despite promising findings, integrating peer support into SUD treatment remains limited, particularly during the critical transition period between emergency department (ED) discharge and treatment initiation. This study examines the effectiveness of Kentucky-certified Peer Support Specialists (PSS) during that period within a Medicaid population. We conducted a retrospective analysis of beneficiaries with SUD who initiated treatment following an ED visit using Kentucky Medicaid claims data from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We assessed prior health conditions using 12-month lookback period (July 2021-June 2022). We then compared monthly engagement outcomes between beneficiaries who received PSS and those who did not. PSS was consistently associated with higher odds of treatment engagement across six months. In unadjusted logistic regression models, odds ratios (ORs) for the PSS group ranged from 1.75 (95 % CI: 1.45-2.09) to 4.17 (95 % CI: 3.53-4.91). Adjusted models accounting for age, sex, geographic location, and health conditions yielded ORs between 1.63 (95 % CI: 1.35-1.95) and 3.84 (95 % CI: 3.23-4.55). Subgroup analysis by sex showed that females receiving PSS had ORs ranging from 1.50 (95 % CI: 1.10-2.05) to 3.77 (95 % CI: 2.80-5.07), while males showed ORs from 1.70 (95 % CI: 1.43-2.14) to 4.22 (95 % CI: 3.43-5.22). Among those with one health condition, PSS effects ranged from Month 1 (OR = 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.95) to a peak in Month 2 (OR = 4.51, 95 % CI: 3.32-6.13). For those with two conditions, effects increased from Month 1 (OR = 1.76, 95 % CI: 1.33-2.34) to a peak in Month 3 (OR = 4.21, 95 % CI: 3.25-5.45). In the group with three or more conditions, ORs started at 2.49 (95 % CI: 1.43-4.32) and remained high through Month 6 (OR = 3.46, 95 % CI: 2.18-5.48). Peer support services are associated with the increased likelihood of SUD engagement in Kentucky Medicaid enrollees.

40581187,"Impact of telehealth, in-person, and hybrid care modalities on buprenorphine discontinuation among patients with opioid use disorder: A retrospective cohort study on commercially insured individuals.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for OUD, but its benefits rely on sustained treatment retention. The expansion of telehealth and hybrid care models, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, provides an opportunity to improve retention. However, the comparative effectiveness of these care modalities on buprenorphine discontinuation across different treatment phases remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study utilized IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims data from September 2019 to December 2022. The study included insured individuals aged ≥18 years diagnosed with OUD who initiated buprenorphine treatment between March 23, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Patients were stratified into telehealth, in-person, and hybrid care (initiating treatment via telehealth and receiving 51-75 % of visits in-person) groups. The primary outcome was buprenorphine discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days in prescription fills/refills during the 12-month follow-up. Discontinuation was assessed as two separate binary outcomes: (1) early-phase discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days within the first 3 months of treatment, and (2) late-phase discontinuation, defined as a gap of ≥30 days between months 4 and 12 among those who remained on treatment through the initial 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were applied for each outcome, and propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to minimize confounding. Among 10,783 patients (mean age 43.25 ± 12.62 years; 49.52 % female), those treated via telehealth were significantly less likely to discontinue buprenorphine during the early treatment phase compared to patients in both in-person and hybrid care groups (OR: 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.75-0.92). During the late treatment phase, patients receiving hybrid care had significantly lower odds of discontinuation compared to those receiving either telehealth or in-person care (OR: 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.62-0.86). These findings were consistent in both unmatched and matched analyses. Telehealth was associated with improved early retention in buprenorphine treatment, while hybrid care models were more effective for long-term retention. The findings suggest that a phased approach, where telehealth is leveraged for treatment initiation and early retention, and when the patient continues via a hybrid model for long-term care, may optimize buprenorphine treatment outcomes.",Journal of substance use and addiction treatment,2025-06-26,10.1016/j.josat.2025.209749,Jabed Al Faysal,Md Mahmudul Hasan,"Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA; D'Amore-McKim School of Business, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

Using the TriNetX health network database, we evaluated postoperative complications and additional procedures of patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction over a 20-year period. Patients with a documented mental health disorder (e.g., anxiety or depression) within 1 year preceding surgery were compared to patients without mental health disorders. The cohorts were propensity-matched for demographic and medical factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated within 90 days and 3 years postoperative, respectively. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare outcomes between the 2 cohorts. A total of 8,351 patients with diagnosed mental health disorders were propensity-score matched at a 1:1 ratio with 82,127 patients without diagnosed mental health disorders. Within 90 days postoperative, patients with diagnosed mental health disorders demonstrated significantly higher odds of postoperative infection (P = 0.0042), lower limb mononeuropathy (P = 0.025), acute postoperative pain (P < 0.0001), knee stiffness (P < 0.0001), and any emergency department visit (P < 0.0001).

Patients undergoing thyroidectomy were identified using the TriNetX Research Platform (2010-2024). Cohorts were divided based on opioid prescriptions on the day of surgery. With propensity score matching to prevent confounding bias, risk ratios were calculated for opioid prescriptions 3-9 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included ED presentation, pain diagnosis, and lifetime risk of opioid use disorder, defined as significant social dysfunction due to uncontrolled use. The post-match opioid group (n = 19,727) experienced a 4.61% risk of POU (control: 4.07%), representing a 14% higher risk of POU compared to the non-opioid group (RR 1.14, 95% CI: [1.03, 1.25]). Opioids slightly decreased the likelihood of outpatient visits at 30 days (RR: 0.97 [0.95, 0.98]) and 90 days (RR: 0.96 [0.94, 0.97]) following surgery. There were no significant differences in ED presentation, pain diagnoses at 30 and 90 days, or lifetime OUD risk.

This retrospective study evaluated the incidence, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of psoriasis patients with active TB who had received topical or systemic treatments. Medical records from 13 066 psoriasis patients who presented at Siriraj Hospital over 18 years were reviewed. Among these, 86 (0.66%) developed active TB, yielding an incidence range of 135-1332 per 100 000 psoriasis patients. The mean patient age was 50.4 ± 15.7 years; 63 were men and 23 were women. Pulmonary TB occurred in 55 patients (64.0%), whereas 31 (36.0%) developed extrapulmonary TB. Male sex and smoking were associated with pulmonary TB. The most common pulmonary symptoms were chronic cough (65.5%) and dyspnoea (60.0%), although 7.3% were asymptomatic. Time to TB onset was shorter for extrapulmonary cases (5.7 ± 5.1 years) than for pulmonary cases (7.4 ± 6.5 years), but this difference was not statistically significant. Extrapulmonary disease most frequently involved the lymph node and pleura (25.8%) or the gastrointestinal tract (16.1%). Notably, all four patients who received infliximab within 1 year before TB diagnosis developed extrapulmonary TB. In conclusion, the incidence of TB in psoriasis patients in endemic regions may be high. Geographic factors, sex, smoking, and treatment history appear to influence TB risk.

40599969,Expansion of Telehealth Availability for Mental Health Care After State-Level Policy Changes From 2019 to 2022.,"Although telehealth services expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the association between state policies and telehealth availability has been insufficiently characterized. To investigate the associations between 4 state policies and telehealth availability at outpatient mental health treatment facilities throughout the US. This cohort study measured whether mental health treatment facilities offered telehealth services each quarter from April 2019 through September 2022. The sample comprised facilities with outpatient services that were not part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs system. Four state policies were identified from 4 different sources. Data were analyzed in January 2023. For each quarter, implementation of the following policies was indexed by state: (1) payment parity for telehealth services among private insurers; (2) authorization of audio-only telehealth services for Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries; (3) participation in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC), permitting psychiatrists to provide telehealth services across state lines; and (4) participation in the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), permitting clinical psychologists to provide telehealth services across state lines. The primary outcome was the probability of a mental health treatment facility offering telehealth services in each quarter for each study year (2019-2022). Information on the facilities was obtained from the Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Tracking Repository based on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Behavioral Health Treatment Service Locator. Separate multivariable fixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the difference in the probability of offering telehealth services after vs before policy implementation, adjusting for characteristics of the facility and county in which the facility was located. A total of 12 828 mental health treatment facilities were included. Overall, 88.1% of facilities offered telehealth services in September 2022 compared with 39.4% of facilities in April 2019. All 4 policies were associated with increased odds of telehealth availability: payment parity for telehealth services (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19), reimbursement for audio-only telehealth services (AOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.64-1.81), IMLC participation (AOR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.24-1.59), and PSYPACT participation (AOR, 1.21, 95% CI, 1.12-1.31). Facilities that accepted Medicaid as a form of payment had lower odds of offering telehealth services (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.86) over the study period, as did facilities in counties with a higher proportion (>20%) of Black residents (AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.50-0.68). Facilities in rural counties had higher odds of offering telehealth services (AOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.48-1.88). Results of this study suggest that 4 state policies that were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with marked expansion of telehealth availability for mental health care at mental health treatment facilities throughout the US. Despite these policies, telehealth services were less likely to be offered in counties with a greater proportion of Black residents and in facilities that accepted Medicaid and CHIP.Appeared originally in",Focus (American Psychiatric Publishing),2025-07-01,10.1176/appi.focus.25023019,Ryan K McBain,Jonathan H Cantor,"Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (McBain); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia (McBain, Schuler, Kofner); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California (Qureshi, Matthews, Cantor); Division of Healthcare Delivery, RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Breslau).",N/A,N/A
40604652,"Trends in cocaine use and cocaine-related harms in Ireland: a retrospective, multi-source database study.","Increased cocaine supply has coincided with increased global cocaine use. In 2019 Ireland had one of the highest last-year rates of cocaine use in Europe. However, there is a lack of data on the health-related impacts of cocaine use in European countries over time. This retrospective, multi-source database study utilised data from national databases to evaluate the following time trends: (1) prevalence of cocaine use; (2) number of cocaine-related hospital discharges; (3) number of cocaine-related psychiatric hospital admissions; (4) treatment demand for problem cocaine use; and (5) cocaine-related deaths. Joinpoint regression was used to examine change points over time and average annual percentage changes (AAPCs). Last-year cocaine use among 15-64-year-olds increased from 1·1% in 2002/03 to 2·4% in 2022/23. The number of cocaine-related acute hospital discharges per 100,000 population increased from 1·4 in 2000 to 24·3 in 2023 (AAPC: 13·0%; 95% CI: 11·95, 14·84), and psychiatric hospitalisations increased from 0·2 in 2000 to 2·4 in 2022 (AAPC: 11·1%; 95% CI: 9·41, 15·48). Treatment entrants reporting cocaine as a main problem drug increased from 1·5 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 93·2 in 2023 (AAPC: 17·6%; 95% CI: 15·89, 20·74), while cocaine-related deaths increased from 0·3 in 2000 to 5·6 in 2020 (AAPC: 16·9%; 95% CI: 14·71, 21·70). In general, rates of harm increased from 2000 to 2007, decreased until 2011-2013, and since 2013 have increased significantly and consistently.

40604906,Association between neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio and prevalence and mortality of diabetes: a cross-sectional study.,"Inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism play critical roles in diabetes development. This study explored the association between the neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) and diabetes prevalence and mortality. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. The correlation between NHR and the prevalence of diabetes was evaluated using logistic regression models. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to investigate whether NHR related to the risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular diseases. A series of sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. Among the 52,428 study participants, 8,114 (15.48%) had diabetes, with a mean neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) of 3.49. In the full-adjusted model, each unit increase in NHR was related to a 17.0% higher risk of diabetes (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI 1.13-1.21], P < 0.001). Results were similar when participants were categorized by NHR tertiles (odds ratio, 2.08 [95% CI 1.76-2.47], comparing extreme quartiles). The stratified analyses showed that the association between NHR and risk of diabetes was more obvious in female, White, former smokers and participants with age ≥ 50 years. After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9.42 (5.08-14.33) years, higher NHR levels were positively associated with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in diabetes patients. A series of sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. Elevated NHR is linked to higher diabetes prevalence and increased mortality risk in a U.S. population, independent of traditional risk factors. Regular monitoring of NHR may serve as an easy-to-measure tool for risk stratification for diabetes and its adverse outcomes.

Compare baseline characteristics and 6-month ER visits and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) across treatment groups. Patient claims data from September 2017- March 2022 were analyzed for patients diagnosed with OUD and/or treated with buprenorphine. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with ER visits 6-months post-index. 543 patients initiating BUP-XR, 52,569 BUP-TM and 57,125 patients with OUD diagnosis but no-medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) were identified.Patients who received BUP-XR (OR: 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.36-0.53) or BUP-TM (OR: 0.78; CI: 0.76-0.81) had lower odds for an all-cause post-index ER visit compared to those with no MOUD treatment.Patients with later index years or those who had an opioid overdose ER visit in the baseline period had higher odds of post-index all-cause and opioid overdose ER visits.1.2 % in BUP-TM cohort and 1 % in the no MOUD cohort had an opioid overdose ER visit, compared to 0 % in the BUP-XR cohort. The BUP-XR cohort had lower rates of inpatient stays, ER visits, and outpatient physician office visits compared to the BUP-TM and no MOUD cohorts but incurred higher pharmacy costs. This study found that any buprenorphine treatment, particularly BUP-XR, was associated with lower odds of all-cause ER visits compared to patients with no MOUD, and highlighted potential risk factors that could help reduce the demand on ER services.",Drug and alcohol dependence reports,2025-09-01,10.1016/j.dadr.2025.100349,Sabrina Gaiazov,Robert Dunne,"Indivior Inc., Medical Affairs, Richmond, VA, USA.; Indivior Inc., Medical Affairs, Richmond, VA, USA.; Indivior Inc., Medical Affairs, Richmond, VA, USA.; IQVIA Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Falls Church, VA, USA.; IQVIA Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Falls Church, VA, USA.; IQVIA Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Falls Church, VA, USA.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.",N/A,"Buprenorphine, Emergency room visits, Medication for opioid use disorder, Opioid overdose, Opioid use disorder, Patient costs, Synthetic opioids"
40610254,Multimorbidity Profiles and Cause-Specific Mortality Among Older Adults with Schizophrenia.,"To characterize multimorbidity patterns among mid- to late-life adults with schizophrenia and evaluate the relationship between multimorbidity patterns and cause-specific mortality. This study utilized a national, longitudinal, cohort of U.S. veterans aged 50 years and older with schizophrenia who were followed 2012-2020 (n = 91,680). Latent class analysis was used to identify multimorbidity profiles of medical and neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Demographic variables and diagnoses were extracted from the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Patient Care Database and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data. Information on cause-specific mortality was drawn from the VA Mortality Data Repository. Fine-Gray models were used to examine associations between multimorbidity classes and incident mortality over the study period, including death due to natural causes, unintentional injury, and suicide. Four multimorbidity classes were identified: Minimal Multimorbidity (52%), high anxiety/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (19%), psychiatric and substance use disorder (SUD) (19%), and high Medical-Psychiatric (11%). The high Medical-Psychiatric class had the highest risk of overall mortality during the study period (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.97-2.09 versus Minimal Multimorbidity), with the most common causes of death due to heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The psychiatry and SUD class had the highest risk of death due to unintentional injury (HR 2.24, 95% CI 2.00-2.51). The High Anxiety/PTSD group had the highest risk of suicide death (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.77). Older veterans with schizophrenia are a heterogeneous group with distinct multimorbidity patterns and associated causes of mortality.

40610285,Association of peripheral nerve blocks with increased postoperative pain and opioid use in orthopaedic surgery: a single-centre retrospective cohort study.,"Peripheral nerve blocks have become popular in orthopaedic surgeries to improve acute postoperative pain. However, studies are mixed on their effectiveness in decreasing postoperative opioid consumption. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to understand if peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative opioid exposure and risk for opioid dependence. This retrospective cohort study evaluated electronic health record data for adults undergoing orthopaedic surgery with general anaesthesia from 2016 to 2020 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Linear models were fitted on propensity-weighted data to characterise the association between single injection peripheral nerve blocks and clinical outcomes. Our primary outcomes were maximum pain score and cumulative opioid dose, quantified in morphine milligram equivalents, administered in the PACU. Post-discharge outcomes associated with pain and opioid consumption were also evaluated. Among 22 956 patients, peripheral nerve block administration was associated with lower maximum pain scores and lower probability of opioid administration in the PACU. However, it was associated with higher maximum pain scores and a 22.7% increase in opioid consumption during the hospital stay. Peripheral nerve blocks were associated with an increase in opioid prescriptions at 30 days after discharge, but no increase at 90 or 180 days, and with decreased chronic pain diagnoses 1 yr after operation. Although single injection peripheral nerve blocks were effective in reducing immediate postoperative pain and opioid consumption, they were associated with greater opioid consumption that could increase the risk for opioid dependence. Standardised protocols to mitigate the risk for rebound pain could help minimise postoperative opioid exposure.",British journal of anaesthesia,2025-07-02,10.1016/j.bja.2025.05.030,Ashley R Chung,Patrick L Purdon,"Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Harvard/MIT MD-PhD Program, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard/MIT Program in Health, Sciences, and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

40611139,Associations of socioeconomic status and health lifestyles with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: two nationwide population-based studies.,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, with smoking and poor diet as major contributing factors. However, the impact of a comprehensive healthy lifestyle as a potential mediator between SES and COPD risk remains understudied. This study analyzed data from 32,836 US adults in the NHANES (1999-2020) and 131,872 UK adults in the UK Biobank. SES was assessed via latent class analysis based on income, education, employment, and health insurance (NHANES). SES was categorized into high, middle, and low levels. Healthy lifestyle scores included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Weighted multivariable logistic regression (NHANES) and Cox proportional hazards models (UK Biobank) were used to assess the associations between SES and the prevalence (NHANES) or incidence (UK Biobank) of COPD. In the UK Biobank, the incidences of newly diagnosed COPD in the high-, medium-, and low-SES groups were 1.27%, 2.92%, and 6.57%, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the prevalence rates of COPD were 2.55%, 2.53%, and 4.50%, respectively. Compared with the highest SES group, a low SES was a risk factor for both the incidence and prevalence of COPD (UK Biobank: HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.98 to 3.58; NHANES: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.10). The percentages of the mediation effect of a healthy lifestyle in the UK Biobank and US NHANES were 2.81% and 37.27%, respectively. Additionally, compared with those in the group with the highest SES and the healthiest lifestyle, the risk of COPD incidence and prevalence increased by 950% (HR = 10.50, 95% CI = 9.04 to 12.20) and 641% (OR = 7.41, 95% CI = 5.10 to 10.78), respectively, in the group with the lowest SES and the unhealthiest lifestyle. Risk factor analysis for COPD revealed that, in addition to a low SES (HR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.39 to 2.72; OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.46) and unhealthy lifestyle (HR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.73 to 3.12; OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.13 to 4.57), smoking (HR = 5.23, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.61; OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 3.23 to 4.59) was the most significant risk factor for COPD. Low SES significantly contributes to COPD risk, but a healthy lifestyle mediating this association. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices and addressing socioeconomic disparities are essential public health strategies for COPD prevention. Additionally, smoking cessation and increased early screening in smokers are strongly recommended.",BMC public health,2025-07-03,10.1186/s12889-025-23568-5,Siying Liu,Yongze Li,"Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism and the Institute of Endocrinology, NHC Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Thyroid Diseases, First Hospital of China Medical University, No. 155, Nanjing Bei Street, Shenyang, 110001, P.

Utilizing cross-sectional data from 18,500 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005-2018 cycle), we developed a composite exposure model integrating BDoH (smoking status, physical activity, dietary quality) and MDoH (obesity metrics, hypertension, diabetes) through standardized questionnaires and clinical measurements. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were calculated from peripheral blood cell counts. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined dose-response relationships, with trend analysis explicitly testing cumulative BDoH-MDoH interactions.

40618656,Risk of drug-related mortality among people receiving opioid-agonist treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in delivery of opioid-agonist treatment (OAT) and risk of drug-related harm in Scotland. This study aimed to (i) examine changes in drug-related death (DRD) rates and the protective effect of OAT during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland (2020-2022) compared with the previous decade (2011-2019); and (ii) describe trends in OAT prescribing over the same period. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Scottish national Prescribing Information System linked to healthcare and administrative data from Public Health Scotland. The cohort included individuals prescribed OAT (methadone or buprenorphine). We examined trends in OAT prescribing, calculated crude DRD rates per 1000 person-years, and used multivariable quasi-Poisson regression to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) for DRD risk across four time periods (2011-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2019, and 2020-2022). Between 2011 and 2022, 49,000 individuals accessed OAT, contributing 366,344 person years of follow-up, during which 5255 DRDs occurred. In the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-2022), 34,241 people received OAT and there were 1825 DRDs. DRD rates increased steadily prior to 2020, but remained stable during the pandemic: the observed DRD rate during 2020-2022 was comparable to 2017-2019 (aIRR=0.96, 95 % CI=0.80, 1.15). Across all periods, being on OAT was consistently associated with a lower risk of DRD compared to being off treatment (aIRR=3.47, 95 % CI=2.98, 4.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, DRD rates remained stable following a three-fold rise since 2011-13.

40622248,Trends in Substance Use Disorder Among Hospitalized Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An 11-Year Nationwide Study.,"We described the temporal trend of substance use disorder (SUD) and SUD subtypes among patients hospitalized with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), accounting for readmissions within the calendar year. One in six patients with IBD is estimated to have a concomitant SUD. SUD has had mounting morbidity and mortality rates since 2010 and has been shown to adversely affect IBD activity. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized at least once with IBD from 2010 through 2020 using the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis evaluated associations between SUD and age, sex, insurance type, income for the ZIP Code, and geographic region. Of 2,532,450 patients hospitalized with IBD, 26.5% and 17.0% involved SUD in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. Between 2010 and 2020, the prevalence of patients with SUD increased from 23.8% to 27.9% in CD (Ptrend<0.001) and 14.2% to 19.4% in UC (Ptrend<0.001). Rates of alcohol, opioid, and cannabis use disorders increased (Ptrend<0.001 for all). Patients with SUD were more likely to be male [CD: OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.24-1.27; UC: 1.34, (1.31-1.36)], have Medicaid insurance compared with Medicare [CD: 1.59, (1.55-1.63); UC: 1.84, (1.78-1.90)], and be in a lower income quartile [lowest to highest quartile, CD: 1.54, (1.51-1.58); UC: 1.56, (1.52-1.61)]. SUD among IBD patients continued to increase over time, with the predominant substances used shifting from alcohol to opioids and cannabis. Rates of SUD among patients hospitalized with CD were consistently higher than those with UC or with non-IBD-related hospitalizations.",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2025-07-02,10.1097/MCG.0000000000002205,Melanie Zheng,Berkeley N Limketkai,"Department of Medicine.; Vatche and Tamar Manoukian Division of Digestive Diseases, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.; Department of Medicine, Division of Addiction Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.; Vatche and Tamar Manoukian Division of Digestive Diseases, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA.",N/A,"alcohol use, cannabis use, opioid use, substance use disorder"
40623259,Administrative Claims Data Show Increased Morbidity Risk For US Adults In Same-Sex Versus Different-Sex Relationships.,"Studies have found that sexual minority populations more often report worse overall health, lower health-related quality of life, and greater risk for disability than their heterosexual counterparts. This study used a novel approach to identify people in same-sex relationships, using insurance administrative claims data, and compared the prevalence of morbidity in that population with its prevalence in the population of those in different-sex relationships. This observational retrospective cohort study used the Merative MarketScan Research Database, which pooled data from private insurers from the period 2016-22. We identified 340,728 people in same-sex relationships, making this one of the largest studies on sexual minority populations to date, and found that they had higher Elixhauser morbidity scores than their counterparts in different-sex relationships. Sexual minorities experienced a greater prevalence of mental health morbidities (that is, depression, psychoses, and alcohol and drug use disorders) than their peers in different-sex relationships, with adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) ranging from 1.23 to 2.07. Sexual minority men also were more likely to have HIV (PRR: 93.62) and lymphoma (PRR: 1.34) than their male counterparts in different-sex relationships. These findings support the survey literature that has documented that sexual minority populations experience greater mental health and HIV-related morbidity, and they offer a novel approach to identifying members of sexual minorities.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2025-07-01,10.1377/hlthaff.2024.01014,Landon Hughes,Brittany M Charlton,"Landon Hughes (LHughes@hsph.harvard.edu), Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Gilbert Gonzales, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Sarah McKetta, Harvard University.; Alex McDowell, Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brittany M.

40623817,"Transporting the effect of the ASSIST school-based smoking prevention intervention to the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People in England Survey (2004-2021): A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.","To conduct exploratory analyses into the transported effect of the ASSIST (A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial) school-based smoking prevention intervention on weekly smoking in young people between 2004 and 2021. Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT). England and Wales. ASSIST trial participants comprised 8756 students aged 12-13 years in 59 schools assigned using stratified block randomization to the control (29 schools, 4193 students) or intervention (30 schools, 4563 students) condition. The target population was represented by 12-13-year-old participants in the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use Among Young People in England Survey (SDDU) in 2004 (n = 3958), 2006 (n = 3377), 2014 (n = 3145), 2016 (n = 4874) and 2021 (n = 3587), which are randomly sampled school-based surveys with student response rates varying between 85% and 93%. The ASSIST intervention involved 2 days of off-site training of influential students to encourage their peers not to smoke over a 10-week period. The control group continued with their usual education. The outcome was the proportion of students who self-reported weekly smoking 2 years post-intervention. The prevalence of weekly smoking at the 2-year follow-up in the ASSIST trial in 2004 was 4.1%, 49.5% of students were girls, and 7.8% ethnic minorities. In the SDDU in 2004, the prevalence of weekly smoking was 3.6%, 47.6% students were girls and 14.4% ethnic minorities and in 2021 0.2% were weekly smokers, 48.6% girls and 27.8% ethnic minorities. The odds ratio of weekly smoking in the ASSIST trial in 2004 was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.71-1.02]. The estimated odds ratio in the SDDU target population in 2004 was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.72-1.13), in 2014 was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.70-1.14), and by 2021 was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.60-1.28). The confidence interval ratio was used to estimate precision in the transported estimates in the target population and was 1.57 in 2004, 1.63 in 2014 and 2.13 in 2021, reflecting increasing uncertainty in the effect of ASSIST over time. Subgroup analyses showed effects were comparable when restricted to only English schools in the ASSIST trial. These exploratory analyses indicate the effect of the ASSIST school-based smoking prevention intervention reported in the original trial may not have been replicated in the target population over the 17-year period of its licensing and roll out.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2025-07-07,10.1111/add.70141,James White,James White,"Centre for Trials Research, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.",N/A,"generalizability, prevention, randomized controlled trial, real world evidence, smoking, transportability"
40626143,Does Self-Reported Drug Allergy Influence Clinically Significant Outcome Improvement and Graft Failure Rates After Meniscal Allograft Transplantation of the Knee?,"Emerging research suggests that immune responses may influence results after various orthopaedic operations. This study aimed to determine if similar relationships exist in meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT). To compare clinical outcomes and failure rates for patients who underwent MAT based on presence or absence of self-reported drug allergies. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A retrospective review of patients who underwent MAT from January 2004 to December 2021 at a single academic medical institution was conducted with minimum follow-up of 2 years. Age, sex, body mass index, and presence of concomitant procedures were collected. The presence or absence of patient-reported allergies was recorded from the electronic medical record. Graft failure was defined as removal or revision of primary MAT, subsequent cartilage procedure, or progression to arthroplasty. The Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and all Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were compared for each patient from preoperative to 2-year time points. The minimal clinically important difference was determined using distribution-based method. A total of 107 patients who underwent MAT with minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in the study. Of the total, 22 (20.6%) had self-reported ≥1 medication allergy and 85 (79.4%) did not report any medication allergies. There were no significant differences between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts in other demographic variables. There was no significant difference in failure rate between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts (18.1% vs 8.2%;  The presence of self-reported drug allergies does not appear to adversely affect clinically significant outcome improvement or graft survival rates in patients undergoing MAT. These findings suggest that self-reported allergies should not be considered a limiting factor for MAT and that surgeons can continue to focus on other patient-specific factors that may be more predictive of postoperative outcomes.",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,2025-07-01,10.1177/23259671251344233,Jared P Sachs,Brian J Cole,"Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.",N/A,"clinically significant outcome improvement, graft failure, immune hypersensitivity, meniscal allograft transplantation"

However, understanding of end-of-life (EOL) service use and costs in this population is limited. We aimed to assess EOL healthcare utilisation and costs for First Nations cancer patients in Queensland, Australia. Retrospective data from CancerCostMod, a linked administrative dataset of all cancer diagnoses in Queensland, were used. This dataset includes records from the Queensland Cancer Registry (QCR) from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, linked to Queensland Health Admitted Patient Data Collection (QHAPDC), Emergency Department (ED) Information Systems, Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data from July 2011 to June 30, 2018. All diagnosed cancer patients who had died during the study period (N = 467) were included. Health service usage and costs during the last 6 months of life were described and compared across care type, comorbidity status, age group, and residential remoteness using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Individuals had at least one hospital episode (100%), ED visit (83%), MBS claim (96%), and PBS claim (96%). The median overall cost per person for hospital episodes was AUD$40,996, with higher costs for those receiving palliative care (AUD$43,521) and chemotherapy (AUD$50,437) compared to those who did not receive these services (palliative: AUD$34,208, chemotherapy: AUD$38,557). Having comorbidities and living in regional and remote areas were associated with higher hospital costs.
