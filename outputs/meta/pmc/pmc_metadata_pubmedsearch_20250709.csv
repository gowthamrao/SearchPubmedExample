To address this knowledge gap, especially due to rising patterns of cannabis use and its emerging pharmacological role in cancer. By applying relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes to the National Inpatient Sample database between 2016-2020, we identified CUD(+) and CUD(-) arms among adult cancer admissions with severe sepsis. Comparing the two cohorts, we examined baseline demographic characteristics, epidemiological trends, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, respiratory failure, hospital cost, and length of stay. We used the Pearson  We identified a total of 743520 cancer patients admitted with severe sepsis, of which 4945 had CUD.

PMC11978320,40201330,The impact of increased telehealth use on the treatment of substance use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift from in-person substance use disorder (SUD) treatment to virtual telehealth (TH) visits, creating opportunities to assess the impact of virtual visits on SUD treatment. This study utilized retrospective, de-identified, electronic health record (EHR) data from Oracle EHR Real-World Data to examine the impact of TH on SUD treatment. Patients with a qualifying SUD diagnosis from 141 U.S. health systems were included and divided into pre-TH (January 1, 2017 through January 1, 2019) and COVID (January 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022) cohorts. This study analyzed TH utilization, medications for SUD (MSUD) prescribing, drug-related events, and mental health crises, comparing patient outcomes where the treating clinician was a high TH user versus a low TH user in both pre-COVID and COVID periods. Patients visiting high TH clinicians had lower MSUD prescribing rates, yet a higher MSUD day's supply, and higher rates of TH outpatient visits than those visiting low TH providers, with both groups having an increase in TH visits during the COVID period. Patients with high TH clinicians had lower rates of SUD-related hospitalizations than those with low TH providers but similar rates of drug overdoses, relapses, injection-related infections, and mental health crises. TH modalities showed increased SUD-related outpatient visits without increasing adverse outcomes, indicating its potential as a sustainable alternative to in-person care. This study highlights the need for further research on TH efficacy for SUD-specific populations and supports the continued integration of telehealth in SUD treatment post-pandemic.  Telehealth use for SUD treatment surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. High telehealth clinicians had lower SUD-related hospitalization rates. Patients of high telehealth clinicians had longer MSUD prescription days' supply. Telehealth maintained similar rates of adverse events as in-person care. Results support telehealth as a sustainable option for post-pandemic SUD treatment.",SSM - Population Health,2025-3-14,10.1016/j.ssmph.2025.101780,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Drug-related mortality, Drug overdose deaths, Substance use disorders (SUDs), Pharmacotherapy, Telehealth, COVID-19 pandemic"

We characterized “early adopters” of LAI ART and PrEP in terms of social determinants of health using a health equity lens. Our retrospective cohort included patients prescribed ART or PrEP through a large urban health system (January 2021–September 2023) in the Northeastern United States. We used electronic health record data for PrEP and ART to examine group differences between those on LAI or oral medications using analysis of variance, chi-square tests, or Fisher exact tests. Bivariate logistic regression modeled associations between LAI ART or LAI PrEP and social determinants of health. In the PrEP group, 238 patients were prescribed LAI (n = 63) or oral (n = 193) PrEP. Most PrEP patients were men (80.7%), non-Hispanic (79.5%), and White (60.7%) and had public insurance (83.1%). Compared with patients on oral PrEP, those on LAI less often experienced food insecurity, financial strain, depression, anxiety, or substance use disorders. In bivariate models, LAI PrEP inversely correlated with female sex, current smoking, depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. In the treatment group, 1194 patients were prescribed LAI (n = 76) or oral (n = 1118) ART, with a median age of 57.0 years; 63.6% were from minoritized groups.

To better understand buprenorphine prescribing patterns, this manuscript examines the frequency and characteristics of dispensed buprenorphine of ≤ 16mg, > 16-24 mg, and > 24 mg daily dose. We used IQVIA data to conduct a cross-sectional study of opioid use disorder-indicated buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies January 2019 - December 2020; categorized prescriptions as ≤ 16mg, > 16 to 24 mg, and > 24 mg daily dose; and examined overall rates and rates by patient, insurer and county characteristics, and prescriber specialty. We categorized buprenorphine prescriptions by patient sex, age cohort, primary payment source, and prescriber specialty and state and conducted univariate and bivariate analyses of buprenorphine daily dose categories overall and among clinicians frequently prescribing buprenorphine at the highest doses, > 24 mg. Approximately 19.5% ( In 2019–2020, fewer than 3% of dispensed buprenorphine prescriptions exceeded the FDA suggested maximum of 24 mg daily dose; 80% of the prescriptions for a > 24 mg daily dose were written by 4% of buprenorphine prescribers. As clinicians and policymakers pay greater attention to ensuring individuals are receiving buprenorphine dosages adequate to effectively treat their opioid use disorder, the recently revised FDA recommendations may encourage such behavior. Additionally, disproportionate reliance on cash payment for higher daily doses suggests public and private insurers could facilitate access to such treatment when appropriate.

To clarify these associations we investigated the association between different aspects of tobacco smoking and aortic dissection in the UK Biobank Study and we summarized the available data in a meta-analysis of cohort studies. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between smoking and risk of aortic dissection in the UK Biobank. PubMed and Embase were searched up to 19th of July 2024 to identify relevant cohort studies and random effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs in the meta-analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years a total of 376 incident cases of aortic dissection were identified among 499,078 participants. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for current and former smokers versus never smokers were 2.48 (1.87–3.29) and 1.03 (0.81–1.29), respectively. There was a dose-response between increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day and aortic dissection risk with HRs (95% CIs) of 2.31 (1.13–4.71), 2.94 (1.88–4.58), and 2.63 (1.65–4.37) for 1–9, 10–19, and ≥ 20 cigarettes/day among current smokers. Greater number of pack-years was positively associated with aortic dissection (1.66, 1.21–2.28 for ≥ 30 pack-years vs. never smokers).

PMC11983290,40202749,Automating the Addiction Behaviors Checklist for Problematic Opioid Use Identification,"This study attempts to determine whether regular expressions, an interpretable natural language processing technique, could automate a validated clinical tool (Addiction Behaviors Checklist) to identify problematic opioid use. Could the Addiction Behaviors Checklist be automated to efficiently identify problematic opioid use in electronic health record notes? In this cohort of patients with chronic pain, the automated approach achieved high sensitivity and positive predictive value compared with a manual review and performed significantly better than diagnostic codes. In this study, an automated approach for the Addiction Behaviors Checklist based on clinical notes performed better than diagnostic codes and can be generalizable to any electronic health record system. Individuals whose chronic pain is managed with opioids are at high risk of developing an opioid use disorder. Electronic health records (EHR) allow large-scale studies to identify a continuum of problematic opioid use, including opioid use disorder. Traditionally, this is done through diagnostic codes, which are often unreliable and underused. To determine whether regular expressions, an interpretable natural language processing technique, could automate a validated clinical tool (Addiction Behaviors Checklist) to identify problematic opioid use. This cross-sectional study reports on a retrospective cohort with data analyzed from 2021 through 2023. The approach was evaluated against a blinded, manually reviewed holdout test set and validated against an independent test set at a separate institution. The study used data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Synthetic Derivative, a deidentified version of the EHR for research purposes. This cohort comprised 8063 individuals with chronic pain, defined by diagnostic codes on at least 2 days. The study team collected free-text notes, demographics, and diagnostic codes and performed an external validation with 100 individuals with chronic pain from Geisinger, recruited from an interventional pain clinic cohort. The primary outcome was the evaluation of the automated method in identifying patients demonstrating problematic opioid use and its comparison with manual medical record review and opioid use disorder diagnostic codes. Methods with F1 scores were evaluated (a single value that combines sensitivity and positive predictive value at a single threshold) and areas under the curve (a single value that combines sensitivity and specificity across multiple thresholds). Among the 8063 patients in the primary site (5081 female [63%] and 2982 male [37%]; mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years) and 100 patients in the validation site (57 female [57%] and 43 male [43%]; mean [SD] age, 54 [13] years), the automated approach outperformed diagnostic codes based on F1 scores (0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83 vs 0.08; 95% CI, 0.00-0.19 at the primary site and 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.85 vs 0.29; 95% CI, 0.07-0.50 at the validation site) and areas under the curve (0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89 vs 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50-0.55 at the primary site and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94 vs 0.59;95% CI, 0.50-0.67 at validation site).

In this cohort study of 6 million individuals aged 45 years or older with no history of dementia, those with acute care due to cannabis use were at 1.5-fold (absolute risk, 5.0% vs 3.6%) and 3.9-fold (absolute risk, 5.0% vs 1.3%) increased risk of a new dementia diagnosis within 5 years compared with individuals with an all-cause acute care encounter and the general population, respectively. Individuals with cannabis use severe enough to require emergency department or hospital care may be at increased risk of being diagnosed with dementia. Cannabis use is associated with short-term memory impairment and long-term changes in brain structure; however, little is known about whether disordered cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of a dementia diagnosis. To investigate the association between emergency department visits or hospitalizations (acute care encounters) due to cannabis and future dementia diagnosis. Population-based, retrospective, matched cohort study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2021 (with follow-up until 2022) including all individuals aged 45 to 105 years living in Ontario who were eligible and did not have a diagnosis of dementia at cohort entry (2 620 083 individuals excluded). Individuals with incident acute care due to cannabis use, defined using  We used cause-specific adjusted hazard models to compare new diagnoses of dementia (from a validated algorithm) between individuals with acute care due to cannabis use with (1) individuals with all-cause acute care (excluding cannabis), (2) the general population, and (3) individuals with acute care due to alcohol use. The study included 6 086 794 individuals, of whom 16 275 (0.3%) had incident acute care due to cannabis use (mean age, 55.2 [SD, 8.3] years; 60.3% male). Annual rates of incident acute care due to cannabis use increased 5.0-fold in individuals aged 45 to 64 years (from 10.16 to 50.65 per 100 000) and 26.7-fold in individuals aged 65 years or older (from 0.65 to 16.99 per 100 000) between 2008 and 2021. Individuals with incident acute care due to cannabis use were at a 1.5-fold and 3.9-fold increased risk of dementia diagnosis within 5 years relative to individuals with all-cause acute care and the general population of the same age and sex, respectively (absolute rates of dementia diagnosis: 5.0% for cannabis-related acute care, 3.6% for all-cause acute care, and 1.3% in the general population). After adjustment for sociodemographics and chronic health conditions, individuals with acute care due to cannabis use remained at elevated risk relative to those with all-cause acute care (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.39) and the general population (aHR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.38-2.15). Individuals with acute care due to cannabis use were at lower risk than those with acute care due to alcohol use (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.76). Individuals with cannabis use severe enough to require hospital-based care were at increased risk of a new dementia diagnosis compared with those with all-cause hospital-based care or the general population. These findings have important implications considering increasing cannabis use among older adults.

Nevertheless, not all smokers who do not quit will necessarily develop COPD. This study aimed to examine the risk and protective factors associated with COPD among individuals who smoke. The study included a cohort of 2619 adult smokers with lung function data, whose demographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary patterns were examined using T-tests, Chi-square tests, and logical analysis. Among the study participants, 441 individuals were identified as having COPD by analyzing pulmonary function data. Advanced age (p<0.001), low body mass index (BMI, p<0.001), ethnicity (p=0.019), and comorbid asthma (p<0.001) were found to be statistically correlated with the presence of COPD. Additionally, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables (p=0.026) was shown to have a beneficial impact. After considering factors related to type 2 inflammation, nutrient intake from vegetables and fruits, and other variables, it was observed that vitamin C (p<0.001) exhibited a protective effect against COPD in smokers. Additionally, advanced age (p<0.001), low BMI (p<0.001), comorbid asthma (p<0.001), and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (p=0.032) remained significant independent risk factors for COPD in smokers. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that COPD patients who consumed fewer fruits and vegetables had lower levels of vitamin C intake (p=0.004). The findings of our study suggest that smokers who are older, have a lower BMI, and comorbid asthma are at an increased risk of developing COPD. Conversely, higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as increased intake of vitamin C, may help reduce this risk.

Research is needed to identify psychosocial interventions that support MOUD retention. To address this gap, we examined associations between a wide range of psychosocial services and buprenorphine treatment discontinuation across 18 months among a large cohort of Veterans initiating buprenorphine nationwide. We identified a cohort of patients with new buprenorphine initiation in 2017–2018 in Veterans Health Administration electronic health record data (N = 11,704). We examined prescription fills for up to 18 months after initiation. The primary outcome was first discontinuation of buprenorphine. We examined a variety of services, including psychotherapy in specialty substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health clinics, other healthcare services, and residential programs. To examine time-varying associations between psychosocial services and risk of discontinuation, we fit extended Cox regression models for each service separately and simultaneously. Overall, 80.5% of patients discontinued buprenorphine at least once within 18 months. Risk of discontinuation was 18% (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87) relatively lower following SUD psychotherapy and 26% (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.15,1.39) higher following residential treatment. Several services, including residential treatment, were associated with greater risk of subsequent buprenorphine discontinuation, whereas only SUD psychotherapy was consistently associated with lower risk of later discontinuation.

However, data on uptake and engagement with specific app features (eg, in-app messaging) are often lacking, limiting our ability to understand nuanced patterns of app use. This study aims to characterize sociodemographic differences in uptake and engagement with a smartphone app (uMAT-R) to support recovery efforts in a sample of individuals with opioid and stimulant use disorders in the Greater St. Louis area. We enrolled individuals into the uMAT-R service program from facilities providing recovery support in the Greater St. Louis area between January 2020 and April 2022. Study participants were recruited from service project enrollees. We describe the number of logins and electronic health coach (eCoach) messages participants sent in the first 30 days following enrollment using medians and IQRs and counts and proportions of those who ever (vs never) logged in and sent their eCoach a message. We compare estimates across sociodemographic subgroups, by insurance status, and for those who did and did not participate in the research component of the project using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Pearson chi-square tests. Of all 695 participants, 446 (64.2%) logged into uMAT-R at least once during the 30 days following enrollment (median 2, IQR 0-8 logins). Approximately half of those who logged in (227/446) used the eCoach messaging feature (median 1, IQR 0-3 messages). Research participants (n=498), who could receive incentives for app engagement, were more likely to log in and use the eCoach messaging feature compared to others (n=197). Younger individuals, those with higher educational attainment, and White, non-Hispanic individuals were more likely to log in at least once compared to their counterparts. The median number of logins was higher among women, and those who were younger, employed, and not on Medicaid compared to their counterparts. Among those who logged in at least once, younger individuals and those with lower educational attainment were more likely to send at least one eCoach message compared to others. Mobile apps are a viable tool for supporting individuals in recovery from opioid and stimulant use disorders. However, older individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower educational attainment may need additional login support, or benefit from alternative mechanisms of recovery support. In addition, apps may need to be tailored to achieve sustained engagement (ie, repeat logins) among men, and individuals who are older, unemployed, or on Medicaid. Older individuals and those with higher educational attainment who may be less likely to use eCoach messaging features could benefit from features tailored to their preferences.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-4-10,10.2196/54753,N/A,N/A,"

In this cohort study of 43 913 individuals who take PrEP, 14.29% had an AUD diagnosis (2.84% before and 11.45% after PrEP initiation). Mood disorders and substance use disorders were associated with AUD diagnosis. Only 8.46% of individuals with an AUD diagnosis received a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medication for AUD. The findings of this study suggest there is a need to improve AUD services among individuals who take PrEP. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) may negatively affect preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and continuation, reducing PrEP effectiveness. To estimate the prevalence of and and factors associated with AUD diagnoses among commercially insured individuals who take PrEP. This retrospective cohort study used US health care claims data to identify individuals aged 16 to 64 years who received at least 1 new PrEP prescription between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from June 2024 to February 2025. Sociodemographic characteristics included patient age, sex, geographic location, employment status, and type of health insurance. Clinical characteristics included sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis and testing, use of psychotherapy services, and diagnosis of other mental health conditions. The main outcome was an AUD diagnosis within 6 months before or after the date of PrEP initiation. Among individuals with an AUD diagnosis, receipt of medications for AUD (MAUDs), including Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved MAUDs (acamprosate, disulfiram, and oral and injectable naltrexone) and non–FDA-approved MAUDs (baclofen, gabapentin, and topiramate) was determined. The study cohort included 43 913 individuals receiving PrEP (mean [SD] age, 35.8 [10.94] years; 35 027 [90.1%] male assigned at birth). There were 6274 individuals (14.29%) who had an AUD diagnosis, with 1245 (2.84%) and 5029 (11.45%) receiving their diagnosis before and after PrEP initiation, respectively. The sociodemographic and clinical factors that were associated with an AUD diagnosis were similar whether AUD was diagnosed before or after PrEP initiation, including male sex assigned at birth (before: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], aOR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.73; after: aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and the presence of other mental health diagnoses such as depression (before: aOR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.78-3.84; after: aOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.88-3.49), anxiety (before: aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.83-2.55; after: aOR, 2.24; 95% CI, 2.04-2.46), and any substance use disorder (before: aOR, 14.54; 95% CI, 12.46-16.96; after: aOR, 13.09; 95% CI, 11.82-14.49). There were 531 individuals with AUD diagnosis (8.46%) who received an FDA-approved MAUD and 883 (14.07%) who had a claim for a non–FDA-approved MAUD. This population-based cohort study found that nearly 15% of individuals who took PrEP had an AUD diagnosis within 6 months of PrEP initiation; individuals with an AUD diagnosis were more likely to have co-occurring mental health conditions, and less than 9% received any FDA-approved MAUD. These findings suggest that interventions are needed to improve AUD services among individuals who take PrEP.",JAMA Network Open,2025-4-25,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.7295,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

There is concern that the associated stress could induce sustained prescription opioid use and substance use disorder (SUD). We sought to evaluate the incidence of sustained opioid use and SUD among servicewomen and women civilian dependents during 2006–2013, a period of increased operational intensity, compared to similar individuals in 2014–2022. We employed Military Health System claims data to identify servicewomen and dependents who were diagnosed with SUD or demonstrated sustained prescription opioid use (i.e., six months of uninterrupted use). The incidence of sustained opioid use (primary outcome) and SUD associated (secondary outcome) with 2006–2013 was compared to 2014–2022 among servicewomen and dependents. Multivariable log binomial regression was used to adjust for confounding. Ethnicity was not available in our dataset. 4,876,209 individuals were included. The average age (standard deviation [SD]) of the cohorts under study were 26.6 (SD 8.2) for active duty 2006–2013, 26.0 (SD 8.0) for active duty 2014–2022, 35.3 (SD 13.1) for dependents 2006–2013 and 33.6 (SD 12.1) for dependents 2014–2022. Compared to civilian dependents in 2014–2022, servicewomen from 2006 to 2013 demonstrated an increased risk of sustained prescription opioid use (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.46–1.53). In 2014–2022, servicewomen had a lower risk compared to dependents (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.45–0.49), while dependents in 2006–2013 were also at higher risk (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.56–1.60). Servicewomen in 2006–2013 were at significantly greater risk of developing SUD (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.08). During 2014–2022, servicewomen displayed a lower risk when compared to dependents (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.79–0.81). Dependents in 2006–2013 showed a higher risk (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.24–1.25). We found significant increases in the risks of sustained opioid use and SUD among servicewomen and civilian dependents during a period of increased operational intensity (2006–2013).

Does treatment with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy improve maternal and infant outcomes? In this cohort study of 14 463 maternal-infant dyads, treatment with buprenorphine was associated with a lower probability of severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions compared to no treatment. Buprenorphine treatment for OUD during pregnancy was associated with improved outcomes for mothers and infants, highlighting the importance of treatment expansion in the US. Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy has grown in the US. Buprenorphine, a medication to treat OUD, may improve pregnancy outcomes; however, most pregnant individuals do not receive it.

PMC12037202,40296928,Predictors of Mortality Among Patients With Opioid Use Disorder: Insights From the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Readmission Database,"Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with significantly increased mortality rates compared to the general population, driven by overdose risk, high-risk behaviors, and comorbid conditions. While opioid agonist treatment reduces mortality, identifying risk factors for death among individuals with OUD remains critical for improving outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the 2020 National Readmission Database identified OUD admissions using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Patients over 18 years of age were included, and statistical analyses, including logistic regression, assessed 30-day readmission and mortality predictors. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics for Windows, version 1.0.0.1327 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results: Nonsurvivors were generally older (median age: 58 vs. 47 years) and had a higher prevalence of severe comorbidities, including cardiac arrest (24.1% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.001), respiratory failure (83.0% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (61.9% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001). Mortality was more common among patients with Medicare (44.4% vs. 31.7%) and in larger hospitals. Psychiatric conditions, such as depression and suicidal ideation, were more frequent in survivors, suggesting potential protective effects or earlier intervention. Multivariable analysis identified cardiac arrest (odds ratio, OR: 20.210, p < 0.001), respiratory failure (OR: 9.993, p < 0.001), and liver failure (OR: 4.298, p < 0.001) as the strongest mortality predictors, while female sex and psychiatric disorders were associated with lower mortality risk. Conclusion: Mortality among patients with OUD is influenced by age, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and healthcare disparities. Integrated care approaches that address both medical and psychiatric conditions are essential for improving survival outcomes. Future research should focus on targeted interventions to mitigate high-risk factors and enhance harm reduction strategies for this vulnerable population.",Cureus,2025-3-29,10.7759/cureus.81405,N/A,N/A,"

This study examined rates of comorbid MHDs and SUDs among three groups of U.S. veterans: those experiencing homelessness, those in supported housing, and those independently housed. Administrative data on a national cohort of 5,402,062 veterans (including 181,131 homeless veterans and 29,166 veterans in supported housing) enrolled in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 2021 to 2023 were analyzed. Among homeless veterans, 28.3% had a SUD diagnosis, 62.9% a MHD diagnosis, and 24.7% comorbid MHD/SUD. Among veterans in supported housing, 38.2% had a SUD diagnosis, 67.3% a MHD diagnosis, and 32.0% comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses. Among independently housed veterans, 7.9% had a SUD diagnosis, 41.6% a MHD diagnosis, and 5.8% comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses. Homeless veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD used significantly more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than veterans in supported housing; in turn, supported housing veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD used significantly more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than independently housed veterans. Among homeless veterans with comorbid MHD/SUD diagnoses, those with addiction to central nervous system (CNS) stimulants used more outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department care than those with addiction to CNS depressants. In conclusion, the psychiatric epidemiology and comorbidity of veterans varies by housing situation, and there is continued need for psychiatric treatment among homeless veterans who enter supported housing.

We hypothesized that patients requiring EAS would carry a higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to patients that underwent the index operation alone. We conducted a retrospective analysis using TriNetX, examining data from 2016-2024 from patients over 18 years old who underwent THA/TKA and required EAS within 30 days. Postoperative outcomes, including mortality and hospital readmission, were compared between patients requiring EAS and those who did not. Statistical analyses included measures of association and chi-squared tests. Patient demographic data, including age, sex, and comorbidities were analyzed. Patients requiring EAS within 30 days of a joint arthroplasty were significantly more likely to be older, overweight or obese, and to be diagnosed with comorbidities including diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, alcohol use disorders, and tobacco use. These patients had significantly higher mortality rates within 60 days of joint arthroplasty compared to patients without EAS, suggesting that the second operation contributed significantly to the increase in adverse outcomes.   This study emphasizes the importance of recognizing key risk factors for severe GI complications that require EAS.

Patients aged ≥ 18 years with MIBC who had radical cystectomy from October 2012 to June 2018 were identified in the prospective COBLAnCE bladder cancer cohort. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. Patients were classified as MIBC-HR based on TNM staging. Disease-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 256 patients with MIBC-HR were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years and 204 patients were men (79.7%). 201 patients (78.5%) were current or former smokers. For staging, 226 patients were (y)pT3a or higher (88.3%) and 132 were N- (51.6%). Forty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.0%), and 69 received adjuvant chemotherapy (27.0%). Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy only, 59 received cisplatin-based therapy (86.8%). 182 patients (71.1%) constituted the ASO subgroup. 175 patients (68.3%) experienced an event up to the end of follow-up.

Outcomes analyzed included depression, panic disorder, suicidal ideation, and alcohol abuse, identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Risk ratios, hazard ratios, and Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were calculated, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results Cannabis use during pregnancy was associated with higher incidences of all four mental health outcomes. Alcohol abuse showed the greatest relative risk (risk ratio = 13.57; hazard ratio = 12.44), followed by suicidal ideation (risk ratio = 10.67; hazard ratio = 9.81), panic disorder (risk ratio = 5.47; hazard ratio = 5.01), and depression (risk ratio = 2.66; hazard ratio = 3.50). Depression affected 29.7% of cannabis users, compared to 11.2% of non-users, with significant differences in survival probabilities (p < 0.001). Conclusion Cannabis use during pregnancy is significantly associated with increased risks of adverse mental health outcomes. These findings emphasize the importance of screening for cannabis use and mental health conditions during pregnancy and underscore the need for public health initiatives addressing the risks of prenatal cannabis use.

PMC12076274,40370791,A statewide system for maternal-infant linked longitudinal surveillance: Indiana’s model for improving maternal and child health,"Indiana, located in the Midwest region of the United States, faces significant challenges with respect to health, especially maternal and child health (MCH). These challenges include high rates of stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and congenital syphilis (CS). Not only are these often-fatal conditions underreported, but it can also be difficult to track them longitudinally, as mothers and infants are not routinely linked through electronic health records (EHRs). This paper describes the process, structure and planned outcomes of a partnership between Indiana University, Regenstrief Institute and public health partners in support of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Pregnant People-Infant Linked Longitudinal Surveillance (PILLARS) program. Together, academic, clinical and public health organisations are collaboratively developing an infrastructure and deploying novel methods to surveil stillbirth, CS and NAS longitudinally. The infrastructure includes: (a) deploying deterministic and probabilistic algorithms to link mothers and their infants using multiple, linked data sources; (b) creating and maintaining a registry of maternal-infant dyads; (c) using the registry to perform longitudinal surveillance in collaboration with Indiana public health authorities on stillbirth, NAS and CS and (d) translating information from surveillance activities into action by collaborating with public health and community-based organisations to improve and implement prevention activities in vulnerable Indiana communities. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for these conditions and other priority MCH outcomes by expanding our work to additional MCH use cases.",International Journal of Population Data Science,2024-11-11,10.23889/ijpds.v9i2.2395,N/A,N/A,"

PMC12079652,40376191,Comparison of Outcomes of Percutaneous Mechanical Aspiration vs Tricuspid Valve Surgery in Drug Use–Associated Endocarditis of the Tricuspid Valve,"People who inject drugs (PWID) and present with infective endocarditis (IE) of the tricuspid valve may need valve surgery due to persistent infection, heart failure, or embolic risk. Vacuum-assisted percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) has been proposed as a potential option for those who cannot undergo surgery. We queried TriNetX, a database that provides access to electronic medical record data across health care organizations, to identify PWID who had tricuspid valve IE and underwent PMA between 2016 and 2024, using diagnostic and procedure codes. Short-term procedural and clinical outcomes were compared with PWID who underwent tricuspid valve surgery. In total, 129 patients underwent the PMA procedure and 952 had valve surgery. A higher proportion of the PMA cohort was female (66% vs 57%) and of non-White race (32% vs 22.5%). At 1 month postprocedure, the surgical group had a lower rate of death (2.5% vs 7.9%,  Short-term outcomes seem comparable between PMA and tricuspid valve surgery in tricuspid valve IE in PWID. Additional studies with larger cohort numbers are needed to further evaluate the difference in long-term postoperative outcomes between the groups. Percutaneous mechanical aspiration in people who inject drugs and present with tricuspid valve endocarditis may have comparable short-term procedural and clinical outcomes to those who have valve surgery.

We aimed to determine and validate whether prescriber networks, constructed with administrative data, can successfully identify distinct clinical practice facilities in Ontario, Canada. We executed a retrospective population-based cohort study using OAT prescription records from the Canadian Addiction Treatment Centres in Ontario, Canada between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2020. Social network analysis was utilized to create networks with connections between physicians based on their shared OAT clients. We defined connections two different ways, by including the number of clients shared or a relative threshold on the percentage of shared OAT clients per physician. Clinics were identified using modularity maximization, with sensitivity analyses applying Louvain, Walktrap, and Label Propagation algorithms. Concordance between network-identified facilities and the (gold standard) de-identified facility-level IDs was assessed using overall, positive and negative agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). From 144 physicians at 105 clinics with 32,842 OAT clients, we assessed 250 different versions of the created networks. The three different detection algorithms had wide variation in concordance, with ranges on sensitivity from 0.02 to 0.88 and PPV from 0.06 to 0.97. The optimal result, derived from the modularity maximization method, achieved high specificity (0.98, 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98) and NPV (0.98, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98) and moderate PPV (0.54, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.57) and sensitivity (0.45, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.47). This scenario had an overall agreement of 0.96, negative agreement of 0.98, and positive agreement of 0.49. Social network analysis can be used to identify clinics prescribing OAT in the absence of clinic-level identifiers, thus facilitating construction and comparison of clinic-level caseloads and treatment outcomes.",PLOS One,2025-5-16,10.1371/journal.pone.0322064,N/A,N/A,"

Biological age, derived from multi-system biomarkers, provides a more accurate assessment of aging than chronological age. Hydration balance, reflected by serum sodium, may modulate age-related diseases and mortality, but its link to biological aging remains underexplored. Using NHANES data (1999–2018), we focused on normonatremic adults (≥20 years). The final cohort included 18,301 participants. Biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method, and ∆age (biological age—chronological age) was calculated. Associations were assessed using multivariate regression, generalized additive models, and threshold analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for variations across different populations. Nonlinear analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between serum sodium and biological age. The lowest biological age occurred at 139.3 mmol/L: each 1 mmol/L increase below this threshold was associated with a reduction of 0.10 years in biological age (95% CI: −0.15, −0.05), whereas values above it showed a 0.08-year increase (95% CI: 0.04, 0.13). For ∆age, a negative association was observed below 141.2 mmol/L, with each increase linked to a 0.07-year decrease (95% CI: −0.10, −0.04). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions in diabetic and smoking populations. Maintaining serum sodium levels within an optimal range (138–142 mmol/L) may help delay biological aging.

This study examines the prognostic value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in OA risk stratification among elderly individuals. This retrospective analysis utilized seven NHANES cycles (2005-2018) encompassing geriatric participants (≥ 60 years) possessing complete GNRI measurements and baseline covariates. For comparative cohort balancing, propensity score matching was executed using inverse probability weighting a matched-pairs design, adjusting for age, alcohol consumption, and the Poverty Income Ratio. Multivariable-adjusted weighted logistic regression quantified GNRI-OA associations, with restricted cubic splines (RCS) characterizing nonlinear dynamics. Subgroup analyses were also performed. This cross-sectional analysis identified 656 OA cases among 3,120 rigorously screened geriatric participants. Elevated GNRI levels demonstrated a significant association with increased OA risk among geriatric populations, with the correlation remaining robust in sensitivity analyses adjusted for metabolic confounders. Specifically, a GNRI ≥ 123.63 was associated with a higher probability of OA in this population. RCS analysis revealed a significant non-linear relationship (p_non-linear < 0.001) between GNRI and OA risk, particularly among men and non-smokers. Subgroup analyses indicated that males, Hispanic Americans, Non-Hispanic Black people, non-smokers, and those with a low PIR were more sensitive to changes in GNRI. Elevated GNRI was independently associated with OA prevalence in geriatric populations, demonstrating nutritional status’s pivotal role in degenerative joint pathophysiology. The impact of GNRI on OA risk may differ across demographic subgroups, highlighting the need for personalized approaches in managing OA risk based on nutritional status.",Frontiers in Medicine,2025-5-08,10.3389/fmed.2025.1579095,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"geriatric nutritional risk index, osteoarthritis, risk factors, elderly, NHANES"

This study aimed to examine the association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA among ED visits with substance use (age 12–64 years) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study retrospectively analyzed the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2019 to 2020. The International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify opioid, cannabis, and alcohol use, and smoking. The pandemic was significantly associated with higher odds of IA (OR 1.04, CI 1.02–1.06). Female gender and rural hospitals were adversely associated with both DAMA and IA, but lower household incomes were positively and negatively associated with DAMA and IA, respectively. Race and health insurance were partly differently associated with these outcomes. Asian patients exhibited significantly lower odds (OR 0.82, CI 0.71–0.88) regarding DAMA. Black (OR 0.79, CI 0.78–0.80) and Native American patients (OR 0.87, CI 0.82–0.90) exhibited lower odds, and Hispanic (OR 1.05, CI 1.03–1.06) and Asian patients (OR 1.40, CI 1.33–1.44) had higher odds compared to White patients in terms of AI. Except for self-pay, which was associated with lower odds of IA, Medicaid, self-pay, and free care were significantly associated with higher odds of DAMA and IA. Our results also showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the association of health insurance with IA, but not with DAMA. These findings highlight the complex association of socioeconomic factors with DAMA and IA.

In this cohort study, 517 individuals were enrolled; top needs were rent and utility support, and service utilization mirrored these needs. Overall, the mean (SD) cost per member per month was $2225 ($1586). The findings of this study of a pilot program highlight a critical need for housing supports among Medicaid members and offer lessons for design and implementation of similar programs, including a key insight on the necessity of cross-sector collaboration between health care and housing organizations. This cohort study evaluates and describes the implementation and initial outcomes of a housing benefit program in Oregon. Housing instability and homelessness have wide-ranging health and social effects. Health systems increasingly recognize the importance of addressing these needs to make progress toward health equity goals and reduce health care costs. State Medicaid programs are uniquely positioned to support the housing needs of their members but are relatively new to the housing space and need to understand how to most effectively partner with the housing sector to improve health outcomes. To evaluate the implementation and initial outcomes of a housing benefit pilot program, including participant characteristics, needs, and service utilization. This was a cohort study involving a pilot program that provided temporary rental assistance, housing navigation, and additional supports to Medicaid members between May 2022 and October 2024. The pilot took place in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area involving Medicaid members of Health Share of Oregon, a large coordinated care organization. Individuals were referred to the program primarily from foster care, substance use disorder residential programs, and corrections facilities. Data were analyzed from October 2024 to March 2025. Enrolled participants received services, including temporary rental assistance, housing navigation, and other supports, for up to 12 months, with modifications made mid-pilot due to capacity challenges.

While HS has been associated with various comorbidities such as metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases, many systemic effects of this systemic disease remain to be investigated. In this study, 2 cohorts of patients with and without HS were created – matched for sex, age, and nicotine dependence – each comprising 28,986 patients, using the real-world database TriNetX, to investigate the association of ocular diseases and HS. Not only an increased risk of disorders of refraction and accommodation in HS patients (OR 3.466; 95% CI 3.100, 3.876), but also a higher risk of ocular diseases, including disorders of the lacrimal system, was demonstrated when compared with the control cohort (OR 3.523; 95%CI 2.912, 4.263).

UKB is a large cohort study with over 500,000 volunteer participants aged 40–69 years when recruited in 2006–2010. It is an important resource of extensive health, genetic and biomarker data. Enhancements to UKB enrich the data available. MHQ2 is an enhancement designed to enable and facilitate research with psychosocial and mental health aspects. UKB sent participants a link to MHQ2 by email in October-November 2022. The MHQ2 was designed by a multi-institutional consortium to build on MHQ1. It characterises lifetime depression further, adds data on panic disorder and eating disorders, repeats ‘current’ mental health measures and updates information about social circumstances. It includes established measures, such as the PHQ-9 for current depression and CIDI-SF for lifetime panic, as well as bespoke questions. Algorithms and R code were developed to facilitate analysis. At the time of analysis, MHQ2 results were available for 169,253 UKB participants, of whom 111,275 had also completed the earlier MHQ1. Characteristics of respondents and the whole UKB cohort are compared. The major phenotypes are lifetime: depression (18%); panic disorder (4.0%); a specific eating disorder (2.8%); and bipolar affective disorder I (0.4%). All mental disorders are found less with older age and also seem to be related to selected social factors. In those participants who answered both MHQ1 (2016) and MHQ2 (2022), current mental health measure showed that fewer respondents have harmful alcohol use than in 2016 (relative risk 0.84), but current depression (RR 1.07) and anxiety (RR 0.98) have not fallen, as might have been expected given the relationship with age. We also compare lifetime concepts for test-retest reliability. There are some drawbacks to UKB due to its lack of population representativeness, but where the research question does not depend on this, it offers exceptional resources that any researcher can apply to access.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in females from the UK Biobank. 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included. Detailed MHT prescription data from primary care records was available for 538. We tested for associations between the brain measures (i.e. gray/white matter brain age, hippocampal volumes, white matter hyperintensity volumes) and MHT user status, age at first and last use, duration of use, formulation, route of administration, dosage, type, and active ingredient. We further tested for the effects of a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy among MHT users and examined associations by APOE ε4 status. Current MHT users, not past users, showed older gray and white matter brain age, with a difference of up to 9 mo, and smaller hippocampal volumes compared to never-users. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post-menopause was associated with older gray and white matter brain age, larger white matter hyperintensity volume, and smaller hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed  Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history.

Bowers Women’s Brain Health Initiative (EGJ), and the National Institutes of Health (EGJ: AG063843). Ovarian hormones, including oestrogens and progesterone, fluctuate throughout each menstrual cycle, during and after pregnancy, and in the years leading up to menopause when ovarian function begins to decline. During these transitional years, up to 80% of women will experience symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, which are believed to stem from the brain. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) often contains low doses of estrogens with or without progesterone and is commonly prescribed to minimize menopausal symptoms. MHT is believed to protect the brain and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease; however, the evidence supporting this claim is conflicting. Furthermore, additional research is necessary to evaluate the risks and benefits of MHT on brain health. It remains unclear whether other factors, including a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s disease, the age at which MHT begins, the formulation, and the route of administration (e.g., pills or a transdermal patch), affect the impact of MHT on the brain. Addressing these questions is crucial to inform clinical decision-making regarding the prescription of MHT and to subsequently enhance women’s brain health during and beyond the menopause transition. Barth et al. analyzed brain imaging data as well as data about lifestyle and demographic factors and histories of gynecological surgeries, of over 20,000 current, past, and never users of MHT from the UK Biobank cohort. As a proxy for brain health, they calculated the so-called ‘brain age gap’, which refers to the difference between a person’s actual chronological age and their estimated brain age calculated from brain imaging data using machine learning; e.g., if someone’s chronological age is 50 years and their predicted brain age is 45, the brain age gap is –5 years. A negative brain age gap indicates a 'younger-looking' brain, while a positive brain age gap suggests a brain that appears 'older'. Barth et al. further looked at the volume of the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory, learning and emotion regulation. They found that women who were current MHT users had an ‘older looking brain’ than women who had never taken MHT. The volume of the hippocampus was also smaller. In past users, the age at which MHT was last taken also made a difference. Those who were older at the time of their last use after menopause had an “older looking” brain and lower hippocampal volumes. Similar results were found for women who took MHT for longer. However, women on MHT who had undergone surgery to remove their womb and/or both ovaries had a ‘younger looking brain’ than women on MHT without similar surgical histories. Interestingly, factors such as a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, differences in formulations, or methods of administration did not appear to affect brain health in this study. The findings of Barth et al. suggest that MHT does not have a general neuroprotective effect, nor does it lead to severe adverse effects on brain health. Instead, the impact of MHT on the brain may be influenced by various factors, including age, duration of use, and past surgical history. However, since the study is cross-sectional, meaning it was conducted at a single point in time, direct causality cannot be established. Future research examining the long-term impact of MHT on brain health is crucial for understanding individual risk profiles and benefits. Women around the world are faced with critical decisions regarding MHT use, yet the current lack of comprehensive research leaves them without the necessary evidence to make informed choices.",eLife,2025-5-29,10.7554/eLife.99538,N/A,N/A,"

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a 100% Medicare nursing home sample linked to Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021. Participants included long-term care residents 65 years of age or older who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants for at least 30 days. The key exposure was the use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, with day 1 of antidepressant-opioid concomitant use designated as cohort entry. Patients were followed from cohort entry until the end of 1 year, nursing home discharge, death, or study end (12/31/2021). Seven adverse outcomes included worsening pain, physical function, and depression, and counts of pain-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose (OD). We identified 127,200 older nursing home long-term residents who initiated CYP2D6-metabolized opioids while already receiving antidepressants (mean [SD] age, 84.4 [8.7] years). After covariate adjustment via inverse probability of treatment weighting, use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants concomitantly with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with a higher risk of worsening pain (relative risk:1.04 [95% CI, 1.02, 1.06];  This cohort study of older nursing home residents showed that initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants was associated with increased risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalizations, and pain-related ED visits, although the relative and absolute risks are small to moderate. Clinicians should be aware of potential worsening pain and hospital and ED visits due to pain among patients who used CYP2D6-metabolizing opioids concomitantly with antidepressants, particularly those with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants. The safety of pharmacokinetic opioid-antidepressant interactions can be affected by the sequence in which drug is initiated, with the interaction being triggered by initiation of antidepressants on existing CYP2D6-metabolized opioids (i.e., antidepressant-triggered interaction) or by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing antidepressants (i.e., opioid-triggered interaction). While the literature has examined outcomes associated with the opioid-antidepressant interaction triggered by initiation of antidepressants, no studies have yet investigated the interaction triggered by initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. The analysis assessed three clinical outcomes and four opioid-related adverse outcomes during the follow-up (up to 1 year) after the initiation of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids on existing antidepressants among 127,200 older Medicare nursing home long-term residents. We found that concomitant use of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids was associated with a higher risk of worsening pain, pain-related hospitalization, pain-related ED visits, although the relative risk and absolute risk differences of these outcomes were small to moderate. We found no difference in physical function, depressive symptoms, and incident diagnosis of OUD and OD between concomitant users of CYP2D6-inhibiting (versus CYP2D6-neutral) antidepressants with CYP2D6-metabolized opioids. Clinicians should be aware of worsening pain and pain-related hospital and ED visits among patients who used CYP2D6-metabolizing opioids concomitantly with antidepressants, especially those with CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants. The study findings are only generalizable to older nursing home long-term residents and are limited by not fully accounting for confounders, particularly those that cannot be measured in the Medicare and MDS data.

Whether exposure to ozone concentrations consistently below current U.S. regulatory limits (70 ppb, 8-hour average) is associated with newly-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear, especially among demographic subgroups. We examined associations between residential ozone and incident COPD in a large prospective cohort study in the U.S., and assessed heterogeneity by demographic subgroups. The All of Us research program followed >848,000 volunteers enrolled in 2017–2023. Among 596, 926 participants whom consented to the release of EHR data, annual average ozone concentrations from satellite measurements from 2000—2016 were linked to residential location for 376,535 participants. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate associations between ozone and incident COPD over the study period, adjusting for co-exposures and potential confounders. We assessed effect modification using cross-product terms and stratified analyses with race, sex, age, income, and smoking status. To account for non-probabilistic sampling, we applied cell weighting based on the distribution of key factors from the 2018—2022 American Community Survey. 
We identified 7,907 incident COPD cases over an average 4-year follow-up. Residential ozone concentrations (Median: 37.75 ppb, Min-Max: 29.79–51.39) were similar across subgroups.

Although opioid use is lower among pregnant women, trends mirror the general population. While pediatric exposures largely occur through prescriptions. This review presents a novel landscape analysis of pharmacology knowledge gaps in opioids in the maternal and pediatric populations. We queried PubMed for studies on 27 opioids, focusing on pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacoepidemiology (PE) or clinical trials (CT) in maternal and pediatric populations. English‐language publications were included, and data were synthesized to identify gaps. Additionally, MarketScan claims data and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels were analyzed to compare scientific evidence, opioid prescriptions/orders, and FDA recommendations. Morphine, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine are the most researched opioids in PK and PE/CT literature in both populations, but hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine are the most prescribed. Nine opioids lack FDA labels, and four of the 18 labeled drugs lack any human data. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine labels include lactation‐focused PK information, with some pediatric clinical data for the latter two. Seven opioids lack PK and PE/CT studies in the maternal population, and PK research is absent for seven opioids, and PE/CT data is lacking for eight opioids in the pediatric population. PK studies often focus on labor, delivery, and lactation accompanied by neonatal data, whereas pregnancy research mainly occurs in PE studies. In pediatric populations, study types are evenly distributed among children, but PE studies focus more on adolescents. Drug concentration is the most reported parameter in PK studies, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a key outcome in both PK and PE studies. NOWS is also researched more using real‐world data, whereas neurodevelopmental outcomes are often captured in prospective observational studies. There is substantial disparity between the most commonly researched and prescribed opioids. In particular, the opioid pharmacology knowledge gaps are larger in pregnant women and for the highly prescribed opioids hydrocodone and oxycodone. The limited human data in FDA labels underscores the need for additional studies. Studies using real‐world data can potentially help address these gaps.",Pharmacotherapy,2025-5-15,10.1002/phar.70024,N/A,N/A,"

This study evaluates 90-day postoperative complication rates and identifies risk factors for adverse outcomes in RSA and TSA patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX Research NLP Network to identify patients aged 65–90 years who underwent RSA or TSA for OA from 2006 to 2024. 1:1 propensity score matching controlled for demographics and comorbidities. Orthopedic and infectious complications were compared using multivariate logistic regression. The final matched cohort included 4,117 RSA and TSA patients. RSA was associated with significantly higher odds of orthopedic complications compared to TSA. Significant risk factors for orthopedic complications in RSA included nicotine dependence (odds ratio [OR], 1.592; P=0.001) and hypertension (OR, 1.545; P=0.001). In TSA, risk factors included male sex (OR, 0.702; P=0.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.650; P=0.016), and obesity (OR, 1.776; P<0.001). For infections, RSA risk factors were male sex (OR, 1.698; P=0.005), heart failure (OR, 2.396; P<0.001), and diabetes (OR, 1.525; P=0.039). Diabetes was the only significant risk factor in TSA (OR, 2.453; P=0.003). RSA carries a higher risk of orthopedic complications and infection than TSA within 90 days.

In this cohort study including 6.6 million person-years from 1.7 million children, early state school Medicaid expansions were associated with an 8.9–percentage point increase in the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services. This growth was primarily driven by school claims for nursing services and for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment services. Given the complex health and health care needs of children growing up amid the opioid crisis, integrating health care into schools may offer a promising policy solution. This cohort study estimates the early effects of state school Medicaid expansions on the receipt of Medicaid-funded school-based health services among children who have experienced parental opioid use disorder. Children experiencing parental opioid use disorder are a growing population at heightened risk of physical and mental health issues over the life course. Yet these children are less likely to receive comprehensive, ongoing health care and their parents are more likely to report barriers to access health care for their children. School-based health services have potential to overcome some of these health care access barriers, including parental burden, transportation, time, costs, and health care discontinuity. In 2014, Medicaid revoked its longstanding free care rule, expanding the scope of school-based health services eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Subsequently, some states began to expand their school Medicaid programs to benefit from the new federal rule.

To assess the long-term risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), prediabetes, and mortality that are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX United States Collaborative Network to examine outcomes, especially T2DM, prediabetes and mortality, related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in females aged 21-45. Participants had no history of hypertension or diabetes before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. Propensity score matching was applied to balance covariates such as gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, overweight/obesity, nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse, and healthcare utilization. This ensured comparability between groups and reduced potential confounding in outcome evaluation. This study included 318544 females aged 21-45 with and without PIH. Females with PIH had higher risks of T2DM [hazard ratio (HR): 1.907, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.821-1.998), prediabetes (HR: 1.610, 95%CI: 1.537-1.687), and mortality (HR: 1.501, 95%CI: 1.361-1.655) over a follow-up of up to 18 years. Incidence rates for T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality were 3.2%, 2.7%, and 0.6%, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the presence of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia increased risks across all outcomes. Persistent hypertension beyond 12 weeks postpartum was linked to more than a 3-fold increase in mortality. Preventative aspirin use during pregnancy did not reduce the risks of T2DM, prediabetes, or mortality among those with PIH. PIH significantly increases the long-term risks of T2DM, prediabetes, and mortality, highlighting the urgent need for improved long-term management strategies to enhance overall health in such individuals.",World Journal of Diabetes,2025-6-15,10.4239/wjd.v16.i6.105080,N/A,N/A,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung City 40705, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan; Department of Occupational Health Nursing Center, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan; Department of Health Policy and Management, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan.

PMC12200650,40569933,Trends of long-term opioid therapy and subsequent discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain in UK primary care: A retrospective cohort study,"To examine trends of opioid use, focusing on long-term opioid therapy (L-TOT) and its discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Retrospective cohort study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum data. Incident opioid users (no opioid use in the prior year) with CNCP between 01/01/2009–31/12/2019. Among them, we identified L-TOT users (≥3 opioid prescriptions within 90 days, or total ≥90 supply days within the first year, excluding the initial 30 days) and L-TOT discontinuers (no opioid use for ≥180 days following a L-TOT). Yearly rates of incident opioid users (over CPRD-registered patients), L-TOT users (over incident opioid users), and L-TOT discontinuers (over L-TOT users) were calculated. Annual counts of each group were fitted using segmented negative binomial regression models with an offset considering their corresponding denominators from 2009 to 2019, excluding 2014 due to policy changes in that year. Among 2,839,161 incident opioid users, 11.4% (n = 324,877) transitioned into L-TOT users within one year, of which 4.8% (n = 15,484) discontinued. Between 2009–2013, rates of L-TOT users significantly declined by 2.6% (incidence rate ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.971 to 0.978) per annum, followed by a significant step change in 2015 (1.026, 1.009 to1.044), and a significant annual increase of 2.4% (1.024, 1.019 to 1.029) from 2015 to 2019, compared to the 2009–2013 trend. The annual rates of L-TOT discontinuers remained stable from 2009 to 2013 (0.987, 0.971 to 1.002), followed by a non-significant step change (0.990, 0.916 to 1.070) in 2015, and a significant decrease in slope by 2.6% (0.974, 0.951 to 0.998) per annum during 2015–2019, relative to 2009–2013. L-TOT has plateaued since 2015, accompanied with an accelerated decrease in discontinuation rates, suggesting ongoing reliance on opioids for CNCP management, despite increased awareness regarding L-TOT associated risks.

What percentage of US opioid treatment programs (OTPs) offer all 3 forms of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone), and what are characteristics of OTPs with wider MOUD availability? In this cross-sectional study of 10 298 facility-year observations from 2017 to 2023, the percentage of OTPs offering all 3 MOUD increased from 33% to 45%. Wider MOUD availability was associated with accepting Medicare, government or nonprofit ownership, and offering mental health services. Despite progress, most OTPs nationwide still did not provide all 3 MOUD options, highlighting the need for increased efforts to encourage comprehensive MOUD offering. As the primary facilities authorized to dispense methadone, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are a critical access point for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, research is limited on the extent to which OTPs offer a broad range of MOUD and on the characteristics of programs that provide more comprehensive medication offerings. To assess the percentage of US OTPs offering all 3 forms of MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) and compare organizational and county characteristics of OTPs with different MOUD service offerings. This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data on a panel of OTPs listed in the annual National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Use Treatment Facilities from 2017 to 2023. Measures included the percentage of OTPs offering buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, or all 3 MOUD from 2017 to 2023 (assuming all OTPs offered methadone). Descriptive statistics on organizational and county characteristics of OTPs by MOUD offerings were collected. Three longitudinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of different MOUD offerings within OTPs, adjusting for organizational and county-level characteristics. This analysis included 10 298 facility-year observations, ranging from 1211 in 2017 to 1421 in 2023. From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of OTPs offering MOUD beyond methadone increased (buprenorphine: 811 [67.0%] in 2017 to 1209 [85.1%] in 2023; naltrexone: 463 [38.2%] in 2017 to 749 [52.7%] in 2023; all 3 MOUD: 402 [33.2%] in 2017 to 639 [45.0%] in 2023). OTPs offering all 3 MOUD (3985 [38.7%]) had significantly higher odds of accepting Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.67-2.74); offering peer services (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25-2.12), mental health services (AOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.80), and telemedicine services (AOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92); and being private nonprofit (AOR, 7.45; 95% CI, 4.67-11.87) or government operated (AOR, 41.83; 95% CI, 19.71-88.75) compared with private for profit. In this cross-sectional study of OTPs, although the availability of MOUD beyond methadone increased over time, most OTPs still did not offer all 3 forms of MOUD as of 2023. Specific organizational characteristics, such as being government operated and accepting Medicare, were associated with more comprehensive MOUD offerings.

In this cohort study of more than 176 000 opioid-related events from 2017 to 2022, adjusted estimated probabilities showed that Black (17.1%) and Hispanic patients (16.2%) were significantly less likely than White patients (20.5%) to receive buprenorphine. Patients had higher odds of receiving buprenorphine with Medicaid and Medicare Advantage compared with commercial insurance. Despite overall improvements, significant racial and ethnic–based and insurance-based disparities in MOUD access persist and require urgent, targeted solutions. Despite expanded efforts to improve treatment access, inequities exist in the receipt of medications for opioid use disorder by race and ethnicity and insurance type. To examine inequities in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)—specifically buprenorphine and naltrexone—by race and ethnicity and insurance type after opioid-related health care events. This retrospective cohort study used data from the Institute for Health Equity Research Multi-Payor Claims Database, which includes more than 130 million individuals across commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage insurance plans. The cohort consisted of patients aged 18 years or older with an opioid use disorder (OUD)–related health care event (opioid-related overdose, infection, or treatment event) that occurred between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 2023 to December 2024. Race and ethnicity and insurance type, including commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage, were the primary exposures. The primary outcome was receipt of MOUD (buprenorphine or naltrexone) within 180 days of an OUD-related health care event. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of MOUD receipt with race and ethnicity and with insurance type, adjusting for demographic, clinical, time, and geographical covariates. Among 176 997 index events involving 164 728 patients between 2017 and 2022, the mean (SD) patient age was 40.0 (13.1) years; 104 005 (58.8%) involved men; 1083 events (0.6%) were among Asian patients, 23 424 (13.2%) were among Black patients, 10 302 (5.8%) were among Hispanic patients, 90 124 (50.9%) were among White patients, and 4697 (2.7%) were among patients of other race and ethnicity; and 147 257 (83.2%) were covered by Medicaid. Black (adjusted estimated probability, 17.1% [95% CI, 13.0%-21.1%]) and Hispanic (adjusted estimated probability, 16.2% [95% CI, 11.6%-20.8%]) patients were significantly less likely than White patients (adjusted estimated probability, 20.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-24.7%]) to receive buprenorphine (Black patients: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90]; adjusted risk difference [ARD], −3.4 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, –6.5 to –0.4 pp]; Hispanic patients: AOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.92]; ARD, –4.4 pp [95% CI, –9.1 to 0.4 pp]) but received naltrexone at similar rates. Patients with Medicaid (AOR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.14-1.69]; ARD, 3.5 pp [95% CI, 0.9-6.1 pp]) or Medicare Advantage (AOR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]; ARD, 3.6 pp [95% CI, –0.6 to 7.7 pp]) were more likely to receive buprenorphine compared with those with commercial insurance. Buprenorphine access improved incrementally from 2017 to 2022, reflecting recent clinical and policy changes; however, disparities persisted. In this cohort study of more than 17 600 opioid-related index health care events, race and ethnicity–based and insurance-based disparities in access to MOUD persisted despite efforts to expand treatment availability. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including culturally tailored care, expanded access points, and policy reforms to address structural barriers and reduce inequities contributing to the overdose crisis.

PMC12205403,40577006,Postpartum Medicaid Use in Birthing Parents and Access to Financed Care,"Is 12 months of postpartum Medicaid coverage in North Carolina provided to birthing parents associated with greater access to Medicaid-financed health care? In this cohort study of 353 957 Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina, extended postpartum Medicaid coverage programs was associated with prolonged enrollment to at least 12 months for the more than 95% of affected beneficiaries. This facilitated covered visits for contraceptive care, primary care, mental health care, and substance use disorder. In this study, a 12-month postpartum Medicaid coverage program was associated with improved Medicaid coverage and increased utilization of Medicaid-financed services that potentially could mitigate key adverse outcomes. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 allowed states to expand pregnancy Medicaid coverage to 12 months post partum. How the new policy affects Medicaid coverage and health care utilization is largely unknown. To quantify insurance coverage and care utilization for postpartum individuals under Medicaid policies that extended postpartum coverage to 12 months after delivery from 60 days. A retrospective study of Medicaid coverage and utilization in North Carolina using Medicaid claims from March 2016 to December 2023 was conducted. All Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022 were included. A total of 3 periods were differentiated: before the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), during the PHE when there was a moratorium on Medicaid disenrollment, and after North Carolina adopted the 12-month postpartum extension through the American Rescue Plan of 2021. Length and type of postpartum Medicaid enrollment were evaluated. Utilization outcomes included indicators of (1) the receipt of at least 1 postpartum visit; (2) any contraceptive visit; (3) any primary care visit; (4) any outpatient mental health care, and (5) any outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) care. There were 353 957 Medicaid-funded births in North Carolina from January 2017 through December 2022. During the postpartum extension, Medicaid recipients were more likely to have been continuously covered by comprehensive Medicaid at 12 months post partum (97.1% vs 26.5% pre-PHE). Beneficiaries in the extended coverage cohorts were substantially more likely to use Medicaid-financed care than those in the pre-PHE cohort for contraception (47.8% for the PHE cohort and 47.9% for the extension cohort vs 38.0% for the pre-PHE cohort), primary care (68.1% for the PHE cohort and 71.4% for the extension cohort vs 25.3% for the pre-PHE cohort), mental health (22.1% for the PHE cohort and 25.7% for the extension cohort vs 7.5% for the pre-PHE cohort) and substance use disorder visits (3.6% for the PHE cohort and 5.3% for the extension cohort vs 2.2%for the pre-PHE cohort) within 12 months, although there was evidence of delays in early postpartum and contraceptive visits. Results of this study suggest that extending Medicaid coverage for 12 months post partum was associated with expanded opportunities for greater access to Medicaid-financed medical and behavioral health care. Both prevention and ongoing treatment of chronic conditions may help mitigate key adverse outcomes. Findings may help policymakers and public health officials understand how extended coverage affects access to Medicaid-financed care. This cohort study assesses whether 12 months of postpartum Medicaid coverage in North Carolina provided to birthing parents was associated with greater access to Medicaid-financed health care.",JAMA Health Forum,2025-6-27,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1630,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

We examined rates and risk factors for persistent opioid use and all-cause mortality after the first-year breast cancer survivorship. This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California for women diagnosed with a nonmetastatic breast cancer between 2009 and 2019 who filled 2 or more opioid prescriptions. Rates of persistent opioid use were estimated from first-year survivorship through December 31, 2021. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with persistent use were estimated using a multivariable Poisson regression model. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality associated with persistent opioid use were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Of 14 347 eligible individuals (mean [SD] age = 61.9 [12.5]), 2285 (15.9%) developed persistent opioid use, with an incident rate of 25.5 per 1000 person-years.

This study explored the association between the neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) and diabetes prevalence and mortality. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. The correlation between NHR and the prevalence of diabetes was evaluated using logistic regression models. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to investigate whether NHR related to the risk of mortality from all causes and cardiovascular diseases. A series of sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. Among the 52,428 study participants, 8,114 (15.48%) had diabetes, with a mean neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) of 3.49. In the full-adjusted model, each unit increase in NHR was related to a 17.0% higher risk of diabetes (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI 1.13–1.21],  Elevated NHR is linked to higher diabetes prevalence and increased mortality risk in a U.S. population, independent of traditional risk factors.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing PRES; however, it is unclear whether this risk is primarily driven by comorbid conditions or if renal dysfunction itself is an independent risk factor. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, outcomes, and resource utilization of PRES across CKD stages compared with patients without kidney disease. A retrospective study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database. Adult patients nonelectively admitted with PRES from 2016 to 2019. Different stages of CKD versus no kidney disease All-cause in-hospital mortality, Incidence of PRES hospitalizations, in-hospital morbidity (intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, brain herniation, and status epilepticus), and health care resource utilization (length of hospital stay and total hospitalization charges) Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted using survey design methods. The cohort included 12,605 patients, representing 0.014% of all admissions. PRES incidence increased from 0.013% in 2016 to 0.015% in 2019 ( The use of administrative data limits access to detailed clinical information. Residual confounding factors remain possible. This is the largest study to date on PRES in CKD populations. CKD is strongly associated with PRES, with a dose-response relationship, and KF is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical vigilance in this population. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a serious brain condition that can cause seizures, confusion, and even death if not recognized and treated in time. However, it is often overlooked because its symptoms can be vague. While PRES is commonly linked to high blood pressure and immune system diseases, its connection to chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been unclear. This study used a large national database to examine how often PRES occurs in people with CKD and its impact on their health. The findings show that the risk of PRES increases as kidney disease worsens, with patients in kidney failure being the most vulnerable. These results highlight the need for early recognition and close monitoring of patients with CKD to improve their care.",Kidney Medicine,2025-5-08,10.1016/j.xkme.2025.101022,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, nationwide inpatient sample, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, end-stage kidney disease, In-hospital mortality"

Utilizing cross-sectional data from 18,500 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005–2018 cycle), we developed a composite exposure model integrating BDoH (smoking status, physical activity, dietary quality) and MDoH (obesity metrics, hypertension, diabetes) through standardized questionnaires and clinical measurements. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were calculated from peripheral blood cell counts.

However, the impact of a comprehensive healthy lifestyle as a potential mediator between SES and COPD risk remains understudied. This study analyzed data from 32,836 US adults in the NHANES (1999–2020) and 131,872 UK adults in the UK Biobank. SES was assessed via latent class analysis based on income, education, employment, and health insurance (NHANES). SES was categorized into high, middle, and low levels. Healthy lifestyle scores included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Weighted multivariable logistic regression (NHANES) and Cox proportional hazards models (UK Biobank) were used to assess the associations between SES and the prevalence (NHANES) or incidence (UK Biobank) of COPD. In the UK Biobank, the incidences of newly diagnosed COPD in the high-, medium-, and low-SES groups were 1.27%, 2.92%, and 6.57%, respectively. In the U.S. NHANES, the prevalence rates of COPD were 2.55%, 2.53%, and 4.50%, respectively. Compared with the highest SES group, a low SES was a risk factor for both the incidence and prevalence of COPD (UK Biobank: HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.98 to 3.58; NHANES: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.10). The percentages of the mediation effect of a healthy lifestyle in the UK Biobank and US NHANES were 2.81% and 37.27%, respectively. Additionally, compared with those in the group with the highest SES and the healthiest lifestyle, the risk of COPD incidence and prevalence increased by 950% (HR = 10.50, 95% CI = 9.04 to 12.20) and 641% (OR = 7.41, 95% CI = 5.10 to 10.78), respectively, in the group with the lowest SES and the unhealthiest lifestyle. Risk factor analysis for COPD revealed that, in addition to a low SES (HR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.39 to 2.72; OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.46) and unhealthy lifestyle (HR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.73 to 3.12; OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.13 to 4.57), smoking (HR = 5.23, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.61; OR = 3.85, 95% CI = 3.23 to 4.59) was the most significant risk factor for COPD. Low SES significantly contributes to COPD risk, but a healthy lifestyle mediating this association. Promoting healthy lifestyle choices and addressing socioeconomic disparities are essential public health strategies for COPD prevention.

PMC12225070,40611010,Construction and validation of a risk prediction model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a cross-sectional study based on the NHANES database from 2009 to 2018,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global public health concern, and early screening and identification of high-risk populations are critical for reducing the disease burden. Although several studies have explored the application of machine learning methods in COPD risk prediction, existing models often have limited feature dimensions and insufficient interpretability. Identifying key risk factors and constructing reliable predictive models remain challenges in clinical practice. This study aims to integrate multidimensional features based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and to compare the performance of different machine learning models in COPD risk prediction. The goal is to identify the optimal model and enhance its clinical applicability through interpretability analysis. This study utilized data from the NHANES collected between 2009 and 2018. After systematic feature selection and preprocessing, three models were developed: multivariate binary logistic regression, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Model training and evaluation were performed using stratified five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was comprehensively assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To enhance model transparency, the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was employed to interpret key features and their influence trends within the MLP model. The MLP model demonstrated the best performance across all evaluation metrics, achieving an average accuracy of 0.937, precision of 0.6624, recall of 0.6535, and F1 score of 0.657 in stratified five-fold cross-validation. The performance gap between the training and testing sets was minimal, indicating no obvious overfitting. SHAP analysis identified smoking years, asthma, age, dietary health status, total protein, red cell distribution width (RDW), BMI, marital status, secondhand smoke exposure, and total bilirubin as important predictive features. Furthermore, dependence plots revealed critical risk inflection points for key continuous variables. Based on large-scale and multidimensional feature data, this study constructed a COPD risk prediction model with favorable performance and enhanced interpretability. The findings suggest that the MLP model has the potential to effectively identify individuals at high risk for COPD and may offer value in clinical applications. Future studies are warranted to integrate longitudinal follow-up data and multimodal information to further improve predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability, thereby providing a more robust foundation for early screening and personalized interventions in COPD.",BMC Pulmonary Medicine,2025-7-3,10.1186/s12890-025-03776-w,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"COPD, NHANES database, Risk prediction model, Machine learning"

Both treatments are highly regulated, with prepandemic requirements for in-person care. COVID-19 may have resulted in barriers to accessing in-person care through disruptions in care delivery. However, there were also opportunities for improved access to telemedicine visits through policy changes. This study aims to evaluate changes in health care and telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic among patients using buprenorphine for OUD and long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. We used administrative claims data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. We included patients using buprenorphine for OUD or long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain compared to patients with another chronic condition without similar prescribing restrictions: serious mental illness. We evaluated changes in in-person and telemedicine care by comparing rates of services by physician specialty, type of service, and the percentage of visits through telemedicine. Changes in usage were measured using a difference-in-differences approach with Poisson regression. The results are presented as incident rate ratios (IRR). We found declines in in-person visits in April 2020 across the buprenorphine, chronic opioids, and serious mental illness cohorts. The largest declines were for specialties that rely on in-person treatment, such as emergency medicine (IRR range 0.60-0.62), orthopedics (IRR 0.48-0.52), cardiology (IRR 0.64-0.78), and oncology (IRR 0.77-0.81). In contrast, there were smaller declines for specialties that could more easily transition to telemedicine, namely family practice (IRR 0.80-0.92), mental health (IRR 0.92-1.01), and pain medicine (IRR 0.87-1.08). The percentage of telemedicine visits for these specialties ranged from 30% to 51% in the period. There were also large declines for specific services, including emergency medicine (IRR 0.53-0.89), physical therapy (IRR 0.24-0.72), and new office visits (IRR 0.38-0.64). By January 2022, usage was similar to prepandemic levels, but the percentage of telemedicine visits remained elevated for family practice (10%-14%), mental health (34%-43%), and pain medicine (11%-15%) through January 2022. The results were similar across the cohorts, although in April 2020 there was a modest decrease (IRR 0.87) for pain medicine in the serious mental illness cohort, but the differences were not significant for the buprenorphine (IRR 1.08) and chronic opioids (IRR: 0.99) cohorts. These findings highlight the value of telemedicine to maintain access among people at risk for poor outcomes if care is interrupted. While flexibilities in the regulation of telemedicine services that arose during the pandemic have been temporarily extended multiple times, they are set to expire in 2025 without further action. Making these changes to telemedicine regulation permanent may benefit vulnerable patient populations who face access to care challenges.",JMIR Formative Research,2025-6-19,10.2196/66596,N/A,N/A,"

This study aimed to determine if similar relationships exist in meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT). To compare clinical outcomes and failure rates for patients who underwent MAT based on presence or absence of self-reported drug allergies. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A retrospective review of patients who underwent MAT from January 2004 to December 2021 at a single academic medical institution was conducted with minimum follow-up of 2 years. Age, sex, body mass index, and presence of concomitant procedures were collected. The presence or absence of patient-reported allergies was recorded from the electronic medical record. Graft failure was defined as removal or revision of primary MAT, subsequent cartilage procedure, or progression to arthroplasty. The Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and all Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were compared for each patient from preoperative to 2-year time points. The minimal clinically important difference was determined using distribution-based method. A total of 107 patients who underwent MAT with minimum follow-up of 2 years were included in the study. Of the total, 22 (20.6%) had self-reported ≥1 medication allergy and 85 (79.4%) did not report any medication allergies. There were no significant differences between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts in other demographic variables. There was no significant difference in failure rate between the no-allergy and allergy cohorts (18.1% vs 8.2%;  The presence of self-reported drug allergies does not appear to adversely affect clinically significant outcome improvement or graft survival rates in patients undergoing MAT.

Using primary care Clinical Research Practice Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, we matched people with an incident eating disorder diagnosis (any, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, EDNOS, generic eating disorder, or a referral code) from primary care Read codes to four people without eating disorders (1:4 matching) on year of birth, sex, primary care practice, year of registration, and index date. We used univariable and multivariable Cox (mortality) and Poisson (admissions) models and fitted interactions to investigate whether associations varied by socio-demographic characteristics. We included 58,735 people (90.1% female, 91.6% white). People with any eating disorders had higher all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio[HR]: 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73 – 2.67).
